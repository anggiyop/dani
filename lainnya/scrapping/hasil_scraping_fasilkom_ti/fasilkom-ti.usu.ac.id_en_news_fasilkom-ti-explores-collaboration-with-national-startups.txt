Fasilkom-TI USU explored collaborations with startups at AIIS 2023 and met APNIC and Alibaba Cloud, aiming to enhance education, research, and resources.

The Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (Fasilkom-TI) at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) explored collaboration with national startup companies over two days from August 10-11, 2023. This initiative aimed to establish new partnerships with high-quality industries to support the development of education, research, and resources within Fasilkom-TI.

On the first day, Fasilkom-TI attended the Artificial Intelligence Innovation Summit (AIIS) 2023 at Jakarta International Expo. Organized by KORIKA (Collaboration for Artificial Intelligence Research and Innovation) and CTIS (Center for Technology & Innovation Studies), the event featured a dynamic conference and immersive exhibition highlighting the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) across various industries. AIIS 2023 emphasized four main missions: leveraging collaboration for national progress, empowering innovative thinking with character and competence, building data ecosystems and infrastructure, and promoting national advancement while upholding ethics for a harmonious digital future.

On the second day, Fasilkom-TI met with Wita Laksono, Senior Internet Resources Analyst at APNIC (Asia-Pacific Network Information Center), to discuss potential collaboration opportunities between Fasilkom-TI and APNIC. APNIC is a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) serving the Asia-Pacific region, covering 56 countries in Asia and Oceania, and is divided into four sub-regions: South, Southeast, East, and Oceania.

Fasilkom-TI then visited Alibaba Cloud, a division of Alibaba Group specializing in cloud computing. Alibaba Cloud Academy offers over 300 online and offline training sessions to enhance the cloud computing skills of its business partners, including Resellers, Service Partners, and Technology Partners. The Academy also provides professional certification and training to deepen partners’ knowledge of Alibaba Cloud’s products. After discussing potential collaborations, Fasilkom-TI toured Alibaba Cloud’s office, observed the company’s work environment, and exchanged souvenirs with Alibaba Cloud representatives.

The activities aim to foster mutually beneficial collaborations between Fasilkom-TI and industry partners, enhance the quality of education, research, and human resources, and achieve the university's performance indicators (IKU).
