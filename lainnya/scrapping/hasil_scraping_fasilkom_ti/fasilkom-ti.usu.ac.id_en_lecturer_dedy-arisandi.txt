Throughout his life journey, Mr. Dedy always motivates himself by remembering the advice he received during his lifetime: "Demanding knowledge is an effort made to change behavior towards a better direction because knowledge leads to truth and leaves ignorance. Verily, Allah hates those who are clever in the world's affairs but ignorant in the affairs of the hereafter. The most intelligent people are the ones who remember death the most and are best prepared to face what comes after."
