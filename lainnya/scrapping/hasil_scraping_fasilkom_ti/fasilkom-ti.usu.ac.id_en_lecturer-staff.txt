Community Service

Community service is a main pillar for our academic community, which is enthusiastically involved in various initiatives to disseminate the benefits of knowledge outside the university environment. Through community service projects, we utilize the diversity of research to have a direct positive impact on the community. From educational programs to practical solutions for local problems, every effort reflects our active involvement in bridging the divide between the academic world and the real needs of the community. Lecturers, as agents of change, use the diversity of research to create relevant and innovative solutions that provide real benefits in overcoming the challenges faced by today's society.
