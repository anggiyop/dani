The Augmented Reality-based Smart Comic Learning (Scolar) team from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (Fasilkom-TI) Universitas Sumatera Utara brought a silver medal in the poster category competition at the 36th National Scientific Week (PIMNAS) held on November 27-30, 2023 at Padjadjaran University, Bandung.


The Scolar Team participated in two categories of competition, namely presentations and posters. The poster made by the Scolar Team discusses the background and purpose of the presence of Scolar as bullying prevention education, discusses the implementation of Student Creativity Week - Entrepreneurship (PKM-K) activities that have been carried out from June - November 2023, and the advantages of the innovative products made.


Before achieving this victory, the Scolar Team has gone through many things such as marketing, sales charts, analysis, finance, and business sustainability. The advantages of the innovative products they made were very promising, namely products in the form of colorful comics, storylines wrapped in mission completion, AR-based applications with 3D characters and voice over, interactive games, mini quizzes, and bullying articles.

The plan for the next stage of the product that has been made is to add a series of comic publications and conduct promotions in 128 elementary schools (SD) in Binjai city according to the results of the hearing with the Binjai city Education Office that has been carried out. As for further plans, the Scolar Team wants to expand the market expansion and establish a business entity.

The Scolar Team explained that PIMNAS is an impactful event for Indonesian students. Besides being able to make the university proud, participating in PIMNAS can recognize and network with universities outside Sumatra. They also added, for students who wish to participate in PIMNAS, they can prepare themselves from now on and start forming teams and innovation ideas.
