The collaboration agenda covered discussions on internships for undergraduate and master's programs, mobility programs, research collaboration, offshore programs, exchange programs, jointly/dual programs, journals, conferences, research/grant collaboration, and staff exchanges between the two universities. The offshore program, designed by UPM, includes its curriculum and will be implemented at USU.

Additionally, student mobility was addressed through a student exchange program, where both USU and UPM will send their students for the exchange.

For staff exchange, UPM will invite USU lecturers to teach, conduct research, and engage in discussions.
