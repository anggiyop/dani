Medan, MTIF Public Relations – The Master’s Program in Informatics Engineering (MTIF) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) participated in the technical guidance (Bimtek) for the development of an Outcome-Based Education (OBE) curriculum for the field of Informatics and Computer Science, held on Friday to Saturday (February 17–18) at Hotel Putra Mulia Medan. The activity was organized by the Indonesian Association of Higher Education in Informatics and Computing (APTIKOM) North Sumatra Region in collaboration with STMIK Kaputama as the host, and several universities and organizations as co-hosts, including IOCSScience, UMI, STIKOM Tunas Bangsa, and ITB Indonesia.

 

This technical guidance event was attended by 10 representatives from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (Fasilkom-TI) of Universitas Sumatera Utara, representing five study programs in Informatics and Computer Science: Undergraduate Program in Computer Science, Undergraduate Program in Information Technology, Master’s Program in Informatics Engineering, Master’s Program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and Doctoral Program in Computer Science. In addition, 87 other participants from 33 public and private universities in the North Sumatra Region were also present. 

 

The materials for the technical guidance were presented clearly and systematically by Prihandoko, M.IT., Ph.D., the Chair of the APTIKOM Study Program Forum, complete with examples that were easy for participants to understand. After the material presentation, participants were asked to directly practice drafting an Informatics curriculum, accompanied by technical guidance facilitators Dr. Erwin Budi Setiawan, S.Si., M.T., and Dr. Iman Marzuki Shofi, S.Si., M.T. This OBE curriculum drafting practice, which took place on the first day until 9:00 p.m. WIB, was followed on the second day by a presentation session on the progress of the OBE-based curriculum development. Three participant representatives presented their curriculum drafts: Universitas Sumatera Utara, Universitas Methodist Indonesia, and Universitas Medan Area. 

 

Separately interviewed by MTIF Public Relations, the Secretary of the MTIF USU Study Program, Indra Aulia, S.TI., M.Kom., who fully participated from the first to the second day, expressed his deep appreciation to APTIKOM North Sumatra Region for facilitating this activity and extended gratitude to all parties who contributed to its success. He also expressed hope that implementing the OBE curriculum would significantly improve master’s-level education by producing graduates who possess strong hard skills and outstanding soft skills at both national and international levels.
