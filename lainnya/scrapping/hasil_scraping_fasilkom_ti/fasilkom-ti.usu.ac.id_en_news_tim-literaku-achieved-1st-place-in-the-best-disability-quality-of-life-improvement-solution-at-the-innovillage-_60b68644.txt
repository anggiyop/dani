Team Literaku, representing the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (Fasilkom-TI) at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), achieved 1st place at the Innovillage Awards 2024 for The Best Disability Quality of Life Improvement Solution. The Innovillage Awards 2024, organized by Telkom University, took place on Saturday, March 9, 2024, at the Auditorium of Damar Building, Telkom University.

The Innovillage Awards is a social project program in collaboration with PT Telkom Indonesia and Telkom University. This year, Innovillage 2024 adopted the theme "Empowering Young Sociopreneurs for National Development" or "Innovative Sociopreneurship for Sustainable Transformation." The implementation of the Innovillage 2024 program aligns with the government's initiative through Merdeka Belajar - Kampus Merdeka (MBKM), which has been implemented and adopted in higher education learning systems.

Innovillage 2024 was participated by 2,385 students, 446 accompanying lecturers, and 795 teams from 146 universities across Indonesia. Through the selection of proposal submissions, 163 social projects were chosen to receive implementation funding totaling 2.4 billion IDR.

In this competition, Team Literaku consisted of Dr. Amalia, S.T., M.T. as the supervising lecturer, Farhan Doli Fadhiil Siagian as the team leader, and Andrew Benedictus Jamesie and Ariel Matius Surbakti as team members from the Computer Science undergraduate program, class of 2020. The social project presented by Team Literaku was titled "LITERAKU: Voice-based Book Innovation to Improve Literacy for the Visually Impaired at SLB-A Tanjung Morawa." Following their win, Team Literaku will enter the incubation phase for further development of their social project to ensure sustainable implementation.

Literaku serves as a literacy solution for the visually impaired, supporting educational opportunities for all. Initiated in 2022, Literaku began as a research project under the Student Creativity Program - Karsa Cipta (PKM-KC). Since its initial launch on the Google Play Store, Literaku has undergone several developments and updates.
