Fani Windari, a USU student, won 2nd place at the AORTA Innovation Challenge 2024, showcasing innovation in youth health and inspiring future generations.

Fani Windari, a student in the Bachelor of Information Technology program from the 2021 cohort, has successfully brought recognition to Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) by securing 2nd place in the Higher Education category at the AORTA Innovation Challenge (AIC) organized by ASTRA in Jakarta on August 30, 2024.

The AORTA Innovation Challenge (AIC) is a prestigious annual event focused on health innovation. This competition invites participants from various backgrounds, ranging from high school students to university students, to generate creative ideas that support youth health and positively impact the wider community.

In this competition, Fani presented her outstanding innovation, which received praise from the judges, earning her a second-place finish in the higher education category. This achievement is not only a point of pride for Fani but also for the entire academic community at USU, particularly the Faculty of Computer Science - Information Technology (Fasilkom - TI). This success demonstrates their ability to compete at the national level and contribute meaningfully to creating health solutions for young people.

The AIC, held annually by ASTRA, reflects the company's commitment to supporting health innovation, especially focusing on critical issues such as youth health. Through this platform, participants are challenged to develop ideas that are not only creative but also applicable in daily life, with the potential to make a positive impact on their communities.

With this achievement, Fani is expected to inspire other students to continue developing creativity and innovation, particularly in the field of health. May more young generations be motivated to innovate for a healthier and more prosperous Indonesia.

Congratulations to Fani Windari on her achievement!
