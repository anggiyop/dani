Profile

Ade Candra joined Universitas Sumatera Utara as a lecturer in 2009. He got his Bachelor and Master degrees from Universitas Gadjah Mada. Then he received a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering from Kanazawa University, Japan, in 2019. He has a research interest in Geographic Information Science, Disaster Mitigation, and Mixed Reality.

Studying in Japan has given him opportunities to manage and join some international conferences in Japan and Korea, take VR training by Forum8 in Japan, and take a short course in China. He cooperated with Japan's local disaster prevention community to manage the main evacuation shelter using mixed reality. In Indonesia, he has experience in supporting local government officers to utilize GIS in managing their territory.

He is a Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development (SPSD) community member and editor for the IRSPSD journal. He is also a member of the ICT Volunteer and has experience with the Indonesian and Korean governments for ICT volunteer projects.
