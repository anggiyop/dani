A Wise Alumni Never Misses the Tracer Study
Tracer Study will provide information about the results of career and life tracking of alumni after they graduate from the university. This is very useful for prospective students to know how successful alumni have been in their careers and how their university experience can help in achieving those goals. In addition, the Tracer Study also assists universities in improving the quality of education and improve programs that have been provided so that they can better prepare students to enter the world workforce. With the Tracer Study, the university can obtain valuable feedback from its alumni which can be used as evaluation and improvement material for the programs provided.
