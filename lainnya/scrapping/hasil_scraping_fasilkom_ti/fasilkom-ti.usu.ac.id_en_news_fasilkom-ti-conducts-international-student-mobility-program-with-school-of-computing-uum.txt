The Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (Fasilkom-TI) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has conducted an International Student Mobility Program with the School of Computing Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) on Monday, September 18, 2023 in the Seminar Room Building C Fasilkom-TI.

This program consists of several activities that support cooperation with UUM, namely the Joint Research Colloquium for S2 / S3 students and lecturers from UUM and USU in the Seminar Room Building C and D Fasilkom-TI. Furthermore, a public lecture with the material Through the HCI-UX Lenses: Designing for Persons with Disabilities presented by Prof. Madya Dr. Husniza binti Husni in the Seminar Room Building E.

Universal design is a design that is only made for all users, while inclusive design is a design that is customized and specific to a user. In designing applications, there are processes or stages that must be carried out, namely design thinking. Design thinking consists of five processes, namely, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
