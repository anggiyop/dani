Fasilkom-TI USU held a bootcamp for lab assistants to equalize the perception of Data Engineering and UI/UX courses, with presenters from Mamikos and Bank Sinarmas.

 

Medan, USU - The Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universitas Sumatera Utara (Fasilkom-TI USU) held a Perception Equalization Bootcamp for all teaching laboratory assistants in the field of Networking and Programming. This event specifically discussed courses related to Data Engineering and Project Management in the UI/UX field.

This event aims to identify the relationship between ITLG (Introduction to Technology and Logic Gates) and IKLC (Introduction to Knowledge and Logic Computing) courses related to Data Engineering and UI/UX. With this, it is expected that the laboratory assistants can find similarities and differences between the two courses. In addition, this event also aims to establish clear boundaries between ITLG and IKLC and encourage cooperation in the preparation of syllabi for both courses.

Honored Guests

1. Dani Setiawan, S.Kom., a Senior Data Engineer at Mamikos.com.

Furthermore, Mrs. Hayatunnufus S.Kom., M.Cs., as the Head of the Network Lab, gave a speech and appreciated the participants who participated in this event. The Head of Programming Lab, Mr. Herriyance S.T., M.Kom., also delivered his enthusiastic speech.

The event then continued with a group photo session as a sign of togetherness and cohesiveness.

Material Presentation

Dani Setiawan, S.Kom., presented material about Data Engineering. He explained the basic concepts of Data Engineering, its role in industry, and how laboratory assistants can integrate this knowledge into the courses they teach.

After that, Richard Valent Petrus Silalahi, S.Kom., presented material about Project Management in the UI/UX field. He discussed the importance of project management in UI/UX development and provided practical tips for laboratory assistants in managing projects in this field.

Minigames and Discussion

As an interlude, the event also presented interactive and fun minigames to break the ice and strengthen relationships between participants.

The highlight of the event was a perception-equalizing discussion by ITLG and IKLC on courses in Data Engineering and UI/UX. This discussion aimed to establish clear boundaries between ITLG and IKLC and facilitate collaboration in creating the course syllabus.

With this bootcamp, it is expected that the laboratory assistants of Fasilkom-TI USU can work more effectively and efficiently in teaching, and be able to develop a better syllabus that is relevant to industry needs.
