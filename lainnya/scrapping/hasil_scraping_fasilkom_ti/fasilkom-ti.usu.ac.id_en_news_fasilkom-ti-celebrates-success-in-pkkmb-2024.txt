The first day featured welcoming speeches from the PKKMB Chair of Fasilkom-TI, the Chair of the Student Government (Pema) of Fasilkom-TI, and an introduction to the faculty leadership by the Dean of Fasilkom-TI, Dr. Maya Silvi Lydia B.Sc., M.Sc.

This material aimed to build students' strong national awareness, responsibility as citizens, and readiness to contribute positively to the nation.

The second presentation of the day was on Core Values in the Digital Era, delivered by the Head of the Computer Science Program, Dr. Amalia, S.T., M.T. This session addressed cultural values, ethics, etiquette, and responsible use of social media.

The third presentation was by the Head of the Information Technology Program, Dedy Arisandi, S.T., M.Kom., on the topic of the Higher Education System in Indonesia.

The second day started with student registration and a group exercise session. It continued with a presentation on Higher Education in the Era of Industrial Revolution by the Secretary of the Information Technology Program, Ivan Jaya, S.Si., M.Kom.

This session focused on USU’s profile, core values, anthem and song, symbols and tagline, and available services and facilities. Students were also introduced to the Fasilkom-TI laboratories and taken on a campus tour to familiarize themselves with the faculty's environment and facilities.
