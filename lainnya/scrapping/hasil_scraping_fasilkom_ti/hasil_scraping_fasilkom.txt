The Undergraduate Program in Information Technology focuses on developing knowledge in Data Science and Intelligent Systems to produce excellent, professional graduates with global competitiveness. The program provides an education that equips students with academic competencies, technical skills, and an understanding of ethics and professional responsibility in applying information technology. The curriculum is designed to provide a strong foundation in information technology, data analysis, artificial intelligence, server and network security, information technology infrastructure management, and multidisciplinary aspects that support the development of data-driven computing solutions. Students are also equipped with teamwork skills, effective communication, and the ability to adapt to technological advancements. In the research field, the study program encourages the development of data-driven and artificial intelligence-based innovations relevant to industry and societal needs. Additionally, the study program actively engages in community service activities by applying research findings to enhance information literacy and technology-based solutions.

Graduates of the Information Technology study program have competencies in systematically applying information technology theories and practices, developing data-driven computing solutions, fostering multidisciplinary collaboration, and building technology-based entrepreneurship.

The proposal for the establishment of the Undergraduate Program in Information Technology was submitted in early 2007 with the goal of adding one more study program within the computing discipline, in addition to the Undergraduate Program in Computer Science that had been established in 2002. However, at that time, in the nomenclature rules of the Directorate General of Higher Education (Dikti), the name Information Technology Study Program was not yet known. This study program was still confused with the name of the study program known at that time as the Informatics Study Program, which was actually another name for the Computer Science Study Program. After discussions with the Director General of Higher Education, a decree was finally issued for the establishment of the study program, but under the name of the Undergraduate Program in Software Engineering. Thus, the Undergraduate Program in Software Engineering was officially established in 2007. Through Dikti Decree No. 1629/D/T/2007 dated July 16, 2007. In the early days of its establishment, this study program was managed under the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of (FMIPA USU). At the end of 2007, the Decree of the Director General of Higher Education No. 163/KEP/DIKTI/2007, dated November 27, 2007, on the Structuring and Codification of Study Programs in Higher Education Institutions. The naming of undergraduate (S-1) computer study programs is as follows: 1. Informatics Engineering (S-1); 2. Computer Systems (S-1); and 3. Information Systems (S-1) In this naming system, it can be seen that there is no place for the Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science and Software Engineering. Therefore, USU took the policy to adjust the naming of these two study programs to become the Undergraduate Program in Information Systems and the Undergraduate (S-1) Program in Informatics Engineering.

However, the naming system proposed by the Director General of Higher Education received challenges from various higher education institutions, especially those with computer study programs, due to the controversy that arose because many study programs were not accommodated in the new naming system. Asosiasi Perguruan Tinggi Informatika dan Komputer (APTIKOM or the Association of Informatics and Computer Higher Education Institutions) finally resolved this issue by proposing a system of naming and structuring study programs in the field of Informatics and Computers. The result was the Circular Letter of the Director General of Higher Education No. 1030/D/T/2010 on the Structuring of Nomenclature for Psychology, Communication, Computer, and Landscape Study Programs.

Virtual Tour of Tjong A Fie Mansion with Gamification as A Medium for History Learning

Thumbnail Virtual Tour of Tjong A Fie Mansion with Gamification as A Medium for History Learning

In this research, VR technology is used for digital preservation and conservation of one of the Medan historical heritages, Tjong A Fie Mansion

The rapid development of technology at the present time has resulted decreasing in the national community’s concern for the historical and cultural heritage that exists in Indonesia. This is also because of the publication media and the methods of historical introduction that are less attractive and interactive. Nowadays, visualization and simulation technology through Virtual Reality (VR) has developed greatly that VR is widely used and applied in various science field. So far, many historical buildings reconstruction that have been made into 2D format as well as 360° video views. However, in terms of visualization details and immersive experiences, user interactions in VR environment are limited. In this research, VR technology is used for digital preservation and conservation of one of the Medan historical heritages, Tjong A Fie Mansion. The application is built with Virtual Tour concept to provide detailed and interactive information about a location. The building model reconstructed into 3D allows exploration inside the building to provide an immersive experience to the user. Virtual Tour Tjong A Fie Mansion application’s trial was carried out to 10 random people and data collection was carried out by filling out the provided questionnaire. The questionnaire results obtained value of 83,6% which states this application run well, interesting, and interactive.

The Undergraduate Program in Information Technology focuses on developing knowledge in Data Science and Intelligent Systems to produce excellent, professional graduates with global competitiveness. The program provides an education that equips students with academic competencies, technical skills, and an understanding of ethics and professional responsibility in applying information technology. The curriculum is designed to provide a strong foundation in information technology, data analysis, artificial intelligence, server and network security, information technology infrastructure management, and multidisciplinary aspects that support the development of data-driven computing solutions. Students are also equipped with teamwork skills, effective communication, and the ability to adapt to technological advancements. In the research field, the study program encourages the development of data-driven and artificial intelligence-based innovations relevant to industry and societal needs. Additionally, the study program actively engages in community service activities by applying research findings to enhance information literacy and technology-based solutions.

Graduates of the Information Technology study program have competencies in systematically applying information technology theories and practices, developing data-driven computing solutions, fostering multidisciplinary collaboration, and building technology-based entrepreneurship.

The proposal for the establishment of the Undergraduate Program in Information Technology was submitted in early 2007 with the goal of adding one more study program within the computing discipline, in addition to the Undergraduate Program in Computer Science that had been established in 2002. However, at that time, in the nomenclature rules of the Directorate General of Higher Education (Dikti), the name Information Technology Study Program was not yet known. This study program was still confused with the name of the study program known at that time as the Informatics Study Program, which was actually another name for the Computer Science Study Program. After discussions with the Director General of Higher Education, a decree was finally issued for the establishment of the study program, but under the name of the Undergraduate Program in Software Engineering. Thus, the Undergraduate Program in Software Engineering was officially established in 2007. Through Dikti Decree No. 1629/D/T/2007 dated July 16, 2007. In the early days of its establishment, this study program was managed under the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of (FMIPA USU). At the end of 2007, the Decree of the Director General of Higher Education No. 163/KEP/DIKTI/2007, dated November 27, 2007, on the Structuring and Codification of Study Programs in Higher Education Institutions. The naming of undergraduate (S-1) computer study programs is as follows: 1. Informatics Engineering (S-1); 2. Computer Systems (S-1); and 3. Information Systems (S-1) In this naming system, it can be seen that there is no place for the Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science and Software Engineering. Therefore, USU took the policy to adjust the naming of these two study programs to become the Undergraduate Program in Information Systems and the Undergraduate (S-1) Program in Informatics Engineering.

However, the naming system proposed by the Director General of Higher Education received challenges from various higher education institutions, especially those with computer study programs, due to the controversy that arose because many study programs were not accommodated in the new naming system. Asosiasi Perguruan Tinggi Informatika dan Komputer (APTIKOM or the Association of Informatics and Computer Higher Education Institutions) finally resolved this issue by proposing a system of naming and structuring study programs in the field of Informatics and Computers. The result was the Circular Letter of the Director General of Higher Education No. 1030/D/T/2010 on the Structuring of Nomenclature for Psychology, Communication, Computer, and Landscape Study Programs.

Selain itu, penjelasan terkait risiko-risiko yang berkaitan dengan pengurusan ternakan tradisional dan bagaimana ia mempengaruhi keselamatan makanan. Diperlukan penyelesaian canggih untuk menangani cabaran dalam pengurusan ternakan tradisional salah satunya adalah Artificial Intelligence (AI) dan Peternakan Ternak Presisi. Dengan AI, kita dapat merevolusi peternakan dengan memungkinkan pemodelan prediktif, deteksi penyakit, dan pemberian pakan yang presisi. Penelitian ini, menggunakan pengaplikasian AI dan Smart Herd Management. Terdapat tiga projek dalam penelitian ini yaitu, identifikasi kerbau melalui citra moncong, estimasi berat badan kambing surti dan pengenalan wajah kambing.

Keynote speech kedua dibawakan oleh Prof Dr. Imas Sukaesih Sitanggang S.Si, M.Kom., dari Ilmu Komputer Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB) dan dimoderatori oleh Dr. Mohammad Andri Budiman, S.T., M.Comp.Sc., M.E.M. Ia menjelaskan tentang penelitiannya yang berjudul “Sistem Patroli Pencegahan Kebakaran Hutan dan Lahan di Indonesia”. Dalam penelitiannya, ia membuat Sistem Informasi Patroli Pencegahan Kebakaran Hutan dan Lahan (SIPP Karhutla) - Sistem Informasi Patroli SMART. Sistem ini dibuat dengan berbasis website dan mobile. Pengguna untuk aplikasi mobile adalah tim patroli pencegahan kebakaran dan lahan. Aplikasi mobile dibuat mudah untuk digunakan, mengelola 88 parameter patroli yang dikumpulkan dari lapangan, mengambil data lokasi dan cuaca secara otomatis, bekerja dengan atau tanpa koneksi internet, data hotspot waktu nyata dari Sipongi+ dan kamus istilah patroli. Sistem berbasis website digunakan oleh administrator dan kepala operasional daerah, administrator dan kepala pengendalian perubahan iklim dan kebakaran hutan dan lahan KLHK, koordinator wilayah, dan administrator direktorat pengendalian kebakaran hutan dan lahan.

Keynote speech ketiga dibawakan oleh Assoc. Prof Dr. Amalia S.T., M.T., dan dimoderatori oleh Dr. T Henny Harumi. Pada keynote speech ini, ia memaparkan penelitiannya yang berjudul “Mengurangi Bias dan Ketidakkonsistenan Penilaian dengan Penilaian Jawaban Singkat Otomatis Berbasis BERT untuk Bahasa Indonesia”. Dalam pemaparannya, ia menjelaskan tentang penilaian esai yang mendorong pembelajaran lebih mendalam, pemikiran kritis, dan pengembangan keterampilan penting yang berharga di luar ruang kelas. Namun, penilaian esai secara manual menimbulkan tantangan karena respons siswa yang beragam, kelemahan subjektivitas, ketidakkonsistenan, efisiensi, dan skalabilitas. Selain itu, penilaian manual juga memakan waktu dan rentan terhadap kesalahan manusia, terutama ketika melibatkan banyak penilai. Oleh karena itu, dibuatlah penilaian jawaban singkat dengan menggunakan BERT dan dataset SQuAD. BERT adalah model bahasa dengan arsitektur Transformer, yang berfokus pada Mekanisme Perhatian. Hasil dari penelitian ini adalah model mencapai akurasi penilaian sebesar 91%. Penelitian ini menyoroti keampuhan sistem berbasis BERT dalam meningkatkan kesetaraan dan presisi.

Tim AR Card Techtonic yang merupakan kolaborasi Fakultas Ilmu Komputer dan Teknologi Informasi (Fasilkom-TI) dan Fakultas Teknik (USU) berhasil meraih juara kedua dalam kompetisi produk inovasi pengabdian kepada masyarakat non PIMNAS ke-36 yang diselenggarakan pada tanggal 27-30 November 2023 di Universitas Padjajaran, Bandung.

Tim AR Card Techtonic yang merupakan kolaborasi Fakultas Ilmu Komputer dan Teknologi Informasi (Fasilkom-TI) dan Fakultas Teknik (USU) berhasil meraih juara kedua dalam kompetisi produk inovasi pengabdian kepada masyarakat non PIMNAS ke-36 yang diselenggarakan pada tanggal 27-30 November 2023 di Universitas Padjajaran, Bandung.

Kompetisi non-Pimnas merupakan kompetisi yang dapat diikuti oleh seluruh peserta Program Kreativitas Mahasiswa (PKM) yang tidak dipanggil dalam ajang Pimnas ke-36. Kompetisi non-Pimnas terbagi menjadi tiga kategori lomba, yaitu Produk/karya Teknologi, Kewirausahaan, dan Pengabdian kepada Masyarakat. Tim AR Card Techtonic mengikuti kategori lomba pengabdian masyarakat.

Tim AR Card Techtonic beranggotakan satu orang mahasiswa Teknik Informatika, Donny Adithya, dan empat orang mahasiswa Teknik Sipil, Siti Maulida Hasni, Annisa Tanurin Nasution, Luthfiah Khairunnisa, M Devin Alfalah Rambe. Tim ini didampingi oleh dosen Teknik Sipil, Dr. Rahmi Karolina, S.T., M.T., IPM.

AR Card Techtonic merupakan mitigasi bencana gempa bumi dalam membentuk kesiapsiagaan siswa sekolah dasar dengan media kartu 3D Augmented Reality (AR). Latar belakang dibuatnya AR Card Techtonic adalah kurangnya ketidaktahuan anak-anak untuk menyelamatkan diri saat terjadi gempa bumi, terbukti dari data bahwa setiap tahunnya diperkirakan sekitar 66 juta anak di seluruh dunia terkena dampak bencana gempa bumi.

Setelah produk selesai dibuat, Tim AR Card Techtonic mengimplementasikannya bersama mitra mereka, SDIT Siti Hajar, dengan cara menjelaskan penggunaan produk, melakukan Training of Trainers (ToT) kepada guru kelas, mempraktekkan penggunaan AR card, dan melakukan simulasi gempa bumi.

Dalam membuktikan keefektifan produk, Tim AR Card Techtonic mengajukan beberapa survei dari pertanyaan kepada guru dan siswa sekolah dasar mengenai media ular tangga dan media kartu AR Card Techtonic. Dapat disimpulkan bahwa AR Card Techtonic mampu meningkatkan kesadaran dan kesiapsiagaan kepada siswa sekolah dasar dalam menciptakan kemandirian mitigasi. Selain itu, program ini dapat mewujudkan inovasi pembelajaran yang menyenangkan dan edukatif.

Sebagai program studi yang telah terakreditasi unggul dan berdiri sejak tahun 2001, Program Sarjana Ilmu Komputer (USU) telah menghasilkan sejumlah mahasiswa berprestasi dan menciptakan para ahli komputer yang berkualitas dan tersebar di seluruh Indonesia. Program ini bertujuan mengajarkan ilmu mengenai komputasi, pengelolaan perangkat keras, dan pengembangan perangkat lunak komputer.

Dibimbing oleh individu-individu ahli di bidang teknologi informasi yang memiliki sertifikat pengajaran nasional, dan didukung oleh kurikulum terpadu, kami berkomitmen kuat untuk memberikan pendidikan dan pengalaman belajar yang interaktif kepada mahasiswa kami, dengan harapan mereka dapat menjadi yang terbaik dalam bidang teknologi informasi, kompeten, dan mampu bersaing pada era digitalisasi, baik dalam skala nasional maupun internasional. Lulusan program kami memiliki peluang karir yang luas di berbagai bidang digital, seperti insinyur perangkat lunak, desainer web, konsultan teknologi informasi, dan masih banyak lagi.

Fakultas Ilmu Komputer dan Teknologi Informasi (Fasilkom-TI) dibentuk pada tanggal 6 September 2011 dengan diterbitkannya Surat Keputusan Rektor USU Nomor 2360/UN5.1.R/SK/PRS/2011. Pembentukan Fasilkom-TI USU mempunyai sejarah yang cukup panjang dan melibatkan banyak pihak. Jika dihitung sejak dikeluarkannya izin pembukaan Program Studi Ilmu Komputer oleh Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Republik Indonesia tanggal 22 November 2001 sampai terbentuknya Fakultas, waktu yang dibutuhkan adalah sepuluh tahun. Program studi yang pertama kali terbentuk adalah Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer di bawah naungan FMIPA USU. Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer berdiri sesuai dengan Surat Keputusan Ditjen Dikti Nomor 3551/D/T/2001 tanggal 22 November 2001 tentang izin penyelenggaraan Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer.

Pada akhir tahun 2007, Ditjen Dikti mengeluarkan Surat Keputusan tentang Penataan dan Kodifikasi Program Studi pada Perguruan Tinggi Nomor 163/KEP/DIKTI/2007 tertanggal 27 November 2007 yang antara lain mengatur penamaan program studi S-1 bidang komputer sebagai berikut: Teknik Informatika S-1, Sistem Komputer S-1, dan Sistem Informasi S-1. Tetapi penamaan ini kemudian mengalami penyempurnaan dengan keluarnya Surat Edaran Ditjen Dikti Nomor 1030/D/T/2010. Dengan keluarnya Surat Edaran Ditjen Dikti tersebut, perguruan tinggi penyelenggara bidang komputer dan informatika diberi kesempatan untuk menata ulang penamaan program studi yang dikelolanya. dengan demikian menetapkan kembali nama untuk kedua program studinya menjadi Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer dan Program Studi S-1 Teknologi Informasi.

Program Studi S-1 Teknologi Informasi berfokus pada pengembangan keilmuan di bidang Data Science dan Intelligent System untuk menghasilkan lulusan yang unggul dan profesional dengan daya saing global. Program studi menyelenggarakan pendidikan yang membekali mahasiswa dengan kompetensi akademik, keterampilan teknis, serta pemahaman etika dan tanggung jawab profesional dalam penerapan teknologi informasi. Kurikulum dirancang untuk memberikan dasar yang kuat dalam teknologi informasi, analisis data, kecerdasan buatan, keamanan server dan jaringan, pengelolaan infrastruktur teknologi informasi, serta aspek multi disiplin yang mendukung pengembangan solusi komputasi berbasis data. Mahasiswa juga dibekali dengan keterampilan kerja sama tim, komunikasi efektif, dan adaptasi terhadap perkembangan teknologi. Dalam bidang penelitian, program studi mendorong pengembangan inovasi berbasis data dan kecerdasan buatan yang relevan dengan kebutuhan industri dan masyarakat. Selain itu, program studi aktif dalam kegiatan pengabdian kepada masyarakat melalui penerapan hasil riset untuk meningkatkan literasi informasi dan solusi berbasis teknologi.

Lulusan program studi Teknologi Informasi memiliki kompetensi dalam menerapkan teori dan praktik teknologi informasi secara sistematis, mengembangkan solusi komputasi berbasis data, menjalin kolaborasi multidisiplin, serta membangun kewirausahaan berbasis teknologi informasi.

Proposal pendirian Program Studi (S-1) Teknologi Informasi diajukan pada awal tahun 2007 dengan tujuan untuk menambah satu program studi lagi yang berada di lingkungan disiplin komputasi, di samping Program Studi Ilmu Komputer (S-1) yang telah didirikan sebelumnya pada tahun 2002. Namun, pada masa itu, dalam aturan nomenklatur Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi (Dikti) nama Program Studi Teknologi Informasi belum dikenal. Program studi ini masih dikacaukan dengan nama program studi yang dikenal pada masa itu dengan nama Program Studi Teknik Informatika (Informatics), yang sebenarnya adalah nama lain dari Program Studi Ilmu Komputer (Computer Science). Setelah melalui diskusi dengan pihak Dirjen Dikti, akhirnya keluarlah surat keputusan pendirian program studi dimaksud, tetapi dengan nama Program Studi Teknik Perangkat Lunak Strata-1 (S-1). Dengan demikian, Program Studi Teknik Perangkat Lunak (S-1) secara resmi didirikan pada tahun 2007. Melalui SK Dikti No. 1629/D/T/2007 tanggal 16 Juli 2007. Pada masa awal pembukaannya, program studi ini dikelola di bawah Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam (FMIPA USU). Pada tahun 2007 akhir, keluarlah Surat Keputusan Dirjen Dikti No. 163/KEP/DIKTI/2007 tertanggal 27 November 2007 tentang Penataan dan Kodifikasi Program Studi pada Perguruan Tinggi. Penamaan program studi (S-1) bidang komputer adalah sebagai berikut: 1. Teknik Informatika (S-1); 2. Sistem Komputer (S-1); dan 3. Sistem Informasi (S-1) Dalam sistem penamaan ini, terlihat bahwa tidak ada tempat untuk Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer dan Teknik Perangkat Lunak. Oleh karena itu, USU mengambil kebijakan untuk menyesuaikan penamaan kedua program studi ini menjadi S-1 Sistem Informasi dan S-1 Teknik Informatika.

Namun, sistem penamaan yang diajukan oleh Dirjen DIKTI tersebut mendapat tantangan dari berbagai perguruan tinggi, khususnya yang memiliki program studi bidang komputer disebabkan kontroversi yang timbul karena banyaknya program studi yang tidak terakomodasi dalam sistem penamaan yang baru tersebut. Asosiasi Perguruan Tinggi Informatika dan Komputer (APTIKOM) akhirnya ikut menyelesaikan persoalan ini dengan mengajukan sistem penamaan dan penataan program studi bidang informatika dan komputer. Hasilnya adalah Surat Edaran Dirjen DIKTI No. 1030/D/T/2010 tentang Penataan Nomenklatur Program Studi Psikologi, Komunikasi, Komputer, dan Lanskap.

Tur Virtual Tjong A Fie Mansion dengan Gamifikasi sebagai Media Pembelajaran Sejarah

Thumbnail Tur Virtual Tjong A Fie Mansion dengan Gamifikasi sebagai Media Pembelajaran Sejarah

Dalam penelitian ini, teknologi VR digunakan untuk preservasi dan konservasi digital salah satu peninggalan sejarah Medan, Tjong A Fie Mansion

Pesatnya perkembangan teknologi pada saat ini mengakibatkan menurunnya kepedulian masyarakat nasional terhadap peninggalan sejarah dan budaya yang ada di Indonesia. Hal ini juga disebabkan oleh media publikasi dan metode pengenalan sejarah yang kurang menarik dan interaktif. Saat ini, teknologi visualisasi dan simulasi melalui Virtual Reality (VR) telah berkembang pesat sehingga VR banyak digunakan dan diaplikasikan dalam berbagai bidang ilmu pengetahuan. Selama ini banyak rekonstruksi bangunan bersejarah yang telah dibuat dalam bentuk 2D maupun tampilan video 360°. Namun, dari segi detail visualisasi dan pengalaman imersif, interaksi pengguna dalam lingkungan VR masih terbatas. Pada penelitian ini, teknologi VR digunakan untuk preservasi dan konservasi digital salah satu peninggalan sejarah di Medan, Tjong A Fie Mansion. Aplikasi ini dibangun dengan konsep Virtual Tour untuk memberikan informasi secara detail dan interaktif mengenai suatu lokasi. Model bangunan yang direkonstruksi ke dalam bentuk 3D memungkinkan eksplorasi di dalam bangunan untuk memberikan pengalaman yang imersif kepada pengguna. Uji coba aplikasi Virtual Tour Tjong A Fie Mansion dilakukan kepada 10 orang secara acak dan pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan mengisi kuesioner yang telah disediakan. Hasil kuesioner didapatkan nilai 83,6% yang menyatakan aplikasi ini berjalan dengan baik, menarik, dan interaktif.

Sebagai program studi yang telah terakreditasi unggul dan berdiri sejak tahun 2001, Program Sarjana Ilmu Komputer (USU) telah menghasilkan sejumlah mahasiswa berprestasi dan menciptakan para ahli komputer yang berkualitas dan tersebar di seluruh Indonesia. Program ini bertujuan mengajarkan ilmu mengenai komputasi, pengelolaan perangkat keras, dan pengembangan perangkat lunak komputer.

Dibimbing oleh individu-individu ahli di bidang teknologi informasi yang memiliki sertifikat pengajaran nasional, dan didukung oleh kurikulum terpadu, kami berkomitmen kuat untuk memberikan pendidikan dan pengalaman belajar yang interaktif kepada mahasiswa kami, dengan harapan mereka dapat menjadi yang terbaik dalam bidang teknologi informasi, kompeten, dan mampu bersaing pada era digitalisasi, baik dalam skala nasional maupun internasional. Lulusan program kami memiliki peluang karir yang luas di berbagai bidang digital, seperti insinyur perangkat lunak, desainer web, konsultan teknologi informasi, dan masih banyak lagi.

Fakultas Ilmu Komputer dan Teknologi Informasi (Fasilkom-TI) dibentuk pada tanggal 6 September 2011 dengan diterbitkannya Surat Keputusan Rektor USU Nomor 2360/UN5.1.R/SK/PRS/2011. Pembentukan Fasilkom-TI USU mempunyai sejarah yang cukup panjang dan melibatkan banyak pihak. Jika dihitung sejak dikeluarkannya izin pembukaan Program Studi Ilmu Komputer oleh Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Republik Indonesia tanggal 22 November 2001 sampai terbentuknya Fakultas, waktu yang dibutuhkan adalah sepuluh tahun. Program studi yang pertama kali terbentuk adalah Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer di bawah naungan FMIPA USU. Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer berdiri sesuai dengan Surat Keputusan Ditjen Dikti Nomor 3551/D/T/2001 tanggal 22 November 2001 tentang izin penyelenggaraan Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer.

Pada akhir tahun 2007, Ditjen Dikti mengeluarkan Surat Keputusan tentang Penataan dan Kodifikasi Program Studi pada Perguruan Tinggi Nomor 163/KEP/DIKTI/2007 tertanggal 27 November 2007 yang antara lain mengatur penamaan program studi S-1 bidang komputer sebagai berikut: Teknik Informatika S-1, Sistem Komputer S-1, dan Sistem Informasi S-1. Tetapi penamaan ini kemudian mengalami penyempurnaan dengan keluarnya Surat Edaran Ditjen Dikti Nomor 1030/D/T/2010. Dengan keluarnya Surat Edaran Ditjen Dikti tersebut, perguruan tinggi penyelenggara bidang komputer dan informatika diberi kesempatan untuk menata ulang penamaan program studi yang dikelolanya. dengan demikian menetapkan kembali nama untuk kedua program studinya menjadi Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer dan Program Studi S-1 Teknologi Informasi.

Program Studi S-1 Teknologi Informasi berfokus pada pengembangan keilmuan di bidang Data Science dan Intelligent System untuk menghasilkan lulusan yang unggul dan profesional dengan daya saing global. Program studi menyelenggarakan pendidikan yang membekali mahasiswa dengan kompetensi akademik, keterampilan teknis, serta pemahaman etika dan tanggung jawab profesional dalam penerapan teknologi informasi. Kurikulum dirancang untuk memberikan dasar yang kuat dalam teknologi informasi, analisis data, kecerdasan buatan, keamanan server dan jaringan, pengelolaan infrastruktur teknologi informasi, serta aspek multi disiplin yang mendukung pengembangan solusi komputasi berbasis data. Mahasiswa juga dibekali dengan keterampilan kerja sama tim, komunikasi efektif, dan adaptasi terhadap perkembangan teknologi. Dalam bidang penelitian, program studi mendorong pengembangan inovasi berbasis data dan kecerdasan buatan yang relevan dengan kebutuhan industri dan masyarakat. Selain itu, program studi aktif dalam kegiatan pengabdian kepada masyarakat melalui penerapan hasil riset untuk meningkatkan literasi informasi dan solusi berbasis teknologi.

Lulusan program studi Teknologi Informasi memiliki kompetensi dalam menerapkan teori dan praktik teknologi informasi secara sistematis, mengembangkan solusi komputasi berbasis data, menjalin kolaborasi multidisiplin, serta membangun kewirausahaan berbasis teknologi informasi.

Proposal pendirian Program Studi (S-1) Teknologi Informasi diajukan pada awal tahun 2007 dengan tujuan untuk menambah satu program studi lagi yang berada di lingkungan disiplin komputasi, di samping Program Studi Ilmu Komputer (S-1) yang telah didirikan sebelumnya pada tahun 2002. Namun, pada masa itu, dalam aturan nomenklatur Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi (Dikti) nama Program Studi Teknologi Informasi belum dikenal. Program studi ini masih dikacaukan dengan nama program studi yang dikenal pada masa itu dengan nama Program Studi Teknik Informatika (Informatics), yang sebenarnya adalah nama lain dari Program Studi Ilmu Komputer (Computer Science). Setelah melalui diskusi dengan pihak Dirjen Dikti, akhirnya keluarlah surat keputusan pendirian program studi dimaksud, tetapi dengan nama Program Studi Teknik Perangkat Lunak Strata-1 (S-1). Dengan demikian, Program Studi Teknik Perangkat Lunak (S-1) secara resmi didirikan pada tahun 2007. Melalui SK Dikti No. 1629/D/T/2007 tanggal 16 Juli 2007. Pada masa awal pembukaannya, program studi ini dikelola di bawah Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam (FMIPA USU). Pada tahun 2007 akhir, keluarlah Surat Keputusan Dirjen Dikti No. 163/KEP/DIKTI/2007 tertanggal 27 November 2007 tentang Penataan dan Kodifikasi Program Studi pada Perguruan Tinggi. Penamaan program studi (S-1) bidang komputer adalah sebagai berikut: 1. Teknik Informatika (S-1); 2. Sistem Komputer (S-1); dan 3. Sistem Informasi (S-1) Dalam sistem penamaan ini, terlihat bahwa tidak ada tempat untuk Program Studi S-1 Ilmu Komputer dan Teknik Perangkat Lunak. Oleh karena itu, USU mengambil kebijakan untuk menyesuaikan penamaan kedua program studi ini menjadi S-1 Sistem Informasi dan S-1 Teknik Informatika.

Namun, sistem penamaan yang diajukan oleh Dirjen DIKTI tersebut mendapat tantangan dari berbagai perguruan tinggi, khususnya yang memiliki program studi bidang komputer disebabkan kontroversi yang timbul karena banyaknya program studi yang tidak terakomodasi dalam sistem penamaan yang baru tersebut. Asosiasi Perguruan Tinggi Informatika dan Komputer (APTIKOM) akhirnya ikut menyelesaikan persoalan ini dengan mengajukan sistem penamaan dan penataan program studi bidang informatika dan komputer. Hasilnya adalah Surat Edaran Dirjen DIKTI No. 1030/D/T/2010 tentang Penataan Nomenklatur Program Studi Psikologi, Komunikasi, Komputer, dan Lanskap.
