In his remarks, the USU Rector said that one of the assessments of the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings in order to reach the Top 500 World Class University is the exchange of foreign students and lecturers at USU, so a visa is needed to come to Indonesia, especially USU. USU students also participate in student exchanges abroad, therefore collaboration with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights is required to make it easier to apply for passports.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) officially cooperates with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights (Kemenkumham). This is stated in a memorandum of understanding signed by USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si with the Head of the Regional Office of the Kemenkumham North Sumatra Drs. Imam Suyudi, Bc.I.P., S.H., M.H. The activity took place in the Rector's Audience Room, Central Administration Bureau Building, on Thursday (8/11/2022).

In his remarks, the USU Rector said that one of the assessments of the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings in order to reach the Top 500 World Class University is the exchange of foreign students and lecturers at USU, so a visa is needed to come to Indonesia, especially USU. USU students also participate in student exchanges abroad, therefore collaboration with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights is required to make it easier to apply for passports.

"One of the assessments of the QS World University Rankings is the exchange of International students and lecturers," he said.

With this collaboration, it will make it easier for lecturers to apply for patents or Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) for research or scientific product innovations that have just been discovered. And the Rector hopes that this collaboration will provide mutual benefits or positive things.

Head of the Regional Office of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of North Sumatra Drs. Imam Suyudi, Bc.I.P., S.H., M.H. conveyed that with this collaboration USU Law Faculty Lecturers could become members of the guidance and supervision of a notary at the level of the regional supervisory board and regional supervisor.

The Head of the Regional Office of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights said that with this collaboration, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights accepted USU students who would be interning at the Ministry of Law and Human Rights Office, and would also assist USU in immigration matters.

"The Ministry of Law and Human Rights will assist USU in terms of immigration and intellectual property rights," he said. (©ULC)
