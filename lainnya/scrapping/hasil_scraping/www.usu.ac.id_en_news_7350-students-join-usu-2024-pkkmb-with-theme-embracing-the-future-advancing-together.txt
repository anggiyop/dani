“It is important for you to first understand your goals and what you want to become after entering college. Think about how you will approach your studies,” said USU Rector.

USU PR—To kick off the new academic year, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held its Pengenalan Kehidupan Kampus Mahasiswa Baru (PKKMB) 2024 under the theme “Embracing The Future, Advancing Together.” On Tuesday (Aug. 13, 2024), 7,350 new students gathered at the Mini Stadium USU for the event, which ran for three days until Thursday (Aug. 15, 2024).

 

The theme “Embracing The Future, Advancing Together” is highly relevant given the future challenges and opportunities. In a rapidly evolving world characterized by advancements in technology, science, and social dynamics, students are encouraged to approach the future with openness to innovation, change, and progress.

 

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., opened the PKKMB with congratulations to the new students and accolades to those who achieved top scores in the SNBP, SNBT, and Mandiri selection processes. He also expressed pride in welcoming students from the far eastern region of Indonesia, specifically from Jayapura.

 

The Rector urged students to aim for excellence both academically and non-academically, on both local and international scales. He advised new students to identify their interests and talents that they wish to develop during their studies.

 

“It is important for you to first understand your goals and what you want to become after entering college. Think about how you will approach your studies,” he said.

 

Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi., Director of the USU Student Achievement and Alumni Relations Office, noted that USU supports its student organizations to encourage students to be proactive and enhance their skills. 

 

“We want students to be active in organizations and channels for their interests, which will improve their achievements and soft skills,” she said.

 

This year’s PKKMB featured vibrant performances, including traditional dances from North Sumatra by the UKM Tari Lentera Nataraja USU and an angklung performance by Psychestra Harmony from the USU Faculty of Psychology. The event also highlighted USU’s Green Campus initiative, which included environmentally friendly goodie bags, an action plan, and a zero-trash policy.

 

The Green Campus program aimed to raise awareness among new students about the importance of maintaining and caring for the campus environment. New students left the PKKMB 2024 event area clean and trash-free, adhering to the program’s guidelines.
