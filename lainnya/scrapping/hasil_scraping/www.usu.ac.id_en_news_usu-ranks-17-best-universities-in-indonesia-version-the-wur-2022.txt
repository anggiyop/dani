The University of North Sumatra (USU) continues to make brilliant achievements under the leadership of USU Chancellor Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. Most recently, USU was ranked as the 17th best university in Indonesia according to the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Ranking (WUR) 2022.

THE WUR is a ranking of world universities using five indicators, namely teaching, research, citations, income and international outlook. There are 1,600 universities from 95 countries on the list.

Responding to this achievement, USU Chancellor Dr. Muryanto Amin, who was interviewed on Sunday (9/5/2021) said that USU’s entry in international rankings was an indicator of success in the campus internationalization program.

“Alhamdulillah, we are grateful that USU is ranked 17th. Surely, this ranking gives strong motivation for USU’s order to be better,” he said.

He also thanked USU’s lecturers and staff for supporting and working together in the programs he had launched.

“Let’s make USU’s ranking a momentum for transformation for improvement in all lines. We have to be sure that we can do all the improvements by working optimally and collaborating,” he said.

USU itself continues to experience significant changes under the command of US Chancellor Dr. Muryanto Amin, who has not even been in charge for a year. USU’s achievements at the international and national levels so far indicate that USU is moving progressively in a better direction.

THE WUR 2022 itself places USU in 17th positions as the best university in Indonesia with strict assessment indicators. UI ranks first, followed by ITB, UPI and Unair.(©ULC)
