One of the USU SPIRIT Club members, Fiora Patricia Br Ginting, showed extraordinary achievements by winning the National Taekwondo Championship (Indonesia). The victory obtained was 2nd place in the National Championship "Indonesia Taekwondo Championship," the Cup of the Coordinating Minister for the Economy (Mr. Airlangga Hartarto), and the Cup of the Chairperson of Pengprov T.I North Sumatra (Mr. Musa Rajekshah). This championship was held on June 01-04, 2023, at the DISPORASU Multipurpose Sports Building, Jl. Willem Iskandar (Jl.Pancing), Medan, Indonesia."

The competition was attended by more than 100 participants from all regions in Indonesia, from Aceh to Papua. This brings pride to the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and USU SPIRIT CLUB, where Fiora is a very active member of USU SPIRIT Club and a student of the Faculty of Economics, Accounting Department, Class of 2021.

The sport of Taekwondo has caused this art to develop in many different forms. Like many other martial arts, Taekwondo combines martial arts fighting techniques, philosophy, entertainment, and sports.

In a match, spinning, 45-degree, front, axe, and side kicks are the most widely used; kicks include jumping, spinning, passing, and dropkicks, often in combination. Taekwondo training also consists of a comprehensive system of punching and defense with the hands but generally does not emphasize wrestling techniques. This provides strenuous physical activity but offers more benefits, especially in burning energy. Burning enough energy can prevent metabolic diseases, including non-communicable diseases.

Congratulations to Fiora, and hopefully, other USU SPIRIT Club members will continue to excel.
