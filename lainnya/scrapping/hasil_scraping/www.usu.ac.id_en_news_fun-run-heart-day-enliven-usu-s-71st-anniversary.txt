USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M. Si., conveyed a positive message so participants could exercise, socialize, and share happiness in the Fun Run.

USU PR- To commemorate the 71st Anniversary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), a series of agendas were held to enliven it, namely the 5K Fun Run and social action, which became the highlight of the World Heart Day event. With the tagline 'Know Your Heart, Love Your Heart'. It took place in the courtyard of the USU’s Rector Administration Center Bureau on Thursday (28/09/2023).

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M. Si., conveyed a positive message so participants could exercise, socialize, and share happiness in the Fun Run.

"Because good health always goes hand in hand with happiness," said Prof. Muryanto.

World Heart Day, commemorated on September 29, 2023, is an annual occasion to raise awareness of the importance of heart health. For this reason, the North Sumatra branch of the Indonesian Association of Cardiovascular Specialist Doctors (PERKI) has held a series of activities throughout September.

Chairman of the World Health Day 2023 committee, PERKI Sumut, dr. M Desfrianda Pane, Sp. JP explained the series of events that had taken place, including education to the general public through various media, such as radio, social media, and TVRI. The event's peak is held simultaneously with the USU's 71st Anniversary commemoration.

"We make the series of events in the form of pre-event activities, where the main activity is to provide education to the general public," explained Dr. M Desfrianda.

The event has been held simultaneously in 42 PERKI branches, with the main focus this year being to socialize a simple and effective method known as 'MENARI.' Furthermore, Dr. M Desfrianda Pane, Sp. JP explained that the MENARI method can feel one's pulse and detect heart rhythm disorders early.

"So if a heart condition is identified in oneself, the individual can immediately seek help. We have been actively working on this," said Dr. M Desfrianda.

Entire Indonesia has participated in efforts to spread awareness about 'MeNaRi' to the whole community, and these efforts have claimed a record from the Indonesian Museum of World Records (MURI).

"We must be serious to encourage the community to adopt healthy behaviors to avoid heart attacks," said Dr. Alwi.

Therefore, dr. Alwi Mujahit Hasibuan advised all Indonesian people to prioritize healthy behavior in their daily lives.

"Know your heart, love your heart!" said dr. Alwi
