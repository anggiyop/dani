Next year, Bank Sumut will open an internship quota for 50 students per semester. Thus, in one year Bank Sumut accepts 100 internship students from various universities in North Sumatra.

PR USU - Following up on the Merdeka Learning Independent Campus (MBKM) internship program between the Universitas Sumatera Utara and PT Bank Sumut, the two institutions held a meeting to discuss the technical implementation. The meeting took place in the Academic Senate Room, Central Administration Building, 3rd floor, USU Medan Campus, Thursday (10/14/2021).

During the meeting, several issues related to the implementation of internships carried out by USU students who had passed the selection were discussed, including the follow-up selection to be conducted in the coming semester. Previously, 11 USU students had been accepted into the MBKM internship program at Bank Sumut.

A number of technical problems surfaced in the meeting. However, both the expert staff of the USU Vice Rector I, Reni Asmara Ariga, SKp, MARS and the expert staff of the USU Vice Rector III, Siti Salmiah, drg. Sp.KGA, who on that occasion represented the Vice Rectors I and III, stated that this internship program will continue to be perfected by communicating intensely with partners. USU will also facilitate the conversion of internship scores by students.

On that occasion, the expert staff also asked the Bank of North Sumatra to clarify the rules and additional requirements for USU students who have passed the MBKM selection. The application deadline for the next interns is November 15-27, 2021. Meanwhile, Bank Sumut, represented by, among others, Bank Sumut HR Leader Subhan Pardosi, Training Center Leader Rusdi Siregar and USU KCP Head Thomas AC Tarigan, stated that regarding the MBKM selection process, Bank Sumut wanted students to be accepted for the MBKM activity, who already know enough about banking. The selection that is made does not need to be as strict as the selection for work entry, but students must be searched for in accordance with the work activities in the BUMD institution.

“We also hope that students who pass the selection will prioritize those who are in semester 5 and 7, so there will be continuity. Also, if possible, these students have taken research methodology courses, so that while doing internships, the students can also write about Bank of North Sumatra," Subhan said.

He also stated that next year Bank Sumut will open an internship quota for 50 students per semester. Thus, in one year Bank Sumut accepts 100 internship students from various universities in North Sumatra.

Also present on the occasion were a number of leaders including the Head of the Academic Bureau, the Head of the P2KM and Cooperation Bureau, the ranks of the Educational Service and Development Unit and several related heads. (©ULC)
