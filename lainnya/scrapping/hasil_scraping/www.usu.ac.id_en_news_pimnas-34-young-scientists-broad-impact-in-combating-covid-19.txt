"Young researchers can pursue COVID-19-related studies, contributing to the development of health technologies and international publications. These outputs can serve as policy recommendations for the government. Cooperation in addressing health issues requires a penta-helix collaboration involving academics, the government, civil society, businesses, and the media to create a healthy environment," he explained.

USU PR – The 34th National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS) in 2021, held at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), featured a public lecture as part of its agenda. Acting Head of the Research and Development Agency of the Indonesian Ministry of Health (Litbangkes Kemenkes), Dr. Drs. Nana Mulyana, M.Kes, served as the keynote speaker at the event, which took place in the USU Auditorium on Friday (29/10/2021).

The event was inaugurated by USU’s Vice Rector I and Chair of the 34th PIMNAS Organizing Committee, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A. In his opening remarks, Dr. Edy emphasized the importance of addressing the demographic bonus wisely.

"The demographic bonus can bring benefits but also challenges. We must continuously monitor and guide the quality of our youth. If managed well, this demographic bonus can serve as a golden bridge toward a developed Indonesia," said Dr. Edy.

In his presentation, Dr. Nana highlighted the significant role young scientists have played in preventing and managing COVID-19. Their impact has been instrumental in overcoming the pandemic. He noted that the younger generation tends to share a common vision, exhibit high trust, collaborate effectively, and enjoy strong management support.

"Young researchers can pursue COVID-19-related studies, contributing to the development of health technologies and international publications. These outputs can serve as policy recommendations for the government. Cooperation in addressing health issues requires a penta-helix collaboration involving academics, the government, civil society, businesses, and the media to create a healthy environment," he explained.

Dr. Nana also emphasized that crises present the best opportunities for change. The COVID-19 pandemic has altered human habits, with many activities now incorporating health protocols.

"COVID-19 has made health the number one priority. The public is now more aware of its importance. The pandemic has highlighted the need for resilience in the health sector and revealed systemic issues that must be addressed to enhance health capacity and resilience. Indonesia’s healthcare system is now ready for transformation, making this the right moment to act," he stated.

Dr. Nana pointed out persistent health challenges in Indonesia. Clean and healthy living practices have not yet become a cultural norm, and there remains a lack of awareness about health’s significance among the population.

"Indonesia's health ranking demands our collective attention. For example, Indonesia has the second-highest tuberculosis burden in the world. Furthermore, 73% of deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases, higher than Southeast Asia's average of 60%. Additionally, 39% of Indonesians aged 15 and above smoke—the highest rate among ASEAN countries," he noted.

To prepare for future crises, Dr. Nana stressed the need to strengthen Indonesia’s detection and response capabilities. This includes robust information systems, surveillance readiness, industrial capacity, logistics, and supply chain management.

"Given the lessons from COVID-19 and Indonesia's geographic vulnerability to disasters, a coordinated multisectoral approach is essential to enhance national and regional preparedness for future crises," Dr. Nana stated.

He reminded the audience of the critical role young people play in realizing a developed Indonesia. Simple actions by the younger generation can contribute significantly to building a better and higher-quality nation.

"Young people can be agents of change by raising awareness among the general public, especially those lacking nationalistic spirit. As social controllers, they can engage in actions based on clear and well-researched reasons," he added.

Moreover, young people can serve as moral forces by setting examples for their communities. They can also become future leaders, creating a pool of high-quality, visionary, and nationalistic leaders who will steer Indonesia toward progress.

"Students can use campuses, which are microcosms of the nation, as platforms for learning and practicing positive bureaucracy through available organizations," he stated.

The event also featured a poster competition open to the public at the USU Pancasila Building. The lecture was attended by students and faculty members from various USU departments. Dr. Inke Nadia Diniyanti Lubis, M.Ked(Ped), SpA, Ph.D., Vice Dean III of the Faculty of Health Sciences at USU, served as the moderator. The event concluded with a token of appreciation and a group photo session.
