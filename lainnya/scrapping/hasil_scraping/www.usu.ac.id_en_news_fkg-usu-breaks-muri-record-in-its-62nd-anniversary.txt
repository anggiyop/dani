As part of this extraordinary academic community, we all have a role and responsibility to ensure that the quality of education at Universitas Sumatera Utara remains at the forefront," said Prof. Poppy

USU PR- The Faculty of Dentistry (FKG) at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) achieved a MURI record during its 62nd anniversary celebration. The theme for this anniversary was "Together We Become Strong: Faculty of Dentistry and The Alumni to be Advancing Trendsetters in the Field," held at FKG USU on Sunday (11/12/2023).

The Dies Natalis of the Faculty of Dentistry USU began with the beating of nine gongs. Carrying the theme "Together We Become Strong" intends to unite for the progress of FKG. The event became even more lively by organizing a jaw exercise that involved 1346 participants and successfully broke the Indonesian Museum of Records (MURI) record for the highest number of participants.

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., as the Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation, highly appreciated the implementation of the event. The theme reflects the spirit to continue growing, innovating, and making a positive impact in dentistry.

"As part of this extraordinary academic community, we all have a role and responsibility to ensure that the quality of education at Universitas Sumatera Utara remains at the forefront," said Prof. Poppy.

Vice Rector III added that she hopes FKG USU will mature further in managing and developing all the potential of the faculty and producing outstanding graduates who can make significant contributions to society.

"It also becomes one of the support systems in realizing the internationalization program promoted by Universitas Sumatera Utara," she added.

Dr. drg. Essie Octiara, Sp. KGA., as the Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry USU, stated that in the future, the faculty will become more progressive, united, and responsible, as the theme carried this year. She also appreciated the lecturers, departments, and study programs that have achieved outstanding results.

"With the intention that it will motivate other lecturers, departments, and study programs to imitate in the next year," said Dr. drg. Essie.

Furthermore, drg. Siti Wahyuni, M.DSc., the Chair of the Dies Natalis Committee at FKG USU, mentioned that the jaw exercise aims to alleviate the pain often experienced by the general public.

"If we open our mouths and hear a clicking sound, the jaw is already problematic. So, our jaw exercise can eliminate pain in the jaw joint. It's very inexpensive and easy," explained dr. Siti.

The Dies Natalis of FKG USU 2023 was not only enlivened by jaw exercises but also featured other activities such as Community Service, Dentist Infinity with Sports Competitions, Alumni Gatherings, Alumni Performances, Competitions, and a bazaar
