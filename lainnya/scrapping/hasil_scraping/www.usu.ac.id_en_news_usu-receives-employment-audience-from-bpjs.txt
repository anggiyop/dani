"According to the USU Rector, students who have completed internships at the BPJS office can be deemed high-performing, and there are prospects for employment at the BPJS office after graduation."

USU PR - Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), accompanied by Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance of USU, Muhammad Arifin Nasution S.Sos., M.Si., received an audience from the Social Security Organizing Agency (BPJS) Employment in the North Sumatra Region (Sumbagut), Monday (20/02/2023) in the USU Administrative Center Bureau Building Audience Room.

The USU chancellor stated that students who have participated in internships at the BPJS office could be regarded as high-performing students, and there are prospects for employment at the BPJS office after graduation.

"It is also feasible for permanent workers who are not civil servants (PNS) to be registered with the BPJS employment so that they would receive a pension fund when they retire," the Rector explained.

In line with this, USU Vice Chancellor II said that there are guidelines for internships so that internships can run as desired, such as the rules for the time of internship, which will be carried out for one semester or the equivalent of 16 meetings and other regulations.

"Students who complete internships must receive useful advantages when they graduate and seek employment," he said.

During the same event, the Deputy Director of BPJS Employment for the Sumbagut Region, Henky Rhosidien, stated that these audiences invited the USU academic community to protect workers and students who studied in Medan and could use this social security in critical situations.

"Moreover, the advantages of this Employment BPJS state that if the family's breadwinner is lost, the child who is presently enrolled in school will be eligible for a scholarship, ranging from Kindergarten (TK) to Bachelor (S1)," he explained. (Bambang Riyanto)
