This is focused on young people to prevent various diseases such as obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other non-communicable diseases. This SPIRIT Project activity involves European countries, namely the University of Nicosia (Cyprus), the University of Lisbon (Portugal), and the University Politecnica de Valencia (Spain); Asian countries namely ISBR Business School (India), Lovely Professional University (India), Bharati Vidyapeeth deemed to be University (India), University of Peradeniya (Sri Lanka), Sabaragamuwa University (Sri Lanka), University of North Sumatra (Indonesia), Agricultural Institute Bogor (Indonesia), Syah Kuala University (Indonesia).

 

In the future, the sustainability of the SPIRIT Project needs to be maintained by developing the SPIRIT Club, which will metamorphose into the Global SPIRIT Club Network (GSCN). In the future, GSCN will be developed in each country to develop the SPIRIT Project so that its three-year role will produce results in supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and preventing non-communicable diseases.
