"MTQ is an Islamic religious festival in Indonesia to glorify the Koran, participants compete to recite the Koran using qiraat, reading the Koran containing recitation, art and reading ethics. Of course this is related to Islamic religious education in universities," he explained.

USU PR - Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. dr. M. Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), SpOG(K) attended the opening of the 38th Musabaqah Tilawatil Qur'an (MTQ) at the North Sumatra Province level in 2022 which was centered on the North Sumatra State Islamic University (UIN) campus, Monday ( 21/03/2022). The festival, which lasts for a week from March 21-28, was opened by the Governor of North Sumatra, Edy Rahmayadi.
