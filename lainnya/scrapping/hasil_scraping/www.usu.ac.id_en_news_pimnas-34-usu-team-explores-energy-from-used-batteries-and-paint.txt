"Our research has achieved a very high efficiency of 19.64%, which is significantly better than previous studies," Nikayati explained.

USU PR – A student team from Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) participating in the 34th National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS) has conducted research to create an innovative solution for generating electricity using paint and used batteries.

Their project, titled “Solar Paint: Paint Integrated with Perovskite/TiO2 from Used Batteries Using Spray Coating Method as a Renewable Energy Solution,” comprises members from FMIPA, including Nikayati, Ishmah Ulya, Siti Nurhadijah, Gusti Vita Utami, and Irfan Gunawan Siregar from the Faculty of Engineering.

Speaking with USU Public Relations on Friday (29/10/2021), team leader Nikayati stated that solar paint capable of generating electricity has not yet been studied in Indonesia. However, similar research was conducted internationally in 2018, yielding an efficiency of only 4.13%.

Their research, which utilizes perovskite derived from used batteries, has demonstrated a much higher efficiency of 19.64%.

"Our research has achieved a very high efficiency of 19.64%, which is significantly better than previous studies," Nikayati explained.

The team chose to use used batteries as a source of perovskite because they remain underutilized despite their potential. A single used battery contains a substantial amount of PbO2 powder with a high purity level exceeding 95%.

Nikayati further explained that the team conducted literature studies on the spray coating method. This technique is easy to apply and ensures uniform thickness.

"This method offers numerous advantages in producing solar cell films," she noted.

During the judging process, the team received high praise from the panel, particularly for the innovation’s strengths. Their solar paint film can generate a voltage of 0.51 volts per cell, with remarkably high efficiency.

"The judges also appreciated our choice of materials, as we used waste products, making the innovation more sustainable," Nikayati added.

The solar paint film developed by the team has promising electrical output, achieving a notable voltage of 0.51 V per cell.

Nikayati and her team plan to further develop their solar cell creation. Their innovation, which generates electricity through paint, holds potential to benefit society and the environment significantly.

"If students have ideas, they should consult their lecturers and read as much literature as possible. My inspiration also came from reading various studies," Nikayati advised.
