This socialization is one of the efforts and concerns of the USU Dharma Wanita Persatuan to support the anticipation and handling of the 3 sins of education, namely cases of bullying, sexual violence, and intolerance which especially occur in the campus environment," explained the Chairman of the USU DWP.

USU PR - Dharma Wanita Persatuan (DWP) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a socialization on the Prevention and Handling of Sexual Violence (PPKS). This activity took place in the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall, Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) USU, on Tuesday (10/10/2023).

Chairman of DWP USU Novi Susanti Muryanto Amin in her remarks said that this socialization was an effort from DWP USU to support the anticipation and handling of the three sins of education, namely bullying, sexual violence, and intolerance on campus.

"This socialization is one of the efforts and concerns of the USU’s Dharma Wanita Association to support the anticipation and handling of the three educational sins, namely cases of bullying, sexual violence, and intolerance which especially occur in the campus environment," she said.

Dr. Sri Puji Saraswati Nizam as the head of DWP Ditjen Diktiristek was also present to support the successful implementation of the Minister of Education, Culture, Research and Technology Regulation (Permendikbutristek) Number 30 of 2021 concerning Prevention and Handling of Sexual Violence in Higher Education.

By holding the mandate of the university rectors, Nizam said they must also be involved in supporting the performance duties of their husbands as wives of the State Civil Apparatus (ASN) with all their duties and functions so that the implementation of prevention can be carried out properly in their respective campus environments and work together.

"We DWP with all its functional duties must also be involved in supporting the performance duties of husbands as ASN wives so that the implementation of prevention can be carried out properly in our respective campus environments, so DWP works with all communities on campus together to work together," she explained.

Nizam hopes that students will consider DWP as a mother in a second home who can embrace them so that DWP Sahabat Kampus can also run optimally.

He also told students to dare to speak up if they found unpleasant things and build an atmosphere of mutual support for Humanity on campus.

"Hello all, if you experience unpleasant things, whether it's bullying, whether it's tolerance or sexual violence, dare to spec up, there are many of them on campus who care about you so we DWP care, let's build an atmosphere that supports humanity on campus," she concluded.
