“Achieving an agreement regarding the program's implementation is very important and must be communicated well so that cooperation between USU and USM can run effectively and sustainably,” said Prof. Muryanto.

USU PR—The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., received an audience on Monday (02/26/2024) to discuss potential cooperation with the management of the Universiti Sains Malaysia Alumni Association (IKA-USM) North Sumatra. The activity occurred in the Rector's Audience Room, USU Central Administration Bureau Building.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. stated that USU has carried out various programs that support the implementation of the Tri Darma of higher education and is committed to adjusting the program to the potential for joint implementation with USM. In this context, it is necessary to determine the priority of the program to be implemented and concrete steps in its implementation.

“We will adjust what programs can be implemented together with USM. Therefore, it is necessary first to determine the program's priority to be implemented,” explained Prof. Muryanto.

Furthermore, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. explained that determining program priorities must follow a mature stage, considering the impact and benefits. For example, if a student exchange program is to be held, several points must be discussed in more detail, including procedures, facilities, and benefits that will be obtained by both parties.

“Achieving an agreement regarding the program's implementation is very important and must be communicated well so that cooperation between USU and USM can run effectively and sustainably,” said Prof. Muryanto.

Chairperson of IKA USM North Sumatra, Prof. Dra. Lusiana Andriani Lubis, M.A., Ph.D., stated that through increased information exchange, it can be a source of ideas for programs that can be implemented together. Although previously, there had been discussions about cooperation that would strengthen relations between universities, this audience was considered a further step to deepen collaboration.

“So far, there have been reinforcements for cooperation. To conduct training so that both parties achieve good achievements internationally,” said Prof. Lusiana.

Through this meeting, Prof. Dra. Lusiana Andriani Lubis, M.A., Ph.D., Professor of Communication Sciences at USU, hopes cooperation between the two universities can focus on knowledge exchange related to education, such as study programs, training, and student exchanges. The main goal is to increase each university's excellence.

“Yes, the hope is that we want to bring education, exchange of learning, training, and those from there who can come here. So we both increase the university's excellence,” hoped Prof. Lusiana.
