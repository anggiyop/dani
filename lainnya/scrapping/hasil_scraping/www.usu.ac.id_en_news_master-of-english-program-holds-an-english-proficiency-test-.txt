" We hope this activity can be a forum to measure the English language skills of 6th grade female students. And the results obtained can be improved again for the preparation of female students to enter a higher level of education, especially in university." Rahmadsyah hoped.

The Study Program of Master of English batch 2022 held a community service by conducting an English Language Proficiency Test for 6th grade female santri of Pesantren Darul Arafah Raya on Friday (16/12/2022). This is a form of student activity as a manifestation of the tri dharma of university in community service.

Rahmadsyah Rangkuti, M.A., Ph.D as the Head of USU Master of English Study Program hopes that the 6th grade female students at Pesantren Darul Arafah Raya can be benefited from the EPT as an opportunity to measure their English skills. Evaluating English language skills is useful and can be seen as a benchmark and motivation for students to prepare for university entry.

Total participants were approximately 200 students who were 6th grade female students. The sixth grade at Pesantren Darul Arafat is divided into seven classes, 6A - 6G, who were enthusiastic about welcoming the university students on the organizing committee for the test. The activity went well. The participants took the test in an orderly and conducive manner.

Not only to measure the English language skills of 6th grade female santri in Pesantren Darul Arafah Raya, but this TKBI activity also provides a certificate of the results obtained which participants can later attach as supporting documents in registering for SNMPTN.

Seeing the students' enthusiasm in doing the EPT, the school hopes this collaboration can continue. Educational institutions, in this case, USU and Darul Arafat Islamic Boarding School, can synergize with each other in building better education in the future.

" We hope this collaboration can continue and work together in building a better education in the future," said Ustadz Kudri, the Principal of Darul Arafat Islamic Boarding School.
