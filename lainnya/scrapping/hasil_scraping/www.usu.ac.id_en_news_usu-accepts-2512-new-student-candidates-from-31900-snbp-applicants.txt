This was conveyed by USU Vice Rector I, Prof. Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, in an official release issued by Universitas Sumatera Utara after the announcement of the 2025 SNBP results.

 

 

In 2025, USU experienced a surge in SNBP enthusiasts compared to 2024, which amounted to 31,351 enthusiasts. A total of 22,175 applicants placed USU as their first choice, while 15,738 applicants placed USU as their second choice. The SNBP capacity provided by USU this year is 2,606 seats. The study programs that are the favorites of USU SNBP participants are undergraduate law study programs (1,767 applicants), undergraduate pharmacy study programs (1,753 applicants), undergraduate management (1,743 applicants), undergraduate computer science (1,578 applicants), undergraduate accounting (1,488 applicants) and undergraduate medical education (1,263 applicants).

 

 

Continuing the statement of the General Chairperson of the Team in Charge of the National Selection of New Student Admissions in 2025, USU Vice Chancellor I reminded that participants who have passed the SNBP Pathway Selection in 2025 cannot register for the National Selection Computer-Based Written Test Based Test (UTBK-SNBT) in 2025, 2026, and 2027 as well as the Independent Pathway Selection. Therefore, participants who pass the SNBP Pathway Selection are urged to immediately verify their academic data and re-register from March 19 to 26, 2025. At the verification of academic data and re-registration, participants who pass the SNBP selection path must meet the provisions, namely showing the original report card, original achievement documents, original diploma / Certificate of Graduation (SKL), and meet other requirements set by the intended PTN. For participants who pass the SNBP Year 2025 Selection Path who apply for the Indonesia Smart Lecture Card (KIP Lecture), in addition to verifying academic data, economic data verification will be carried out based on documents and/or visits.

 

 

The USU Vice Rector I said that all participants who did not pass the SNBP 2025 did not need to be discouraged and discouraged, because there were still opportunities to enter USU through two other available channels, SNBT and SMM. Both programs open up opportunities for high school / middle school graduates to fill the quota USU provides. For students who want to try their skills at UTBK SNBT USU, registration has been opened from 11 to 27 March 2025, and the exam will take place from April 23 to May 3, 2025. The announcement of UTBK results will take place on May 28, 2025.

 

 

Furthermore, the USU Vice Rector I emphasized that in implementing the upcoming UTBK SNBT USU, participants must obey all established regulations and not try to cheat in the exam. “USU will conduct strict supervision for all UTBK SNBT participants so they do not have the opportunity to cheat. Participants are not allowed to bring items that are not related to the implementation of the exam. For violations of these provisions, sanctions may not allow them to take the exam and cancel their membership status,” said Prof. Edy.
