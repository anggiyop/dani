Good assessments and recommendations are certainly highly expected so that graduates are recognized for their competence and are ready to contribute to improving the level of public health," explained Dr. Anggia

USU PR - Faculty of Medicine (FK) University of North Sumatra held an Exit Conference Visitation Assessment of the Feasibility of Establishing a Sub-Specialist Doctor Education Program in Internal Medicine and Obstetrics and Gynecology Study Program, by the Indonesian Medical Council. Taking place on Floor IV of USU's Chairuddin Hospital hall, on Friday (1/12/2023).

The councilor team from the Indonesian Medical Council, namely, Dr. Mariatul Fadilah MARS., Sp.KKLP., Ph.D; as well as dr. Niyoman Mahartini Sp.Pk(K).

In his remarks, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si who was represented by the Director of USU's Directorate of Educational Development Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, S.T., MMIT explained that this visitation aimed to assess the feasibility of the two educational programs at USU's FK, to carry out operational academic activities according to predetermined standards.

"Good assessments and recommendations are certainly highly expected so that graduates are recognized for their competence and are ready to contribute to improving the level of public health," explained Dr. Anggia.

Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, S.T., MMIT hopes that this visitation can provide the motivation and support needed for the two study programs to develop and become more advanced. Especially for 5 specializations, namely Cardiovascular Specialization, Rheumatology, Tropical and Infectious Diseases, Fetomaternal and Reproductive Endocrinology Fertility.

"Hopefully what the councilors saw during the visitation which started from Wednesday to Friday, can provide good results and recommendations," hoped Dr. Anggia.

USU FK Dean Prof. Dr. dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe Sp.S(K) hopes that the good recommendations from the councilors can become a reference to further improve the quality and potential in supporting the progress of the Internal Medicine and Obstetrics and Gynecology Education and Sub-Speciality Program.

"So we already know a lot of recommendations and suggestions which we will use as a reference for improvement," said Prof. Aldy.

Based on Law No. 29 of 2004, dr. Mariatul Fadilah MARS., Sp.KKLP., Ph.D; explained that their task as a Medical Council is to maintain quality and ensure that an institution can produce sub-specialist graduates by the standards and quality that have been set. With the support of IT and AI literacy in the development of medical science.

"I think USU's FK is doing well. This is only possible because globalization demands digital transformation, so in the future, we will also have to continue to adapt to technology-based developments," said Dr. Mariatul.
