We are almost at the end of 2023, which will answer all records achieved and pending from individual or institutional plans set at the beginning of 2023,” says Prof. Muryanto

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the Inauguration Ceremony of Six Permanent Professors of USU, which took place at the USU Student Arena on Monday (12/18/2023).

The six inaugurated professors are Prof. Ir. Maya Sarah, S.T., M.T., Ph.D., IPM from the Faculty of Engineering; Prof. Dr. Ir. Yunilas, M.P. from the Faculty of Agriculture; Prof. Dr. Ir. Marheni, M.P. from the Faculty of Agriculture; Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM from the Faculty of Engineering; Prof. Ir. Yulianta Siregar, S.T., M.T., Ph.D., Eng., IPM from the Faculty of Engineering; and Prof. dr. Fazidah Aguslina Siregar, M.Kes., Ph.D. from the Faculty of Public Health.

In his speech, USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. highlighted that to conclude 2023, each institution will conduct a review evaluation and devise strategic and tactical steps for 2024. For this, USU will evaluate the planning documents and achievements obtained during 2023.

“We are almost at the end of 2023, which will answer all records achieved and pending from individual or institutional plans set at the beginning of 2023,” says Prof. Muryanto.

Each professor must be aware of USU’s internationalization program and indicators in academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty-student ratio, International faculty, employment outcomes, sustainability, international students, citation per faculty, and international research network.

Furthermore, the Rector of USU explained three substantive reasons why USU must become one of the world-class universities. First, to foster an academic climate to international standards. Second, to develop role models originating from USU, contributing to the realization of Golden Indonesia 2045. Third, to assist local and national economic growth through the role of campuses, creating a brand image of education tourism.

”These three substantive reasons must be achieved by working together, helping each other to implement the Tridharma,” says Prof. Muryanto.

In his achievement as a professor in digital engineering, Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM, intends to apply digital engineering in various faculties, including the Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, and Faculty of Cultural Sciences. This is expected to become an advantage in the future, in line with the increasing reliance on digital engineering.

Furthermore, Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM, explained that becoming a professor represents the highest career level for a lecturer. By reaching this position, lecturers are responsible for developing scholarship, research, service, and teaching. Therefore, the goal of every lecturer is to achieve the position of a professor.

‘My message is that as lecturers, we must implement Tri Dharma as best as possible. The professorship will come on its own if we continue to do our best work in Tri Dharma,” advises Prof. Fahmi.

For your information, USU currently has a strength of 171 active USU Professors. With 47 professors in 2023, USU has added 66 professors since 2021-2023.
