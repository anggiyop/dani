USU Park

Constructed in 2013, USU Park is a facility the Universitas Sumatera Utara provides for the academic community and the general public as a recreational service unit. The location of USU Park is right in the middle between entrance gates 2 and 3 and in front of the USU Rectorate Building. With tourism and recreation as the primary function, USU Park is facilitated with a roundabout fountain, a deer enclosure inhabited by dozens of deer of various types, and several kinds of poultry raised by USU. Another function is also assigned to the USU Park, which is as a medium of education on nature conservation and the animals in it for USU students.
