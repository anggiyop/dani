This is a very good idea from the Head of USU Library because it can be an Oasis for researchers, students, and lecturers who want to do research," explained Dr. Edy.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Library marked USU’s commitment to supporting and promoting cultural diversity by inaugurating the ‘Local Wisdom Corner’; the event took place in the 4th-floor reading room of the USU Library on Thursday (19/10/2023).

The Local Wisdom Corner was inaugurated by the Vice-Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs of USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., which was marked by cutting the ribbon.

Local Wisdom Corner at USU Library is the latest innovation that aims to introduce local knowledge and wisdom to students, lecturers, and library visitors—particularly, introducing the cultural richness in North Sumatra.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH., MA., appreciates the Head of the USU Library for successfully embodying a crucial aspect of the USU tagline, namely, Local Wisdom. The Local Wisdom Corner will assist researchers, students, and faculty members interested in conducting research and exploration related to local wisdom in North Sumatra.

“This is a very good idea from the Head of USU Library because it can be an oasis for researchers, students, and lecturers who want to do research,” explained Dr. Edy.

Dwi Endah Purwanti, Head of the North Sumatra Regional Library and Archives Office, expressed her delight at the invitation and believes that through this activity, strong cooperation can be established to preserve North Sumatra’s culture.

“Our main tasks also include preserving all the copyrighted works produced about North Sumatra, and we are happy that there are nearby partners like USU,” said Dwi.

The Head of USU Library, Laila Hadri Nasution, S.Sos., M.P., emphasized the importance of a deep understanding of the rich customs, ethnicities, and cultural elements. For this reason, the USU Library is determined to bring the local and ethnic wisdom of North Sumatra closer to the users, especially students whom Gen Z dominates.

“We need to understand that local wisdom and ethnicity are things that show Indonesia consists of various customs, ethnicities, and all things related to that,” said Laila.

Furthermore, Laila Hadri Nasution, S.Sos., M.P., introduced the cultural ornaments of North Sumatra in the USU Library, which include ethnic Malay, Batak, and Mandailing, and will be developed again. There are also about 230 book titles, and the USU library is processing a rare Dutch collection about Indonesia.

“We hope this collection will continue to grow and can support the strengthening of research in North Sumatra to achieve the Tri Dharma of higher education at USU,” Laila explained
