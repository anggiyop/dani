"The disparities that exist between us really serve to reinforce our faith in God, as no human being is flawless and can exist alone. To achieve common objectives within the framework of the nation and state, namely a wealthy and prosperous Indonesia, we are all dependent on one another, "Prof. Fidel said.

USU Public Relations - At the USU 2022 Oikumene Christmas celebration on Tuesday (20/12/2022), the Christian congregation appeared to fill the Auditorium Building of Universitas Sumatera Utara. The 2022 Oikumene Christmas theme is Seeking True Truth in the New Era, which is a reference to Isaiah 55:6. Governor of North Sumatra Edy Rahmayadi attended the event, which featured a sermon presented by Drs. Tiopan Manihuruk M. Th.

Prof. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), Sp. O.G, Subsp. F.E.R., Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, stated to the USU Christian academic community his delight in celebrating Christmas and the New Year in 2023. He believes this holiday would serve as a catalyst for increasing tolerance for humanity and the diversity God created.

"The disparities between us reinforce our faith in God, as no human being is flawless and can exist alone. To achieve common objectives within the framework of nation and state, meaning a prosperous and wealthy Indonesia, we are all dependent on one another, "Prof. Fidel said.

He noted that there are laws in Indonesia that safeguard the people's freedom of religion.

According to the Secretary, although the people of Indonesia hold many viewpoints and beliefs, they all seek blessings and grace from God in their lives.

"Diversity is not an excuse for causing conflict and violence or imposing one's own spiritual beliefs on others. Within these differences, we must be able to identify the common ground that connects us together as a nation that supports progress cooperatively, "he continued.

Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), Sp. O.G, Subsp. F.E.R also stated that although the themes carried by each Christmas celebration are different, they all have the same goal of creating peace, particularly at USU, so that they can be more focused and enthusiastic about achieving USU's vision and mission.

During the same event, Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita ST., MT, who serves as the Chairperson of PHBK USU, stated that the Christmas celebration served as a reminder to make the greatest possible contribution to the development of USU and Indonesia.

Prof. Himsar explained, "Since we have a PHBK organization, we use the Christmas season to remind ourselves that we are a vital part of USU."

Ir. Rudolf Sitorus, MLA, chair of the USU Oikumene Christmas Committee, ascribed this to the 2022 Christmas theme for the USU Oikumene. According to him, this subject aligns with the program launched by USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, in order to realize the goal of World Class University.

Ir. Rudolf stated, "Therefore, pure truth, new spirit, optimism, I believe, are built by USU students, particularly Christian students, and we believe that the Rector's efforts will be as successful as possible."

USU student choral groups, including the Ulos Choir, Consolatio Choir, El-Shaddai Choir, and Gloria Choir, sang a number of melodic songs that added to the festivity and solemnity of USU Oikumene Christmas 2022.
