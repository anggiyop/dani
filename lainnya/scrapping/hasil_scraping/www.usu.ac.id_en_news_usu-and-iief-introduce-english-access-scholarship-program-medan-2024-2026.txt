“I would also like to congratulate the participants who successfully passed the English Access Scholarship Program,” Prof. Himsar said in the middle of his remarks.

HUMAS USU - The Universitas Sumatera Utara in collaboration with the Indonesia International Education Foundation (IIEF) held The Induction of English Access Scholarship Program Medan Site 2024 to 2026 at the Multipurpose Building Prof. H. T. Amin Ridwan, Ph.D, Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) USU, on Friday (1/11/2024).

 

In his remarks, USU Director of International Relations and Global Partnerships Prof. Dr. Eng.

In the interview, Prof. Dr. Eng.

In addition, students who participate in this program will be directed to accompany foreign guests at USU and engage in other international activities. “We will consider the students as seeds for us to become ambassadors following exchange students,” explained Prof Himas.

 

Ruth Goode, Director of RELO at the US Embassy, said that the English Access Scholarship Program is the first step for students toward their dreams. She hopes that students can make optimal use of this program to achieve their goals and return to contribute to the progress of Indonesia. “We hope you have an extraordinary journey and later contribute to this great Indonesian nation,” she hoped.

 

Christie Mordhost, representative of the United States Consulate in Medan, expressed her appreciation for the perseverance and resilience of the students who made it to this point and believes that the skills they gained through this program will be the foundation for future success. He also emphasized the importance of English as a global language that opens opportunities brings peace, and builds collaboration. “I believe that English is a language that brings many opportunities, as well as peace and collaboration,” he said.

 

The participants who will take part in this program consist of 20 high school students and 20 first semester students majoring in English and English Language Education, who come from 6 high schools and 4 universities in Medan City, such as SMAN 17 Medan, SMA Muhammadiyah 02 Medan, USU, and UNIMED.
