“Even without external assistance, we make every effort to prepare everything related to this visitation,” said Dr. Dudut.

USU PR - The Faculty of Nursing of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visitation from the Evaluator Team of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Kemendikbud Ristek) in the framework of the Appointment of the Working Team for Monitoring and Evaluating the Performance of Public Service Implementation (PEKPPP). This event took place at the USU Faculty of Nursing Hall on Tuesday (22/10/2024).

 

This visitation activity was attended by two Evaluator Teams from the Ministry of Education and Culture Ristek, namely Dini Indrawati Simbolon, S.H., M.H., and Putri Julianti Mufida. This activity is an important momentum in efforts to improve the quality of public services at the USU Faculty of Nursing.

 

In his speech, the Dean of the USU Faculty of Nursing, Dr. Dudut Tanjung, S.Kp., M.Kep., Sp.KMB., revealed that preparation for this visitation had been going on for approximately six to seven months. He also expressed his appreciation for the hard work of the entire team in preparing for this visitation.

 

“Even without external assistance, we are doing our best to prepare everything related to this visitation,” said Dr. Dudut.

 

The Dean of FKEP USU also introduced several teams responsible for various aspects of public services, such as the team that handles Service Aspects, Information Systems, and Innovation. The USU Faculty of Nursing is determined to continue improving its performance through this evaluation.

 

“We learn a lot from other institutions to improve our service system, especially from Batam Polytechnic, which is an example of public service innovation,” he said.

 

Dini Indrawati Simbolon, S.H., M.H., from the Ministry of Research and Technology, highlighted the importance of the public service index as an indicator of an educational institution's performance. According to her, the results of the PEKPPP evaluation will be used as a basis for assessment by the Ministry of Administrative Reform and Bureaucratic Reform (KemenPAN RB).

 

“We hope this evaluation can encourage the improvement of public services in higher education institutions,” he explained.

 

During the evaluation process, the Evaluator Team will examine supporting data and assess various aspects of public services at the Faculty of Nursing. Dini Indrawati Simbolon, S.H., M.H., hopes that the evaluation results can have a significant positive impact on improving the quality of services at the USU Faculty of Nursing.

 

“We will verify all data, from facilities to administrative services, that have been prepared,” Dini explained.
