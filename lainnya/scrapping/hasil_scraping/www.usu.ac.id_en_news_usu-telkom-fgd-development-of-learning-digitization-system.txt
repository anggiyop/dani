"USU and Telkom are like building an ERP system," WR IV said.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) together with PT. Telkom Indonesia TBK held a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) discussing the development of the learning digitization system at USU in Operation Excellence through Digitalization to Advance Education of USU which was held at Grand City Hall Medan on Thursday (11/03/2022).

The development of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that will be carried out by Telkom to USU is a mutually beneficial cooperation in the field of education. ERP is an integrated system used by companies to integrate all company resources.

WR (Vice Rector) IV for Information, Planning, and Development at USU, Prof. Dr. Drs. Opim Salim Sitompul M.Sc said that Telkom would improve the existing ERP system at USU.

"USU and Telkom are like building an ERP system," WR IV said.

WR IV said that this collaboration is very important, especially in the all-digital era. Therefore, according to him, the cooperation between USU and PT. Telkom is a beneficial form of collaboration in the field of education.

"As we heard earlier, everything was withdrawn from the system, so if we don't prepare it, we will be left behind," Prof. Opim said.

After this, the collaboration between USU and Telkom will continue on the Digital Learning Center Building, which is currently under construction.

Efforts made by PT. Telkom Tbk in the realization of ERP, among others, is to facilitate the network at 2 USU campuses. Manager of Enterprise Service, Lyanie Novridha, said that PT. Telkom TBK will assist USU in the fields of Learning, Research, and Innovation.

In the field of learning, PT. Telkom TBK will provide assistance in drafting regulations to meet USU's needs, while in the field of Research, PT Telkom will bridge the joint collaboration in terms of research.

"That is also the value that we can offer at USU because we are also involved here as a corporation with experience in various fields to be able to contribute to the pentahelix ecosystem," Lyanie said.

Lyanie Novridha hopes to transmit innovation to USU so that USU can be involved in Telkom's innovation ecosystem, because Telkom is a company that prioritizes innovation both internally and externally.

"The innovations that we hope can be transmitted to USU, need a learning process," she emphasized. (©ULC)
