PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN : The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, participated in donating blood as part of USU's 69th Anniversary series. The blood donor activity was held at USU Pancasila Building, on Wednesday (9/8/2021). The Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and the Director of the USU Hospital also presented.

The USU Rector arrived at the location around 10:00am and immediately carried out a basic health check and took blood pressure measurements. Then, Muryanto Amin took a blood test to determine the blood group and rhesus. The results of the basic examination showed that the Rector of USU was able to donate blood. In his statement, the Rector of USU said that the blood donation activity was a series of USU's 69th Anniversary.

“This blood donation is part of USU's 69th Anniversary. This is also a form of community service carried out by the academic community. We support the supply of blood bags at the hospital," USU Rector said.

He also mentioned that the blood donation activity had been socialized to all USU academics to participate. Considering that this activity was carried out within USU, he hoped that all academics could participate.

“I hope our academic community can participate in this activity. Blood donation is also a form of maintaining health. In the future, we will try to coordinate with the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and the Director of the USU Hospital so that it can be carried out regularly," he said.

The blood donor activity committee, Dr. Raden Ajeng Dwi Pujiastuti MKed (Neu), SpS, also conveyed the same thing and expressed the hope that the activity would be routinely carried out in the future. He said this activity greatly helped the availability of blood bags at the hospital.

“Hopefully this activity can be carried out regularly, for example every three months. To make it easier, future activities may be carried out at the USU Hospital, "said Ajeng.

She also explained that the blood donation activity was not only devoted to USU academics but was open to the general public. The committee targets 100 bags of blood per day.

As is known, USU is currently holding a series of 69th Anniversary. The Faculty of Medicine as the main committee of activities has carried out a series of activities such as webinars, competitions, and others towards the peak event on September 21, 2021. (RR/©ULC).
