It will also have educational and tourism benefits, providing visitors with a mental refreshment." So these are the two functions we want to perform," explained the USU Rector.

USU PR - On Thursday, (27/07/2023), the Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) joined the Mayor of Medan and the Head of the Medan City Water Resources, Bina Marga and Bina Konstruksi (SDABMBK) Office held the groundbreaking the USU Retention Pond.

The construction of the USU Retention Pond is a work program undertaken by the Medan City Government in collaboration with USU in the hope that it will provide the best solution to the city's flooding problems.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., Rector of USU, stated that education and visitor tourism are another function of the retention pond.

"It will also have educational and tourism benefits, providing visitors with a mental refreshment." So these are the two functions we want to perform," explained the USU Rector."

The USU retention pond will hold 10,000 cubic meters of water with a drainage height of 1.3 meters. The catchment area of the USU retention pond extends from Dr. Mansyur Street to Pajak Sore. Rather than this retention pond, the service area is approximately 170 hectares. After this project, up to 400 families could be saved from flooding.

According to Medan Mayor Bobby Nasution, the Medan City Government will construct up to three retention ponds in the Medan area this year.

"The Medan City Government is attempting to construct several retention ponds in the Medan City area; this year, there are three retention ponds, two of which are adjacent," stated the Mayor.

Topan Obaja Putra Ginting, S.STP, M.SP, Head of SDABMBK Office, went on to explain the working mechanism of the USU retention pond.

"It will enter the pond when the collector drainage reaches a height of 1.3 meters," says the pond's owner. "We accommodate the 10,000 cubic meters so that it does not burden wet areas, which reduces the load," explained the SDABMBK Office's Head.

Topan Obaja Putra Ginting stated that the retention pond was built entirely with APBD funds. The project is scheduled to be completed in December 2023.
