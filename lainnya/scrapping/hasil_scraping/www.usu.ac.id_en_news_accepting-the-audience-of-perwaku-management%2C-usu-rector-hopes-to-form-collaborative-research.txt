"PERWAKU members can be grouped according to their interests and focus, for example those who focus on mangroves, focus on environmental disasters, and so on," the Rector said.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., accompanied by Vice Rector III Prof. Poppy Anjelisa Z Hasibuan received an audience from the DPW of the Indonesian Environmental Intellectuals Association (PERWAKU) to collaborate in handling environmental issues at the USU Rector's Office House on Tuesday (1/18/2022).

The Rector said that PERWAKU, most of whose members are USU lecturers, will establish synergies to provide solutions to environmental issues through research and community service activities. First of all, scientific groups can be formed to conduct collaborative research.

"PERWAKU members can be grouped according to their interests and focus, for example those who focus on mangroves, focus on environmental disasters, and so on," said the Rector.

Dr. Muryanto added that the scientific group could hold discussions, then produce research proposals on environmental issues that require attention to be submitted to Talenta.

"We can also direct the research towards commercialization and downstreaming," he said.

Meanwhile, through community service, according to the Rector, PERWAKU can help run USU-assisted village programs that foster villages to become independent.

"For example, if there is a prospect of using the environment for tourism development, we can make a clear program and form a team of experts," he continued.

Dr. Muryanto hopes that USU and PERWAKU, through this activity, is able to create a model for environmental management that can develop innovation from lecturers and provide learning for students. In line with this, the Chairman of DPW PERWAKU North Sumatra, Dr. Drs. Arlen Hanel John, M.Si. said, PERWAKU is a forum for scholars, scientists and the public who have a mission to restore environmental functions. His party will partner with all parties, both the government and business actors, including USU for future programs.

“USU and PERWAKU will form a program that can maintain the balance of the ecosystem for future generations. We will discuss again, there are many things that can be synergized, for example the waste problem,” he said.

He hopes that USU's teaching staff and students can do much to restore better environmental conditions in the future.(©ULC)
