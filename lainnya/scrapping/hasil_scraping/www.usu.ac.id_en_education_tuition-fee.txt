Education Costs for Diploma and Undergraduate Programs

UKT, or Single Tuition Fee, is a payment system applied in all State Universities (PTN) in Indonesia. Based on the Rector's Decision of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Number /UN5.1.R/SK/KEU/2024 concerning the Determination of the Tariff for Single Tuition Fees (UKT) and Institutional Development Fees (IPI) for New Students of Bachelor and Diploma Programs through the National Selection Path Based on Achievement, National Selection Based on Tests and Independent Selection within the Universitas Sumatera Utara, the amount of UKT is determined based on the student's economic ability, so that each student pays tuition fees per semester according to their ability and financial condition.

IPI or Institutional Development Fee is a fee charged to students as a contribution to developing higher education institutions. IPI is a community fund receipt for State Universities-Legal Entities (PTN-BH) and non-tax state receipts for State Universities other than PTN-BH. IPI is only intended for new students through the independent path.
