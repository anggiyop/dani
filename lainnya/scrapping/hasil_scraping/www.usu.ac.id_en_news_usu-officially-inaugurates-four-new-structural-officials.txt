"Appointing competent, highly dedicated, and reliable human resources amidst massive changes is key to achieving USU's goals and targets," said the Rector.

USU PR—The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., led the inauguration ceremony for new officials within USU, held at the Digital Learning Centre Building on Friday, March 1, 2024.

The officials appointed include Ikhsan Siregar, S.T., M.Eng., as the Director of the Directorate of Educational Development, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe, S.E., M.Si., as the Head of the Business Management Agency, Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi., as the Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, and Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, S.T., M.M.IT., as the Head of the Priority Program Evaluation Agency.

Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., stated that the four newly inaugurated officials will have important responsibilities in supporting the future growth and advancement of the university. Particularly, those tasked with continuing the planning and alignment of work programs are expected to further enhance performance and productivity compared to before.

The Rector expressed his hope that the new officials would bring fresh energy and enthusiasm, thereby strengthening USU's ability to achieve its major goals, especially in responding to changes swiftly and effectively.

"Appointing competent, highly dedicated, and reliable human resources amidst massive changes is key to achieving USU's goals and targets," said the Rector.

Ikhsan Siregar, S.T., M.Eng., mentioned that he would focus on increasing the number of students participating in the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) program by coordinating with USU deans to facilitate recognition of student activities outside the campus. Students still face difficulties in recognizing course credits when participating in the MBKM program.

"To improve performance, we will coordinate with the academic community to identify issues and find solutions," said Ikhsan Siregar, S.T., M.Eng.

After officially being inaugurated as the Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi., stated that she would seek collaboration opportunities with partners to increase scholarship quotas and focus on competitions at the Ministry, National, and even International levels for students.

"We aim to create units like the PKM Corner or the Puspresma. We will also intensify the Tracer Study by establishing a Tracer Study Center this year," added Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi.
