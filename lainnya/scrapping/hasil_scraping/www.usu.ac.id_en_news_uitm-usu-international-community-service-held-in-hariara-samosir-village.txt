The activity began with a visit to the Universitas Sumatera Utara and a sharing session on November 18, 2025. The session discussed various interesting issues, such as leadership knowledge, students' affairs and clubs/activities management system, high-impact programs, and long-term collaboration.

The Department of Student Affairs, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), in collaboration with Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar (MPP) and Sekretariat Mahasiswa Kolej Pengajian Kejuruteraan (SMKPK), organized the Global Leadership Through Volunteerism in Indonesia: Cultivating Academic and Social Skills in Students in Indonesia, which took place from November 16 to 20, 2024.

 

The activity began with a visit to the Universitas Sumatera Utara and a sharing session on November 18, 2025, which discussed various interesting issues, such as leadership knowledge, students' affairs & clubs/activities management system, high-impact programs, and long-term collaboration. Important themes such as the student affairs management system, student club/activities management system, international community service program, student mobility (inbound/outbound programs), visiting lecturers, MOU/MOA, and research collaboration programs were also discussed. The next day, November 19, 2025, international community service was held in Hariara Pohan Village, Samosir, North Sumatra.

 

This program is an opportunity to conduct various activities, such as leadership benchmarking to universities for student organization administrators and the Department of Student Affairs. The involvement of 30 UiTM student leaders and 8 Department of Student Affairs management team representatives aims to establish leadership collaboration with student organization leaders at the Universitas Sumatera Utara. It is hoped that this collaboration can improve leadership skills for student organization leaders and contribute to increasing the skills and experience of the participants.

 

This community service is one form of activity to support the achievement of SDGs, including by assisting in the form of lamps to residents in Hariara Pohan village, Samosir, which was received by representatives of the local village community, Piatur Sihotang.
