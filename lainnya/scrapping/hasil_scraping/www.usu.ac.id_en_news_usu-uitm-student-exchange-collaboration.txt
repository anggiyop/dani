PR USU - Rector of the University of North Sumatra (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos, M.Si attended the invitation for a visit and a collaboration discussion with Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM). The activity took place in the UiTM Vice Rector's Room on Saturday and Sunday (7/30-31/2022).

The meeting discussed the cooperation that will be carried out by USU with UiTM. One of them is about student mobility on short-term student exchange programs that last for several months and long-term student exchanges for a year. The program will involve 4 fields including, Engineering, Information Technology, Law, and Communication.

According to the Rector of USU, the competitors for USU and UiTM are local universities in their respective countries. The collaboration between USU and UiTM is an advantage for each other to improve university rankings.

"UiTM and USU are not competitors, local universities are our respective competitors so that they can benefit each other to increase rankings," he said.

The Rector of USU said that student mobility must begin in October with a delegation of 10 people from each related faculty. Later the deans at UiTM will adjust as many as 20 credits. The initial stage will try to work with 1 faculty first if it is not possible to work with 4 faculties at once.

"One faculty can work together first if four faculties can't make it all at once," said the USU Rector.

Later, mobility funds will be provided which will be focused on USU. After the mobility begins, both universities will be able to immediately send citations for the assessment of Quacquarelli Symonds (Qs) world university rankings. (©ULC)
