“We believe that the quality of education has an impact on many aspects, so we must prioritize this,” said Vice Rector II USU

USU PR - Together with PT Pacific Medan Industri, the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) on Tuesday, (29/10/2024), which took place in the USU Academic Senate Conference Room. Faculty of Engineering (FT), Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA), Faculty of Psychology (FPsi), Faculty of Pharmacy (FF), and Faculty of Vocational Studies (FV) participated in this collaboration.

The event was opened by USU's Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance, Dr. Muhammad Arifin Nasution S.Sos., M.SP., who emphasized that education is the key to success for all generations to achieve a bright future. Education is considered to be indirectly closely related to other aspects of life such as health, social, politics and industry.

The industrial world is currently working hand in hand to provide support for various activities with the aim of improving education, such as sharing knowledge and opening internship opportunities to direction for fresh graduates, including PT Pacific Medan Industri.

A total of 117 USU students in recent years have been supported by PT Pacific Medan Industri to participate in the internship program. Vice Rector II USU hopes that one of the Corporate Social Responsibility programs can provide students with the opportunity to continue to improve their skills in the field of research as needed in the future.

“We believe that the quality of education has an impact on many aspects, so we must prioritize this,” said Vice Rector II USU.

Ali Saleh Ali Sulaiman as the Director of Operations of PT Pacific Medan Industri chose USU to be a collaborative partner in efforts to improve the quality of education because it is one of the best campuses in Indonesia. Research and Development is the achievement initiated for this program.

In the future, Ali Saleh hopes that this program can collaborate with more fields and through this collaboration, USU students get a good education to achieve a bright future that can contribute positively to the nation and state.

“Our priority is education, and USU is one of the best universities in Indonesia, which we hope will be a good bridge to other successful collaborations in the future,” added Ali Saleh.
