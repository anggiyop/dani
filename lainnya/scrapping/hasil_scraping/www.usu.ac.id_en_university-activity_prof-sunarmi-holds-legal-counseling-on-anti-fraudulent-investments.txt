A Professor at Universitas Sumatera Utara, Prof. Dr. Sunarmi, S.H., M.Hum., led a team of USU lecturers in carrying out the Professor Serves Community Service Program in Deli Serdang Regency. The team consisted of Prof. Dr. Sutiarnoto, M.S., S.H., M.Hum., and Nismah Panjaitan, S.T., M.T., Ph.D. The community service activity took the form of legal counseling under the title "Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) for Women Against Fraudulent Investments in Dalu Sepuluh A Village." This program was funded by the USU non-PNBP fund for the 2022 fiscal year.

This activity was attended by 21 women and representatives from the Dalu Sepuluh A Village government in Deli Serdang. It was conducted in person at the Dalu Sepuluh A Village Office Hall and officially opened by the Village Head, Sugianto, S.H., M.H.. It began with an explanation of fraudulent investments, strategies to address them, and the legal aspects related to such schemes.

An evaluation of the 21 participants who attended the legal counseling session showed increased knowledge about fraudulent investments. The results of this activity indicated that the community service program was successful, with most participants expressing satisfaction with the session. The team recommended follow-up community service activities in Dalu Sepuluh A Village, mainly targeting men, husbands, and the Village Government. This would further enhance public awareness of the dangers of fraudulent investments and help protect individuals and their families from financial scams.
