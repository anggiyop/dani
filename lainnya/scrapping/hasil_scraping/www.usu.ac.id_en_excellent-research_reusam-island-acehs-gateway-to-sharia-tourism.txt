Reusam Island in Aceh Jaya has great potential as an ecotourism sharia tourism destination, with stunning natural beauty and rich ecosystems. This research highlights the importance of sustainable management to protect the environment and support local communities.

Indonesia, with its wealth of over 17,000 islands, is one of the most enchanting tourist destinations in the world. Each island, from the famous Bali to the culturally rich Yogyakarta, offers a unique blend of natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. This diversity has long attracted tourists from around the world who wish to experience Indonesia’s majestic landscapes and vibrant traditions.

However, in recent years, there has been a significant shift in the tourism sector. The traditional model of mass tourism, which often prioritizes quantity over quality, has gradually given way to a more thoughtful and environmentally conscious approach, known as special interest tourism. This shift has been driven by growing awareness of the importance of protecting and preserving the environment and culture, which are the primary attractions of Indonesia. As noted by experts from Universitas Sumatera Utara, Indonesia—comprising Izwar, Badaruddin, Miswar Budi Mulya, and Robert Sibarani—their research demonstrates that this new orientation emphasizes sustainable practices that respect and preserve the natural and cultural assets of a destination.

In their research, they found that one region in Indonesia reflecting this change is Aceh Jaya Regency, an area blessed with extraordinary natural beauty yet relatively untouched by crowds. Located at the western tip of Sumatra, Aceh Jaya has a stunning coastline stretching approximately 160 kilometers, adorned with pristine beaches and dense forests. Among its many attractions, Reusam Island stands out as a hidden gem with tremendous eco-tourism potential.

Located in the serene Rigaih Bay, in Setia Bakti District, Reusam Island offers a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Its unspoiled beaches, diverse marine life, and remarkable ecological wealth make it an ideal candidate for eco-tourism development. Eco-tourism, by definition, is a model of tourism that seeks to balance the needs of visitors with nature conservation, creating a harmonious relationship between human activity and the environment. “It's not just about enjoying nature; it's about respecting it, learning from it, and ensuring that it remains preserved for future generations,” explained Izwar.

Prof. Badaruddin, who is part of the research, emphasized that the concept of eco-tourism is not without its challenges. One of the biggest obstacles is the threat of environmental degradation caused by irresponsible human activities. Pollution, littering, and damage to fragile ecosystems, such as coral reefs, are common in areas where tourism is poorly managed. These issues underscore the importance of effective eco-tourism management, which requires a careful balance between welcoming tourists and protecting the environment.

“The experience of other countries, like Honduras, where tourism has caused severe environmental damage, serves as a valuable lesson for Indonesia in developing its eco-tourism industry,” said Prof. Badaruddin.

Coastal areas, such as those surrounding Reusam Island, play a crucial role in the success of eco-tourism. These areas are unique because they represent the complex interaction between marine and terrestrial environments, creating diverse and fragile ecosystems. Coastal areas provide many ecological and economic benefits, from offering habitats for various species to supporting fisheries and recreational activities. They also serve as natural buffers against storm surges, help with carbon storage, and improve water quality, making them vital to both the environment and local communities.

Among coastal ecosystems, mangroves stand out as particularly important. These unique trees, with their intricate root systems, play a vital role in stabilizing shorelines, preventing erosion, and protecting against natural disasters such as tsunamis and typhoons. Mangroves are also essential for maintaining the health of broader coastal ecosystems, supporting biodiversity, and providing nursery habitats for marine life. Their ability to absorb carbon further enhances their value in combating climate change.

Similarly, seagrass meadows, or "lamun" ecosystems as they are locally known, make significant contributions to the marine environment. These underwater grasslands are not only crucial for stabilizing sediment and improving water quality, but they also play a role in the carbon and nutrient cycles. Seagrass meadows provide critical habitats for various marine species and support the productivity of coral reefs and fisheries, making them integral to ocean health and the livelihoods of people who depend on them.

“Given the ecological importance of coastal areas and these ecosystems, Reusam Island's potential as a Sharia eco-tourism destination is immense. Sharia eco-tourism, a concept that combines environmental conservation with Islamic principles, offers a unique opportunity for Aceh Jaya to develop tourism in a way that is not only sustainable but also culturally appropriate. Integrating Islamic values into eco-tourism practices can enhance the visitor experience while ensuring that the environment and local communities are respected and supported,” explained Prof. Badaruddin.

To assess this potential, the research team conducted a comprehensive study involving a survey of 660 samples to evaluate the island’s natural resources, ecological capacity, and the feasibility of applying Islamic Sharia principles in its tourism practices. The findings were overwhelmingly positive, with respondents agreeing that Reusam Island has the potential to become a Sharia eco-tourism destination in Aceh Jaya. However, the study also highlighted several areas that require attention, particularly the coral reefs, which are currently popular for diving and snorkeling but need better management to prevent degradation.

The research results indicate that the development of Reusam Island as a Sharia eco-tourism destination requires careful planning and collaboration between various stakeholders, including local government, community members, and tourism operators. The Indonesian government has already set ambitious targets for the tourism sector, aiming to increase its contribution to GDP, boost foreign exchange earnings, and expand job opportunities. Eco-tourism, with its focus on sustainability and environmental conservation, aligns with these goals, offering a pathway to long-term economic growth without sacrificing the environment.

In conclusion, the story of Reusam Island is one of extraordinary potential. With its stunning natural beauty, rich ecological diversity, and strategic location, the island is poised to become a leading destination for Sharia eco-tourism in Indonesia. However, realizing this potential will require collective efforts to protect and preserve the island's unique ecosystems while also ensuring that the benefits of tourism are shared equitably with local communities. “By adopting the principles of eco-tourism and Sharia, Reusam Island can become a tangible example of how tourism can be both profitable and sustainable, offering visitors an experience that is not only enjoyable but also enriching and respectful of the natural world,” concluded Prof. Badaruddin.

As Indonesia continues to explore new paths in tourism development, the example of Reusam Island serves as a reminder of the importance of balancing growth with conservation. With careful planning and a commitment to sustainability, Indonesia can continue to welcome tourists from around the world while preserving the natural and cultural riches that make it a truly special place. Ultimately, the success of Reusam Island as a Sharia eco-tourism destination will not only be measured by the number of visitors it attracts but also by the positive impact it has on the environment and local communities, ensuring that this beautiful island remains a paradise for generations to come.
