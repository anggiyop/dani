USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: Realizing maximum public services and integrity, the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., emphasized that he would encourage all work units within USU to become a Corruption-Free Integrity Zone (ZI WBK). The statement was conveyed when responding to the evaluation of ZI WBK at the USU Faculty of Nursing, Tuesday (6/29/2021) in the USU Academic Senate Meeting Room.

“There are at least 27 work units within USU.We hope that we will prepare ourselves to achieve the title of Corruption-Free Territorial Integrity Zone as a form of our efforts to providemaximum service," the USU Rector said.

She hopes that the USU Faculty of Nursing, which is a pioneer in promoting ZI WBK, can transmit this spirit to all existing work units.With the ZI WBK, it will bring up a work culture and organizational management that supports USU's ranking.

“USU's Faculty of Nursing is here to open the door in an effort to achieve ZI WBK.The experience received by the USU Faculty of Nursing must be maximized as a lesson for us to be able to apply ZI WBK inother work units," he said.

The USU Rector on this occasion received a presentation delivered by the Inspectorate General Team of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (Intjen Kemenduikbudristek) who conducted an evaluationat the USU Faculty of Nursing.

"We received information that the results obtained from the assessment of the Integrity Zone Evaluation Worksheet at the Universitas Sumatera Utara at the Faculty of Nursing were 54.14.This result is actually a very good result, considering the maximum valueis 60," he said.

According to him, it is not something to be proud of even though it has achieved good results.He encourages all parties concerned with this matter to always strive to achieve maximum results.

“This good result should not stop us.We still have a lot of work to do.Although good, there are some points that still need further handling.And I hope that these documents can be studied properly and duplicated, so that they can be distributed to other work units,” he added.

The Inspector General of the Ministry of Education and Culture, who finished the evaluation period by presenting the results of the evaluation in front of the USU Rector, said that the USU Faculty of Nursing had a very high chance of winning the WBK ZI predicate.This was conveyed by Salwin MD as theQualityController of the Inspectorate General of theMinistry of Education and Culture.

“The opportunity for the Faculty of Nursing is still wide open.There is still time until July 12, 2021 to complete the existing deficiencies.Here I also recommend that theUSURectorcan instruct lecturers to fill out application portals managed by the ministry, namely SurfingPAK and SISTER," Salwin said.

He also said that his party was open to discussion and exchange of ideas in completing the shortcomings of the USU Faculty of Nursing in winning ZI WBK upon returning to Jakarta.He hopes that this can motivate the USU WBK ZI Team to work harder.

In addition to Salwin MD, representatives of the Inspectorate General of the Ministry of Education and Technology were present, Riza Wularsih as technical controller, Dasuki as team leader and Thessalonika Ruth Damayati as team members.Also present were USU's vice Rectors, university secretaries, rector's expert staff, deans and vice deans of the USU Faculty of Nursing and the USU bureaucratic reform team.(RR/©ULC)
