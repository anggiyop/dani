About Ekonomi Syariah USU Student Activity Unit

KSEI FOSEI USU (Kelompok Studi Ekonomi Islam Forum Studi Ekonomi Islam USU or the USU Islamic Economics Study Group of the Islamic Economics Study Forum) is a student activity unit established in late 2013. Although it is called Islamic economics study, this UKM is open to all USU students from various majors. In line with its vision of "Embodying Islamic Economics," this student activity unit is enthusiastic about spreading information to revive Islamic values in all economic activities, which ultimately fosters unity among Muslims. Delegates from KSEI FOSEI USU have also received awards at the National Scientific Meeting in 2022. This makes KSEI FOSEI USU a competent student activity unit to enhance the reputation of USU. Therefore, KSEI FOSEI USU provides freedom for USU students motivated to experience and disseminate the benefits of Sharia economics to the wider community.
