"If later elected as USU's envoy at the regional level, this victory should be used as an encouragement to present the best performances and presentations at the regional level to continue to survive to the national level," said the Rector.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) announced the winners of the Selection of Outstanding Students (Pilmapres) in the Awarding Night for the 2022 USU Pilmapres on Tuesday (31/05/2022) at USU's Inter Coffee.

In his remarks, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that there were three winners from the S1 program and three winners from the D3 program, who would later represent USU at the regional and even national level.

"If later elected as USU's envoy at the regional level, this victory should be used as an encouragement to present the best performances and presentations at the regional level to continue to survive to the national level," said the Rector.

The Rector of USU also appreciated all the Pilmapres participants who indeed have shown all their best abilities and skills to win this competition.

"Always be enthusiastic about the winner and don't be complacent," he said.

On the same occasion, Vice-Rector (WR) I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH., MA said that all participants who had participated in this competition were winners because they had been selected from thousands of students at USU.

"Hopefully, the winner of the Pilmapres this time can reach the national level and become the winner," said WR I.

Prime Outstanding Bachelor Student I Muhammad Rafli Derriansyah from the Faculty of Engineering said that this was just the starting point of the struggle because then he would compete at the regional level.

"I hope to be able to carry the name of USU at the regional and national levels," he said.

Rafli also advised the participants who want to take part in the Pilmapres next year to prepare themselves by increasing their talents and improving their soft skills and hard skills.

"It's an award for me because I was chosen as the winner and representative of USU at the regional level," he said.

Meanwhile, Faculty of Engineering Student Adilla Syafira, as the Prime Outstanding Student and the Favorite Outstanding Student, said that he was very happy and did not expect to win two nominations. He also advised students who wish to participate in the Pilmapres next year to prepare themselves by seeking information and discussing with Outstanding Students in previous years.

"Hopefully, students who want to participate in the Pilmapres next year can prepare themselves and continue to practice," he said.
