“Some time ago, I discussed with related parties, including the Minister of Defense, about how to achieve this target amid global uncertainty,” said Prof. Muryanto.

USU PR - The Alumni Association of the Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Sumatera Utara (IKA FEB USU) organized an Exclusive Public Lecture with the theme “National Economic Outlook in the Midst of National & Global Socio-Political Turbulence.” This event took place in the Suhadji Hadibroto Hall of FEB USU on Friday (11/10/2024).

 

On this occasion, 12 students from the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) and the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) received scholarships provided by IKA FEB USU. This public lecture also presented the President Commissioner of PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk as well as the 28th Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia (2013-2014), Muhammad Chatib Basri as a speaker.

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in his speech, highlighted the importance of stability in maintaining economic growth, especially in the midst of challenging global conditions. He revealed that Indonesia's economic growth target, which is expected to reach 7-8 percent, faces many obstacles.

 

“Some time ago, I discussed with related parties, including the Minister of Defense, about how to achieve this target amid global uncertainty,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

Head of IKA FEB USU and Director of Compliance & Human Capital of PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk, Agus Dwi Handaya, emphasized the importance of synergy between the world of universities and corporations. He said that the meeting facilitated by IKA FEB USU aims to create collaborations that enable universities to produce graduates who are ready to face the challenges of the world of work.

 

“We facilitate this meeting so that the campus and industry can synergize so that universities can produce graduates who are ready to face the world of work,” Agus said.

 

In line with that, the Dean of FEB USU, Dr. Fadli SE., M.Si., explained further about the scholarship selection process that involved various parties, including IKA FEB USU and related faculties. The scholarship is not only given to students who have academic achievements with a GPA above 3.5, but also takes into account their soft skills.

 

“This scholarship aims so that students who receive scholarships not only develop academically, but also have skills that can support their future development,” explained Dr. Fadli.

 

The Dean of FEB USU also expressed his appreciation for the activities of IKA FEB USU, which have made many positive contributions to the faculty and university. With more than 36 activities carried out in the last two years, IKA FEB USU is considered successful in supporting USU's internationalization efforts.

 

“Hopefully, the synergy that has been established between IKA FEB USU, FEB, and USU can continue to be improved, especially in order to encourage USU to become a globally competitive campus,” hoped Dr. Fadli.
