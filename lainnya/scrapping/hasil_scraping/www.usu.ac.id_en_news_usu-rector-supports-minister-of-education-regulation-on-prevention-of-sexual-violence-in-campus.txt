Muryanto said, with the Minister of Education Regulation Number 30, there is a clear standard of measure to protect students from sexual violence.

USU PR - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr Muryanto Amin fully supports the Regulation of the Minister of Education, Culture, Research and Technology (Permendikbudristek) Number 30 of 2021 concerning the Prevention and Handling of Sexual Violence (PPKS).

Muryanto said, with Permendibudristek Number 30, there is a clear standard of measure to protect students from sexual violence.

"USU supports Permendikbud Number 30 of 2021, with this regulation the campus has firmness in implementing the rules for preventing and handling cases of sexual violence," said Mury when asked for his response, Saturday (11/13/2021).

The Rector explained that prior to the PPKS Permendikbudristek, the rules regarding handling cases of sexual violence were floating. "The presence of Permendikbudristek will certainly be a guide for campuses to make derivative rules and provide certainty in taking action because there is a higher legal umbrella," he said.

Strengthening the PPKS Permendikbudristek, Muryanto explained, USU will make a rector regulation related to the formation of a Task Force Team as mandated in Permendikbud Number 30 of 2021.

"The Task Force Team was immediately formed to follow up on the contents of the Permendikbud, of course the objective is to eliminate sexual violence in campus," he said.

The Rector assessed that the PPKS Permendikbudristek also provided security guarantees for students, especially women, to be more comfortable in carrying out their learning activities in the campus environment. Not afraid of threats of sexual violence and dare to report if they become victims.

"The certainty of the rules is what the campus needs so that the prevention and handling of sexual violence can be followed up in accordance with the applicable rules," he said.

USU positively welcomes the issuance of Permendikbudristek Number 30 of 2021 as a momentum in maintaining university morality to fortify sexual violence in campus area. (©ULC)
