Allow me to represent the leadership of Universitas Sumatera Utara in congratulating the Faculty of Forestry at USU and the Forestry Study Program at USU on celebrating their Dies Natalis," said Arifin

USU PR- The Faculty of Forestry at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) celebrated its 9th Dies Natalis, coinciding with the 24th anniversary of the Forestry Program at USU. The event carried the theme "Bersinergi Menuju Fahutan Juara dan Hutan Lestari" (Synergizing Towards Champion Fahutan and Sustainable Forests). The celebration occurred at the Faculty of Forestry, Kwala Bekala Campus, on Wednesday (11/15/2023).

The Faculty of Forestry organized various activities to commemorate its 9th Dies Natalis. These activities included the inauguration of the construction of the FHUT USU Mosque in Bekala with drum beating, laying the mosque's foundation stone, and a talk show featuring FHUT USU Professors.

In his address, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., the Rector of USU, represented by Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP., explained the meaning of "juara" (champion) in the event's theme, interpreted as "jujur" (honest), "unggul" (excellent), "agamis" (religious), "respect"(respectful), and "adaptif" (adaptive). The theme is expected to instill a new spirit in facing challenges in the present and future.

"Allow me to represent the leadership of Universitas Sumatera Utara in congratulating the Faculty of Forestry at USU and the Forestry Study Program at USU on celebrating their Dies Natalis," said Arifin.

Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP., conveyed that with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and technological industries, significant changes have occurred in human interaction with nature, especially in forestry. Challenges such as climate change and forest degradation are the focus of attention for the Faculty of Forestry. Therefore, it is hoped that the Faculty of Forestry at USU can be a center for research and innovation.

"In recent years, we have witnessed significant changes in various aspects of our lives. Climate change and forest degradation pose challenges to the Faculty of Forestry," explained Arifin.

At the same event, the Dean of the Faculty of Forestry, Dr. Rudi Hartono, S.Hut., M.Si., emphasized their goal of advancing USU and achieving World Class University status. They strive to collaborate with internal and external stakeholders. Alums also play a significant role, actively supporting various activities in the faculty.

"On November 18, there will be an event for alumni where they will return to the campus as alumni from Forestry Faculties across Indonesia," said Dr. Rudi.

Dr. Nelly Anna, S.Hut., M.Si., as the Chair of the Committee, presented the series of activities for the Faculty of Forestry's Dies Natalis celebration that began in August 2023. The activities involved various events, including competitions for students such as TikTok contests, photography contests, sports competitions, and other activities. The Dies Natalis celebration also included a talk show featuring Professors on the day.

"This talk show is our expression of gratitude; in this year, four Professors were inaugurated in 2023," explained Dr. Nelly.
