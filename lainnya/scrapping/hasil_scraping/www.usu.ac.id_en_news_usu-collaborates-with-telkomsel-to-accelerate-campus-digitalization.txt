"We plan several points for digital areas. Like the sports center, later, there will only be one access using a digital method that can be used for all facilities. In addition, we are also preparing the USU Information System Center (PSI) and the Kuala Bekala area as USU's second campus to become a digital area," he said.

 

Public Relations USU—To support campus digitalization, USU is preparing to develop digital areas in several locations as an initial step. USU collaborates with various parties in this effort so that planning runs smoothly.

 

One of them is by preparing a digital area in collaboration with PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk. USU hopes that PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk can support the development of digital area infrastructure.

 

"We currently hope that cooperation can be realized to prepare digital areas in several locations in the USU environment. With the presence of PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk, we are confident in its progress as a leading telecommunications company in Indonesia. We hope that the resources they have can contribute," said USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S Sos, M Si, Monday (27/9/2021), in the USU Rector's Official Residence Meeting Room.

 

The Rector has planned several digital area locations that prioritize digital access in every activity.

 

"We plan several points for digital areas. Like the sports center, later, there will only be one access using a digital method that can be used for all facilities. In addition, we are also preparing the USU Information System Center (PSI) and the Kuala Bekala area as USU's second campus to become a digital area," he said.

 

The Rector also opened an offer to become a partner of Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka with PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk.

 

He gave an example of several partners collaborating to develop students through internship programs. He hopes PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk can open the same opportunities for USU students.

 

"Several of our partners have explored cooperation to be able to accept our students in internship programs at the company. We hope that PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk can also open this opportunity to further opportunities for students to gain experience," he said.

 

The USU Rector guaranteed that students who take part in the MBKM program will later be selected and adjusted to the criteria needed by PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk. In the end, it is hoped that PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk can maximize the potential of these students through employee recruitment.

 

General Manager of Telkom Witel Medan, Binsar Silalahi, stated that his party is ready to support the development of a digital area in the USU environment.

 

"We are here to express our support and are ready to contribute to the development of education in higher education, especially USU. We prepare our resources to be directly involved in these efforts. In addition, we are also open to cooperation in other fields that we can do," said Binsar.

 

Account Manager Sri Dwiningsih, Government Service Manager Lyanie Novridha, Vice Rector III USU Dr Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S Si, M Si, Apt, and Head of the Information System Center Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, ST, MMIT were present at the meeting.
