Reviewing the Implementation of UTBK-SNBT 2025 at USU, Rector Affirms Legal Sanctions for Exam Cheaters

The USU Rector appealed to all test takers not to use fraudulent means to pass. "UTBK is a test of honesty, about how our nation's children compete not only about intelligence and graduation. This UTBK is a test of patience and a test of honesty, which can have many impacts when he later undergoes lectures. We hope that all participants will follow the competition in accordance with the existing regulations, because if they cheat, it will not provide much benefit for themselves. This is about character, because character will be an important part that determines, not just academic matters," he said.
