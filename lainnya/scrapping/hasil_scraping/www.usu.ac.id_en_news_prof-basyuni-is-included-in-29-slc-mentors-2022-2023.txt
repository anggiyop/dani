He is one of 29 selected international scientists who will become the 2022/2023 Mentors in July 2022.

Prof. Basyuni has previously been involved in several collaborative initiatives with scientists from various countries, including the e-Asia JRP in 2021 and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Core to Core 2020-2023.
