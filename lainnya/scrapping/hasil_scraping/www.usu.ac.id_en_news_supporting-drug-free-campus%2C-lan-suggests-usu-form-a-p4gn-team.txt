He advised the Rector to form a USU P4GN (Prevention, Eradication, Countermeasures and Illicit Trafficking of Drugs) Team. If there is a tagline “Indonesia Bersinar” (Clean from Drugs), then make “USU Shines”.

USU Public Relations - Head of the Anti Narcotics Institute (LAN) of North Sumatra Province, Apt. Razoki Lubis, SSi, MKes, MBiomed supports the policy of USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin who fights drug trafficking in the campus environment. According to him, the firm action taken by USU by cooperating with BNN Provsu needs to be followed by other educational institutions.

"We are of course quite concerned to hear this news, but we also cannot ignore that today drugs have entered the education sector. So I also ask BNN Provsu to check other universities related to drug abuse," Razoki said in his statement, Thursday (10/14/2021).

LAN indicated that drug crimes are also rampant in other higher education institutions. "Today it is USU who dares to expose with all the consequences, other universities must also be brave," he said.

Razoki considered that the steps taken by USU related to drug eradication were appropriate. As a leading educational institution, USU must be free from drugs.

The USU Rector's policy of establishing an anti-narcotics students and task force needs support from all parties, including related institutions.

This alumnus of the USU Faculty of Pharmacy explained that there is a need for advocacy to each faculty regarding the prevention and campaign of narcotics abuse. "After the action, there must also be a preventive program that is carried out regularly," he said.

He advised the Rector to form a USU P4GN (Prevention, Eradication, Countermeasures and Illicit Trafficking of Drugs) Team. If there is a tagline Indonesia Bersinar (Clean from Drugs), then USU Shines is made.

These prevention programs, added Razoki, will be effective in preventing the return of drug trafficking in the campus environment. All academics must be involved in the USU P4GN Team, such as from the faculties of pharmacy, public health, medicine, psychology, cultural studies, students, alumni and other anti-drug institutions.

"The USU P4GN team cooperates with the BNN or the police, so that if a crime of narcotics abuse is found, it is enough for the USU P4GN Team to take care of it. This team must also be proactive in conducting drug prevention campaigns in the campus environment," said Razoki who also the Head of the Undergraduate Clinical Pharmacy Study Program, FK Unpri.

LAN also advised USU to conduct urine tests on students, lecturers and staff. "This test does not need to be comprehensive, so it is only a sample with certain sampling indicators," he said.

According to him, with these programs USU will be free from drugs.

"Once again, LAN fully supports the USU Rector's policy and hopes that the war on drugs will continue until the campus is completely free from the practice of drug abuse," he concluded. (©ULC)
