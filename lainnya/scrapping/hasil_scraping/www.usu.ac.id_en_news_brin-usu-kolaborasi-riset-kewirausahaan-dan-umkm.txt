USU was represented by Vice Rector III Poppy Hasibuan and the Head of the USU Innovation Research Development Agency (BPRI), Buchari. Poppy explained that this initiative departed from the desire to establish research cooperation so that MSME players can master digital platforms and market research. Poppy explained that MSMEs in North Sumatra can be clustered. She hopes that USU can oversee MSME activities with the help of BRIN.

USU PR - The National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) is exploring research cooperation on Entrepreneurship and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) with the Universitas Sumatera Utara  (USU). This was revealed when BRIN's Governance, Economy, and Community Welfare Research Organization (OR TKPEKM) received a visit from the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) at the BRIN Meeting Room Gatot Subroto, Wednesday (8/6/2022).

Head of OR TKPEKM, Agus Eko Nugroho, also attended the hearing and emphasized the importance of digital ecosystem development for MSMEs, especially in North Sumatra (Sumut). This is useful for strengthening the competitiveness of MSMEs and SMEs.

“Entrepreneurship research and product commercialization of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Small and Medium Industries (SMIs) are very interesting. MSMEs are one of the pillars in Indonesia in terms of number and absorption,” added Head of the Macroeconomic and Financial Research Center (PR EMK) Zamroni in his remarks.

On this occasion, USU was represented by Vice Rector III Poppy Hasibuan and Head of the USU Innovation Research Development Agency (BPRI), Buchari. Poppy explained that this initiative departed from the desire to establish research cooperation so that MSME players can master digital platforms and market research. Poppy explained that MSMEs in North Sumatra can be clustered. She hopes USU can oversee MSME activities with the help of BRIN.

Buchari also explained the profile of BPRI USU and its activities. So far, BPRI USU has been actively assisting MSMEs by carrying out activities such as incubation, clustering, product data collection, patents, and so on.

OR TKPEKM researcher Bahtiar Rifai explained that BRIN has 5 pillars, namely innovation, learning, research, marketing, and financing, when conducting research in North Sumatra. During the research, Bahtiar also measured the level of digitalization of the manufacturing industry in Indonesia. Furthermore, Bahtiar explained the problems faced by MSMEs and SMEs based on research conducted by PR EMK.

He explained that the majority of MSMEs are still manually focused, while digital literacy or infrastructure is still minimal. In addition to this, there are state-owned enterprises (BUMN) that are interested in working together to realize joint research and development. “The focus of PR EMK's research is to improve MSME business processes with digital solutions, see the impact of technology, efficiency, employment, product expansion, and increased productivity,” he said.

In the future, it is expected that the scope of cooperation between BRIN and USU will be related to education, research, and community service. The conclusion drawn by PR EMK is that BRIN is open to various kinds of cooperation, be it research collaboration, degree by research or others. BRIN and USU can enter into direct research collaboration through the formation of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) or Cooperation Agreement (PKS) because of the many potential for cooperation.

On this occasion, the Head of the Research Center for Cooperatives, Corporations, and Popular Economy (PR KKEK) Irwanda Wisnu Wardhana and his team, TKPEKM Planning, Bureau of Law and Cooperation (BHKS), and Bureau of Public Communication, General, and Secretariat (BKPUK) BRIN Jakarta area were also present. The hearing was hosted by the Public Relations Coordinator for the Jakarta Gatot Subroto Area, Andriani Agustina.
