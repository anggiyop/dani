“International accreditation is a strategic step and a big leap that USU wants to achieve in realizing its big goal as one of the best universities in the world,” said USU Rector.

 

USU PR - The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., attended the simulation training and rehearsal of the Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation (FIBAA) Cluster 1 and 4 International Accreditation Visitation for universities, study programs, lecturers, students, alumni and education personnel, at the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB) on the 8th floor of USU, on Thursday (26/09/2024). This activity lasted for two days, September 26-27, 2024.

 

In his remarks, the USU Rector hopes that a number of study programs (Prodi) that are currently participating in international preparation can achieve maximum results. He also said that achieving FIBAA international accreditation is a strategic step and a major breakthrough that is expected to bring USU closer to becoming one of the best universities in the world.

 

“International accreditation is a strategic step and a big leap that USU wants to achieve in realizing its big goal as one of the best universities in the world,” he said.

 

The USU Rector said the simulation and rehearsal was the final stage of preparation before the official visitation, not just a technical test, but also an opportunity to unite understanding, strengthen coordination, and ensure that the entire USU academic community was ready to contribute to international recognition of the quality of USU.

 

“An opportunity for all of us to unite understanding, strengthen coordination, and ensure that every element of the university is ready to make the maximum contribution,” he said.

 

The USU Rector also appreciated all the hard work and dedication given by all parties. The Rector said the role of everyone who contributed was crucial in creating an atmosphere and substance that matched the expectations of FIBAA.

 

“We really appreciate the hard work, cooperation, and dedication that has been given by all parties,” he said.
