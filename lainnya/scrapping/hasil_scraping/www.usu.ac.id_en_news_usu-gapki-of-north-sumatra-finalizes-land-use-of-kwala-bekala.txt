USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) continues to open itself up to cooperate with various parties especially to manage its assets. Recently, USU has finalized a cooperation plan with the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (Gapki) North Sumatra Branch.

The two parties met in person at the USU Academic Senate Meeting Room, USU Central Administration Bureau, Thursday (8/7/2021). During the meeting, they discussed the follow-up plan for the development of the USU Campus II area in Kwala Bekala, Deli Serdang Regency. The development of the area is intended to improve academic services to students. In addition, the use of the land is expected to increase USU's income.

The Rector of USU, Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said that the collaboration between USU and the North Sumatra’s Gapki was entering a further stage. This is because USU and North Sumatra Gapki have previously signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).

"I think our conversation is now getting more conical. Previously, we had agreed on a plan to build a palm oil storefront, arboretum, and other facilities in the area," the USU Rector said.

Muryanto Amin also encouraged the follow-up to be immediately included in a Memorandum of Agreement. According to him, technical steps must be detailed in detail. In addition, he also hoped that the planning and timeline for the work could be attached.

“As soon as the proposal is prepared, I am trying to communicate with several ministries so that they can be assisted with grant funds. It is also equipped with a plan and timeline so that it can be included in USU's planning," he added.

Alexander Maha, Chair of the North Sumatra’s Gapki, welcomed the USU Rector's intention. He ensured that his party would work optimally to support the planning directed by the Rector of USU.

"We support 100 percent of the direction and expectations of the USU Rector. We are preparing a team that will later work on the technical process of developing the area so that it becomes what we expect, "said Alexander.

Alexander added that the agreement contained several aspects that were built in the area. Gapki of North Sumatra in this case became a facilitator and also helped USU manage the area.

"In this area, at least there will be construction of an oil palm storefront, a botanical garden, as well as a food security research area. Today, we are describing the palm oil display case first so that the follow-up of our plan could soon be realized”, he said.

The meeting was attended by representatives of North Sumatra’s Gapki that represented by Timbas Prasad Ginting, Mino Lesmana, and other groups. USU itself was represented by USU's Vice Rector III, USU's Vice Rector V, Head of the Asset and Business Bureau, USU Exist Team Leader, and USU education staff. (RR/YH-©ULC)
