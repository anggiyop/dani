In his remarks, the Dean of the USU FH, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, SH., M. Hum said that since ancient times, this country has been a country of law that adheres to the founding father system. From now until the future, the law will be used to determine direction and support in all aspects of this country's development.

"We are fortunate because we have used the legal system, so we can get justice," he said.

The Dean of the USU FH also said that national development goals will not be achieved if the right law is not used. According to him, the success of legal development requires discussions attended by various experts in the fields of law and regulation, which will later produce good ideas for the development of this country.

"I hope that those with expertise in the field of law can contribute together to the issues discussed," he said.

On the same occasion, the Director of Law and Regulation R.M Dewo Broto Joko Putranto, S.H., LLM. said that this activity will discuss three very important and influential legal issues: the prevention and eradication of corruption, the renewal of the national criminal law system, and strengthening access to justice with various strategic problems that cover it.

"This activity is carried out to find out what problems are being faced and find solutions to these problems by discussing in the FGD Background Study activity. Therefore, participation from the community is needed to convey their opinions and solutions. I hope to get input on legal development in this country," he said.
