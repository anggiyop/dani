The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., led the release ceremony of USU outbound students who will participate in the student exchange program to Riyadh, Bangkok, and Malaysia on Monday (02/26/2024). The event occurred in the Academic Senate Room, 3rd Floor, BPA USU Building, and was attended by university officials and representatives from various faculties.

Also attending the event were Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, M.A., and Vice Rector III, Prof. Dr. Apt. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, M.Si., and several deans from the Faculties of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Pharmacy, Law, and FISIP.

In his speech, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin was enthusiastic and hopeful. He reminded the students of the importance of maintaining the institution's good name and carrying out their duties and responsibilities well while abroad. "Students are ambassadors of USU; therefore, we hope you can be good representatives and positively contribute to your destination," he said.

In addition, the Rector also emphasized the importance of making the most of this study-abroad opportunity. "Not all students get the opportunity that you have today. Take advantage of every moment to learn, adapt, and develop yourself," he said.

The USU Rector also hopes that students who undergo student exchange programs and teach abroad can maintain the good name of USU while undergoing programs abroad. "Students must maintain their attitude and behavior while in other countries. Where the earth is trodden, the sky is upheld," he said.

 

The students were also asked to take the program seriously and responsibly. "We believe you can face every challenge well and return to USU with valuable experience and broader insights," he added. 

The event continued with a pocket money handover session for students participating in outbound programs to Sekolah Indonesia Riyadh, Sekolah Indonesia Bangkok, and UiTM Malaysia. After that, the Rector, Vice Rector, and faculty representatives congratulated and prayed for the success of the students before taking a group photo as a memento.
