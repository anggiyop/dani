"It is expected to be one of the milestones in terms of ZI-WBK development in the health sector because the faculty of medicine is one of the faculties that can be said to be the first faculty at USU,” he said.

USU PR - The Corruption-Free Zone Integrity Zone (ZI-WBK) was again socialized at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). The socialization was held at the USU Faculty of Medicine Hall on Tuesday (25/10/2022).

Secretary of the Directorate of Bureaucratic Reform and Transformation Imam Bagus Sumantri, S.Farm., M.Si., Apt. said that the Faculty of Medicine is one of the well-known health faculties at USU. Therefore, this faculty can be trusted to develop and implement a good integrity zone in order to increase further the potential of students at the USU medical faculty.

“It is expected to be one of the milestones in terms of ZI-WBK development in the health sector as well because the faculty of medicine is one of the faculties that can be said to be the first faculty at USU,” he said.

Imam Bagus also hopes that after this event the medical faculty can maintain its commitment and continue to implement and comply with the integrity zone because all faculties have made a declaration in terms of implementing the integrity zone.

“After the declaration of the integrity zone that has been carried out at the USU auditorium, then inshallah in the future, the faculty of medicine can be able to participate like the faculty of nursing in a form of ZI-WBK implementation,” he said.

On the same occasion, Vice Dean II FK USU. Dr. dr. Muara P. Lubis, M.Ked.(OG), Sp.OG (K) said that after this event, the medical faculty will hold a special socialization for 27 departments and 24 study programs in the medical faculty. This does not forget to socialize with laboratories and educators in the USU medical faculty.

Therefore, the entire academic community of the USU medical faculty is ready to implement the integrity zone properly.

“We will do all of this socialization, which will build a joint commitment from all stakeholders in the Faculty of Medicine to build this integrity zone,” said Vice Dean II FK USU.
