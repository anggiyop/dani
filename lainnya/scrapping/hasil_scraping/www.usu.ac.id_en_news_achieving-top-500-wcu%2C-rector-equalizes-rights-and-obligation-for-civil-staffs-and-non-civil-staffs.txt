The Rector of USU said that in achieving this target, USU must build the spirit together and must also equalize the obligations and rights between Civil Servants (PNS) and Non-Civil Servants (Non-PNS) and eliminate differences between PNS and Non-PNS.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Focus Discussion Group (FGD) activity in the context of Strengthening the Tasks of Tridharma towards the Top 500 World Class University. The activity took place at the USU Auditorium, on Wednesday (7/13/2022).

The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin., S.Sos, M.Si said that in the second Strategic Planning (Renstra) stage, USU will target the top 500 (Five Hundred) World Class University within five years by providing supporting programs for the success of USU's targets.

"I will target USU to reach the top 500 (Five Hundred) World Class University within five years," he said.

The Rector of USU said that in achieving this target, USU must build the spirit together and must also equalize the obligations and rights between Civil Servants (PNS) and Non-Civil Servants (Non-PNS) and eliminate differences between PNS and Non-PNS.

"In achieving the target, USU must build the spirit together and must also equalize the obligations and rights between PNS and Non-PNS," he said.

The USU Rector also said that for several supporting programs to achieve the target, USU lecturers must have relationships with lecturers outside USU, both nationally and internationally. So that later they have more experience and can exchange information about research and produce good publications.

"One way to achieve the target, USU lecturers must have a relationship with lecturers in the national and international arena," he said.

And another way to achieve USU's target of becoming a top 500 World Class University is by supporting the field of education, namely that students no longer have to study in class, but learning activities can be carried out outside the classroom.

One way is through student exchanges, internships, and students can go directly to the community to gain experience. (©ULC)
