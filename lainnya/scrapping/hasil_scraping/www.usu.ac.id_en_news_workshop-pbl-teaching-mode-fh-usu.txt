"We have collaborated with the Faculty of Law Maastricht University, and today we are realizing some of our cooperation commitments. Today is actually our joint commitment to realize what we talked about in the Netherlands yesterday,” he explained.

USU PR - The Faculty of Law, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Problem-Based Learning Teaching Method workshop which was held with 2 sessions on Wednesday (29/11/2023) in the Academic Senate Room, 2nd Floor, Academic Bureau for the first session, and the DPF Room, Faculty of Law, USU for the second session. This activity presented speakers from the Netherlands, Maastricht University, namely Dr. Sascha Hardt (.S).

The Dean of the Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, SH, M. Hum, explained that this workshop was held to realize one of the forms of commitment to cooperation between the Faculty of Law USU and the Faculty of Law Maastricht University that had been discussed at the time in the Netherlands.

“We have collaborated with the Faculty of Law Maastricht University, and today, we realize some of our commitments to cooperation. Today is actually our joint commitment to realize what we talked about in the Netherlands yesterday,” he explained.

Vice Dean of the Faculty of Law Dr. Agusmidah, SH, M.Hum said that this activity presented a resource person from Massstricht University Dr. Sascha Hardt (.S) who is one of the Faculty of Law lecturers who will explain how to teach using problem-based learning that they usually apply.

“The workshop was about teaching methods using problem-based learning, and it is common in law faculties abroad, so we will present the speakers directly from universities that have implemented it,” he said.

Preparing a number of appropriate supporting infrastructures so that problem-based learning can be directed and become a common guideline in order to get the learning outcomes of the course well done is an important point said by the Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Law, Dr. Agusmidah, S.H, M.Hum based on the presentation of material from the speakers.

“The important point is that, according to what he said earlier, we must prepare some infrastructure, some appropriate ones, so that problem-based learning can be directed and become a common guideline that can achieve the learning outcomes of each course well,” he said.

Dr. Agusmidah, S.H, M.Hum also hopes that in the future the USU Faculty of Law can apply problem-based learning accordingly and not based on opinion alone.

“Hopefully, in the future, we can apply this problem-based learning in accordance with the existing corridors so it is not based on mere opinion,” he concluded.
