PR USU - Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K) attended the commemoration of the Islamic New Year 1444 Hijriyah at the Hall of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) North Sumatra on Tuesday, (9/8/2022).

Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K) quotes tausiyah on the New Year's Day 1444 H that there are 3 dimensions that can be taken as the meaning of the Hijri New Year commemoration. These three things are spiritual, intellectual, and material and cannot be separated from each other.

"So from the tausiyah delivered by the ustaz, we can hear that from this hijri we need 3 dimensions, namely spiritual, intellectual, and material and all three cannot be separated from each other," Prof. Fidel said.

The Secretary of USU added that at USU there are teachings related to the material dimension, these must be combined with spiritual and intellectual so that they are in accordance with the meaning that can be taken on the commemoration of the Islamic New Year.

"Indeed, we may at USU teach a lot of material from several faculties, agriculture, engineering, medicine, etc., but this cannot be only in terms of material but must be combined from spiritual and intellectual aspects," he said.

Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K) said that his presence as a USU representative was not only to attend the Hijriyah New Year commemoration event but also to stay in touch with the Governor of North Sumatra, scholars, MUI chairmen, and other parties from several agencies.

"We are invited to attend the launching of the hijriyah calendar, yes, but our role is not only to attend but the same way we were in touch with the governor and Ulama were also present, the chairman of the MUI, and several agencies," he said.

On the same occasion, the Secretary of the University of USU hoped that with the celebration of the Islamic New Year 1444 H, USU could remember 3 dimensions, namely intellectual, spiritual, and material in life.

"We refer to the tausiyah delivered by the ustaz, don't forget the 3 dimensions in our lives, whether in terms of intellectual, spiritual, and material," the Secretary of USU mentioned. (©ULC)
