"The presence of experts, academics, practitioners, and all related parties in this FGD is tangible evidence of our commitment to collaborate in addressing these challenges," said Prof. Muryanto.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Expert Body of DPR RI signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), followed by a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) titled "Regulation of Strategic Commodities in Plantations and Their Processing Industries to Promote, Protect, and Improve the Welfare of Communities/Farmers and National Foreign Exchange Earnings." The event took place in the USU Rector's Audience Room on Tuesday, July 23, 2024.

 

The agreement covers the fields of education and training, research, studies, scientific activities, seminars, workshops, and consultations in the preparation of DPR RI's statements on Constitutional Court cases. The collaboration also includes data sharing, open access to research, expert support in legislation, budgeting, and supervision functions, capacity building of human resources, and internship programs at the Expert Body of DPR RI.

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., explained that the ongoing FGD is one of the implementations of the cooperation agreed upon between the DPR RI Expert Body and USU. He emphasized the importance of this FGD in hearing presentations from competent speakers on the regulation of strategic commodities in plantations and their processing industries.

 

"The presence of experts, academics, practitioners, and all related parties in this FGD is tangible evidence of our commitment to collaborate in addressing these challenges," said Prof. Muryanto.

 

Through this discussion, it is hoped that comprehensive and applicable policy recommendations can be formulated. For this reason, the USU Rector reminded of the significant challenges faced by this sector, ranging from land management issues, access to technology, to environmental sustainability issues. The plantation sector plays a vital role as a livelihood source for millions of farmers in Indonesia and as a contributor to national foreign exchange earnings.

 

"Activities like this are very important and beneficial in our joint efforts to find the best solutions for regulating strategic commodities in plantations and their processing industries," said Prof. Muryanto.

 

The Head of the DPR RI expert body, Dr. Inosentius Samsul, S.H., M.Hum., stated that the signing of the MoU and MoA is an extension of the previous cooperation. He mentioned that this collaboration includes support for the legislative process at the DPR RI expert body, as well as internship and research programs for students.

 

"Yes, this is an extension of the MoU signed between the DPR RI Expert Body and Universitas Sumatera Utara. Of course, the extension is based on the belief that this cooperation is very important and beneficial," he said.

 

Discussion topics in the FGD can vary depending on the region and specific needs. Dr. Inosentius Samsul, S.H., M.Hum. highlighted that USU excels in agricultural and plantation research, so the ongoing FGD discusses strategic commodities. He hopes students participate in such activities to learn critical thinking and understand the policy-making process in Indonesia.
