"We want to see the condition of the infrastructure arrangement which began at the beginning of the year until now, it is hoped that the construction will be completed according to the specified time," said Muryanto.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si reviewed the infrastructure development in several faculties, Monday (11/15/2021). The review is to ensure the progress that has been carried out by the faculty.

Going around the faculty on a trail bike, the Rector wanted to ensure that the development in each faculty complies with the principles of a green campus and environmentally friendly facilities for lecturers and students to use.

"We want to see the condition of the infrastructure arrangement which began at the beginning of the year until now, it is hoped that the construction will be completed according to the specified time," he said.

The visits to these faculties were not only to see directly the development progress, but also to increase the relationship between university leaders and the dean.

"We hope that through this review we will also hear input from the dean about the conditions in the faculty," he added.

The Rector emphasized that the construction of the facility will also include a garden that will be made for open classrooms.

"These parks can be used as a place for students to study, discuss, and create a new atmosphere that is comfortable and certainly beautiful," he added.

Dr. Muryanto said the development target would be completed in the next five years. Accompanied by Vice Rector V Ir. Luhut Sihombing, MP, and Head of the Asset and Business Management Bureau of USU Suhardi, the rector's visit began with the Faculty of Cultural Sciences, then continued to the Faculty of Economics and Business, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, and Faculty of Engineering.
