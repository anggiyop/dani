USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: Based on Law Number 12 of 2012 Article 35 (3) there are four Compulsory Curriculum Subjects (MKWK) for higher education that must be applied. The four compulsory subjects are Religion, Pancasila (Nation Ideology), Civics (Citizenship), and Indonesian Language. These compulsory subjects are expected to shape the character of students.

The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said that the implementation of the MKWK can be a medium for shaping the personality and character of students at USU. This was conveyed at the online MKWK Discussion Meeting, Friday (9/7/2021).

“USU as a higher education institution must be able to apply the mandate stated in the law regarding MKWK. MKWK shows the importance of these courses to be taught to students," the USU Rector said.

Furthermore, he wanted the obligation to hold the MKWK to have a real impact on the character building of students. According to him, the MKWK learning method that has been running so far needs to be reviewed.

“The MKWK learning process so far needs to be evaluated. We must formulate how this MKWK has a real impact in shaping the personality of students. So as a result, students do get applicable MKWK knowledge,” he said.

MKWK is expected to be able to transform from a learning process that emphasizes theory into learning that is more adaptive and can be practiced by students. According to him, this transformation can improve students' understanding.

“Currently, we can no longer only provide MKWK in theory. We have to create this MKWK that can be implemented by students in their lives. Tridarma's adaptation must be harmonized with this MKWK learning so that it is sustainable," he said.

He described the four fields of science MKWK must teach science in accordance with the times. He gave an example that Pancasila education is expected not only to discuss Pancasila values, but far from that, students are encouraged to actively participate in implementing these values.

"Like religious studies, so far we are theoretical; in the future we must teach students the form of applying religious knowledge in life, such as tolerance between religious communities. We can also apply the thematic religious learning, for example, where an issue is discussed and studied and then linked to religion,” he explained.

At the end of his directions, Muryanto Amin emphasized the importance of MKWK to create student characters who have high tolerance. In addition, it is also important for students to be active in preventing radicalism, and also to form students who have good ethics.

The meeting was attended by USU's Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH., MA., the Deans of Faculty of Law, Faculty of the Social and Political Sciences, Faculty of Cultural Sciences, and the Rector's Expert Staff of the USU. (RR/YH-©ULC)
