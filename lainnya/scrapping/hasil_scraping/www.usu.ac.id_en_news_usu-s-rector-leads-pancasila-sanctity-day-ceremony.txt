Yes, as in the pledge read earlier, all of us ASN and all parts of government organizations, especially Indonesian citizens, can maintain the sovereignty of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia," said Pak Doli.

USU PR- Commemorating the Pancasila Miracle Day, the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a ceremony in the USU Central Administration Bureau Building field on Sunday (01/10/23).

The ceremony to commemorate Pancasila Sanctity Day involved the entire academic community (USU), both from lecturers and other teaching staff.

Director of the Directorate of Achievements, Student Affairs, and Alumni of USU(DITMAWA) USU, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE, M.Si, said that the Pancasila Pledge of Allegiance read during the ceremony should be a reference for Indonesian citizens in maintaining the sovereignty of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia.

Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE, M.Si also said the presence of all USU staff at this ceremony was proof of Universitas Sumatera Utara in increasing the sense of nationalism.

"The presence of all the Universitas Sumatera Utara staff today shows a commitment to that," said Doli.

On another occasion, he expressed hope after commemorating the Pancasila Sanctity Day ceremony. He hopes this commemoration can improve the discipline of all academicians at the Universitas Sumatera Utara.

"If we talk about commitment (meaning), we talk about discipline, God willing, warnings like this can improve the discipline of all the academic community at the Universitas Sumatera Utara," he concluded.
