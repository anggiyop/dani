As a Legal Entity State University (PTN BH) with a majority of Muslim academic community, USU recognizes the importance and obligation of zakat. Prof. Fidel expressed his belief that all Muslims at USU have paid their zakat, especially during Ramadhan.

USU PR — The Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), Sp.O.G., Subsp. F.E.R. participated in and took part in an event to distribute zakat organized by the North Sumatra Provincial Government (Pemprov Sumut). The zakat distribution involved various institutions in the province, including universities, and occurred at the Raja Inal Siregar Hall on Wednesday (Apr. 4).

 

As a Legal Entity State University (PTN BH) with a majority of Muslim academic community, USU recognizes the importance and obligation of zakat. Prof. Fidel expressed his belief that all Muslims at USU have paid their zakat, especially during Ramadhan.

 

"InshaAllah, we are all confident that the culture of giving zakat has been embraced by all Muslims in Universitas Sumatera Utara, including students and educators," he said.

 

Prof. Fidel also emphasized that zakat, linguistically, means purity, blessings, and growth, while in terms of its definition, it refers to giving from one's wealth. Zakat maintains a connection with the Creator and fosters good relationships among human beings.

 

"So, it is an obligatory pillar. Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam," he stated.

 

During the event, the Acting Governor of North Sumatra, Major General TNI (Ret.) Hasanudin mentioned that the regional chapter of the National Zakat Agency (Baznas) has been improving the distribution of zakat in Medan over time. He also conveyed his hope that the givers and receivers of zakat would be blessed during this holy month.

 

"Hopefully, our awareness as givers and receivers will increase. May the givers find peace and the receivers find happiness," he conveyed.
