"We direct students and lecturers to collaborate in conducting research or community service that can support efforts to reduce stunting in North Sumatra," said Prof. Poppy.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Population and Family Planning Agency (BKKBN) of North Sumatra to reduce stunting rates.

Held at the Emerald Garden Hotel, Medan, Monday (1/17/2022), the activity entitled Assistance in Formulating the Grand Design for Population Development (GDPK) 5 Pillars: Formation of a Coordination Team for the Preparation and Implementation of GDPK 5 pillars of the Preparation of the GDPK Activity Plan was also carried out MoU by the North Sumatra BKKBN with universities in North Sumatra, Pegadaian, and other partners.

USU Vice Rector III, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., Apt, said the stunting reduction program would be collaborated with the Merdeka Learning Program at the Merdeka Campus.

"We direct students and lecturers to collaborate in conducting research or community service that can support efforts to reduce stunting in North Sumatra," Prof. Poppy said.

Acting Head of the BKKBN Representative for North Sumatra Province Dra. Rabiatun Adawiyah MPHR, explained that the agency is currently given the mandate to make efforts to reduce stunting rates.

"The Central BKKBN has been entrusted by President Joko Widodo to be the coordinator in efforts to reduce stunting in Indonesia. Because it has been determined, it will automatically go down to all BKKBN in the region. And today we invite and expect assistance from all parties in North Sumatra to help with this program," she said.

She said that the role of universities is very important in this regard. According to her, universities as academic areas can carry out scientific activities in order to find the right solution in reducing stunting rates.

"We invite the cooperation of universities in North Sumatra based on the commitments that have been conveyed by the rectors in the Indonesian Rectors Forum (FRI). The commitment is clear to accelerate the reduction of stunting," she continued.

Rabiatun said the stunting rate in Indonesia was still relatively high, likewise, with the stunting rate specifically in North Sumatra. This phenomenon is the basis for rapid efforts to achieve the target set in 2024.

“In general, the stunting rate in Indonesia is 27% in 2020. The President has instructed that by 2024 the stunting rate in Indonesia will reach 14%. Meanwhile, in 2020 for North Sumatra, it recorded 29% stunting, and decreased to 25% in 2021. We are optimistic that we can lower this figure below the national target in 2024. The governor himself has instructed to reach the 11% figure," she concluded. (©ULC)
