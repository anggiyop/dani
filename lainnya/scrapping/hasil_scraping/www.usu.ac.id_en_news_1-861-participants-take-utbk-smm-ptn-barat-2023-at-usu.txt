As one of the 25 PTN BKS Barat universities, 1,301 participants placed USU as their first choice, and 1,309 participants placed USU as their second choice.

Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Computer-Based Written Test for the 2023 Independent Selection for State Universities (SMM PTN) path Monday (3/7/2023). It was attended by 1,861 participants, who will compete for a quota of 10 percent of the 40 percent capacity of the SMM pathway provided by USU, or a total capacity of 2,137 seats. The selection will last until July 5, 2023.

This selection is organized by universities that are BKS-PTN Indonesia Western (Barat) Region members. As one of the 25 PTN BKS Barat universities, 1,301 participants placed USU as their first choice, and 1,309 participants placed USU as their second choice.

USU provides 18 exam rooms spread across 3 locations, namely in the Information Systems Center (PSI) building, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FASILKOMTI), and Faculty of Engineering (FT).

UTBK implementation is held in two separate sessions: session 1, which starts at 07.30 WIB, and session 2, which starts at 13.15 WIB. The material given in the UTBK questions consists of Scholastic Tests, Indonesian Literacy Tests, English Literacy, and Mathematical Reasoning. The results of the UTBK SMM PTN Barat selection will be announced on July 18, 2023.

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, directly reviewed the first day of UTBK SMM PTN Barat 2023 implementation in two exam locations, namely the Fasilkom and PSI Buildings.

The Rector hopes the exam can run smoothly until the last day.

"I have seen the conditions. Alhamdulillah, it is going well and smoothly, with no significant technical problems. Insha Allah, this condition can be maintained until July 5. Hopefully, everything goes as we expect. PTN SMM Barat has 25 universities that carry it out together so that participants can choose one of the study programs from these 25 universities according to their wishes," said the USU Rector.

Regarding improving the governance and quality assurance system applied in the 2023 selection, Prof. Muryanto emphasized that the Standard Operational Guidelines (POB) and the assessment application system followed those suggested by the Director General of the Ministry of Education and Culture and the KPK.

"The improved governance has been consulted. The admission system is also transparent and has been uploaded to the SMM-PTN admission web. We all hope that everything can run smoothly, there are no obstacles, according to what we want together," said Prof. Muryanto.

Currently, the SMM PTN-Barat 2023 Committee uses the CEEB (College Entrance Examination Board) method for assessing the UTBK results of SMM PTN-BARAT 2023. Each Rector of the PTN Barat has the authority and responsibility to determine passing standards based on UTBK scores obtained by participants following the applicable regulations. The scores of all participants in the same choice are ranked from the highest to the lowest. Per the PTN's applicable provisions, the Rector will determine who will pass based on the UTBK score results in SMM PTN-BARAT 2023. Twenty-five state universities in the BKS-PTN Western region participate in UTBK simultaneously. (RJ)
