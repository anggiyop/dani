To enhance the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) Program, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) continues to build partnerships and collaborate with various stakeholders. Most recently, USU has partnered with PTPN III to bolster the MBKM program initiated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Kemendikbudristek).

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, who initiated the collaboration, stated that USU and PTPN III have signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at strengthening institutional ties between the two parties.

“The focus is on collaborative activities in education, research, and community service,” he said on Monday (June 28).

The MoU, signed by USU Rector and PTPN III President Director Mohammad Abdul Ghani on Tuesday (June 15) in Jakarta, includes detailed technical implementations of the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka Program, particularly in research, development, and innovation.

It also encompasses the utilization and optimization of assets, campaigns on national character and civilization, and other mutually agreed areas. The memorandum is valid for five years.

The Rector expressed hope that this collaboration would further solidify the implementation of the MBKM Program currently being carried out at USU.

“Collaboration with PTPN III is particularly significant for the development of the Agriculture and Forestry Study Programs,” he added.

USU is actively implementing the MBKM Program. Current initiatives include developing MBKM guidebooks, curriculum restructuring, expanding industry partnerships, student internship programs, and preparing 10 study programs to serve as MBKM pilot projects.

The Rector emphasized that the MBKM Program at USU must also align with and meet university ranking assessment indicators while supporting USU’s goal of becoming a world-class university.

“In line with our tagline, we must transform to excel in all aspects. Transformation Toward the Ultimate,” he affirmed.
