“The presence of speakers from NASA is clear evidence that global collaboration is the key to supporting innovation and scientific progress,” said Prof. Poppy.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), through the Integrated Research Laboratory Unit organized Webinar Series 22, entitled “Material Failure Analysis.” It took place online through the Zoom Meeting platform on Tuesday (03/12/2024).

 

This webinar presented the main speaker, Gabriel Demeneghi, a Materials Engineer from The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), United States. His presence is a special moment that strengthens USU's international connections in the fields of science and technology.

 

This webinar began with remarks from Prof. Dr. Apt. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si. as USU Vice Rector III, who stated that this webinar is a strategic step for USU to broaden its horizons and build global collaborations to support the advancement of science and innovation.

 

“The presence of resource persons from NASA is clear evidence that global collaboration is the key to supporting innovation and scientific progress,” said Prof. Poppy.

 

In line with that, Dr. Ir. Rahmi Karolina, S.T., M.T., IPM, GP, as Head of the USU Integrated Research Laboratory, emphasized the importance of material failure analysis in supporting technological innovation in various sectors.

 

“I hope this activity can provide great benefits, not only for academics but also for the industrial world,” he hoped.

 

In his keynote session, Gabriel Demeneghi explained in depth the importance of material failure analysis, especially in high-tech industries such as aerospace. He emphasized that this analysis has an important role in understanding the causes of material damage, preventing fatal accidents, improving efficiency, and extending component life.

 

“The scientific methodologies used in material failure analysis, including case studies from NASA missions, show how material failures can affect the success of space missions,” Gabriel explained.

 

Gabriel Demeneghi also explained the use of advanced technologies, such as electron microscopes and computer-based simulations, to support research and innovation in materials testing. According to him, the science of material failure analysis is relevant to local sectors such as transportation and energy, further enriching the discussion.
