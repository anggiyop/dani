USU PR - Despite using a cane, Nur Sakinah Dwigita, a USU Faculty of Agriculture student enthusiastically participated in the Covid-19 vaccination which was held at the Pancasila Building, Universitas Sumatera Utara, Monday (9/27/2021).

Accompanied by his mother, Artati, the 2017 Food Science and Technology Department student admitted that he was enthusiastic about participating in vaccinations.

“I’m enthusiastic. So that it's easy to go everywhere because now there must be a vaccine certificate, if you want to do research, you also meet a lot of people, right," he explained.

Gita also expressed his hope that face-to-face lectures would soon be implemented, in order to facilitate thesis work for final semester students like himself.

“Because in semester 5 and above in the thesis, we are doing research, so that it runs smoothly," said Gita. Gita recounted that he had a single accident while driving a car that left him injured, so he had to use a crutch. ”I’ve been using a crutch for three weeks and I hope after I get vaccinated it will boost my immune system.” Gita found out information about the Covid-19 vaccine through USU's social media.

In the vaccination activity, the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Dr. Muryanto Amin. S.Sos., M.Si., talked to Gita and gave encouragement so that Gita's injury would recover soon so that the agriculture faculty student could carry out activities as usual.

The Rector also expressed his appreciation for Gita's enthusiasm for taking vaccinations even though she uses a Crutch and is accompanied by her parents. (©ULC)
