This achievement shows the role of SPIRIT Club in increasing interest in sports, especially among students and teenagers. This is very necessary considering that exercise is something that is needed to prevent disease, especially infectious diseases in adulthood. This is also the main aim of establishing the USU SPIRIT Club.
