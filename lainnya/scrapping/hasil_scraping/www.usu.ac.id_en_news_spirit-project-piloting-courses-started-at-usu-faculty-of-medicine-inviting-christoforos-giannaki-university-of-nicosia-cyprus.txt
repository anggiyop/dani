Wellness Integrated Medicine (WIM) is the first SPIRIT Project piloting course at the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara. In studying the topic of this course, Top Scientist speakers were invited to give lectures to students about sports.

This activity was carried out on April 6 2023, at 14.00 WIB to 17.00 WIB for 3 hours. The Top Scientist speaker is Christoforos Giannaki, University of Nicosia, Cyprus, an expert who delivers lecture material in a very interesting way and is based on the research he has carried out. The material topics given are very interesting with discussions on physiological adaptation in response to exercise. This piloting course is an embodiment of the conventional course that has been prepared under the Erasmus Plus funding SPIRIT Project. This lecture was attended by around 65 semester 6 students of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara.

The discussion suggests that at almost any level of integration, the physiological response to exercise or the effects of exercise can be dramatic. This holds true at the cellular, organ, system, and whole organism level even when considering such things as population health, individual health spans, and longevity. This also applies to acute responses to exercise and to the long-term adaptations and physiological and anatomical remodeling that occur in response to exercise training.
