"We will know the steps that must be taken so that we can properly regulate the work system and program planning, we will design it seriously and carefully so that there are no wrong steps," said Prof. Poppy.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatra Utara (USU) held a Sharing Session: Capacity Building Webinar in Higher Education Erasmus+ connected with the Erasmus+ CBHE collaboration opportunity. The webinar was held through a Zoom meeting on Friday (04/02/2022) by presenting the Project Officer of the European Union (EU) Delegation to Indonesia, Destriani Nugroho.

USU Vice-Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Sc., Apt said this information sharing would discuss USU's collaboration project with Erasmus+, as well as registration information and priority topics aimed at the Asian region.

"We will know the steps that must be taken so that we can properly regulate the work system and program planning. We will design it seriously and carefully so that there are no wrong steps," he said.

Thus, according to Prof. Poppy, USU could design the entire work program in detail and on target as Erasmus+ wanted. This Erasmus+ collaboration will also be synergized with USU's vision and mission to realize campus internationalization.

"We will get benefits and additional knowledge, increase knowledge, skills and competencies," he said.

WR III hopes that the opportunity for collaboration with Erasmus+ can also be followed up with various other activities, such as research and community service.

"Don't miss the opportunity to collaborate with Erasmus+," he said.

On the same occasion, European Union Delegation Project Officer Destriani Nugroho said that Erasmus+ is funding by the European Union, especially in research, education, youth, and sports.

"This program is intended for all students and universities," he said.

This Capacity Building program aims to assist universities in partner countries and modernize the higher education system.

"The priority is the needs of universities in partner countries, and increasing the benefit as much as possible to universities in partner countries," added Destriani.
