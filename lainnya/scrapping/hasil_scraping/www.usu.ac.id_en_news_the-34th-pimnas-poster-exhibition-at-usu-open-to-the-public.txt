USU PR – The 34th National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS) at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) on Thursday (October 28, 2021) featured a poster exhibition and a talk show. The poster exhibition displayed 735 posters showcasing scientific products from 8 categories of Student Creativity Programs (PKM) and was open to the public, particularly targeting middle and high school students.

The PKM categories included PKM for Exact Research, PKM for Humanities Research, PKM for Entrepreneurship, PKM for Community Service, PKM for Technological Application, PKM for Creative Initiatives, PKM for Futuristic Constructive Ideas, and PKM for Written Ideas.

 

During the exhibition tour, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin expressed his admiration for the innovative scientific products showcased in the posters. "All the products are excellent. Hopefully, there will be follow-ups and further developments. The products presented in these posters have the potential for downstream applications and commercialization," the Rector said.

The poster assessment by the jury began at 1:00 PM WIB and lasted approximately 90 minutes. The jury team evaluated the posters directly on-site.

Following the judging process, at 4:00 PM WIB, a talk show was held featuring the Rector of USU, the Head of the Puspresnas Jury Board, and the event organizer. The talk show, titled "Tips for Creating Great Posters to Pass PKM," aimed to provide insights and guidance.

"This talk show is also intended to stimulate ideas for what participants can pursue after their PKM," Muryanto said.

The Coordinator of the 34th PIMNAS Poster Exhibition at USU, Ir. Diana Chalil, M.Si., Ph.D., explained that the talk show aimed to ensure that visitors not only enjoyed the exhibition but also gained tips on how to participate in PIMNAS events in the future.

According to Diana, her team had prepared thoroughly, from printing and installation to display arrangement.

"The numerous posters must be displayed in such a way as to create a captivating presentation for both the jury and exhibition visitors," she said.

The PIMNAS poster exhibition also invited university students as well as high school and vocational school students in Medan. It was hoped that visitors would enjoy the exhibition and gain new knowledge.

USU student Ivan Bakara expressed his enthusiasm for visiting the poster exhibition. He believed that the exhibition provided an opportunity for many to see ideas and solutions to current problems.

"From this PIMNAS poster exhibition, I gained a lot of information. The poster presentations are certainly very creative," he said.
