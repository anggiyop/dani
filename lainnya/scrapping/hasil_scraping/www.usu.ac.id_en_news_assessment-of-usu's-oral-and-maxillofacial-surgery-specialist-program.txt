“This opportunity will demonstrate how well-prepared and committed we are to improving service quality and innovation,” he said.

USU PR –The Faculty of Dentistry at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) recently hosted a visit from the Independent Accreditation Institute for Health Higher Education (LAM-PTKes) for an on-site assessment of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Specialist Program (PPDGS). Two LAM-PTKes assessors conducted the assessment, Prof. Dr. Chiquita Prahasanti, drg., Sp. Perio(K), and Prof. Drg. Suryono, S.H., M.M., Ph.D., on Monday, May 6, 2024, at the Nazir Alwi Room of the Faculty of Dentistry.

In his welcoming remarks, USU Vice Rector IV for Information, Planning, and Development, Prof. Dr. Drs. Opim Salim, M.Sc., representing USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., emphasized the importance of demonstrating USU’s readiness and commitment to enhancing quality and innovation in specialist dental education. He also reminded those present that improving the quality of life for patients and the community is the primary goal of any doctor.

“This opportunity will demonstrate how well-prepared and committed we are to improving service quality and innovation,” he said.

Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry, Dr. drg. Essie Octiara, Sp.KGA., Subsp.PKOA(K), explained that the demand from hospital stakeholders and the shortage of oral surgeons, particularly in North Sumatra, were the driving forces behind the establishment of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Specialist Program. The plan to open this program has been in the works since 2010.

“The establishment of this program is a response to the needs of the community and hospital stakeholders who are in dire need of oral surgery specialists in North Sumatra,” she stated.

The dean added that the program has already received visits and support from the Indonesian Collegium of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. If the expected results are achieved following the assessment by LAM-PTKes, the program will be able to accept new students this year.

“There must be an assessment by LAM-PTKes, and if the recommendation is issued before the new student intake, we will start admitting students this year,” she explained.

One of the assessors, Prof. Dr. Chiquita Prahasanti, drg., Sp. Perio(K), noted that at least five faculty members with subspecialist degrees are required to open the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Specialist Program. She expressed her support for the program to be officially established soon and provide services that reach the wider community.

 

“Human resources must meet the minimum standard of five subspecialist faculty members,” she said.Prof. Drg. Suryono, S.H., M.M., Ph.D., another LAM-PTKes assessor, mentioned that their visit aimed to identify and clarify the reports submitted by the Faculty of Dentistry to LAM-PTKes. They will also provide solutions for any areas that need improvement.

“Our task is to identify and clarify,” he said.
