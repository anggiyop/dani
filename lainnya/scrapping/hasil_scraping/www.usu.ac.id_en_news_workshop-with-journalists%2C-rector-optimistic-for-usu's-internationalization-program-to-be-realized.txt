Simply put, according to the former USU FISIP Dean, internationalization is to provide convenience for foreign students to study at USU. As the host, USU must be able to ensure comfort for foreign students to study here.

"Internationalization is that if foreigners study here, they feel comfortable. There will also be foreign lecturers teaching here," said Muryanto.

USU, continued Muryanto, is currently preparing various requirements for this internationalization program. Including breaking through the 500 QS World University Ranking.

"We hope that in the next five years until 2026, we are able to reach 500 QS. That is the achievement," explained Muryanto.

In addition, said Muryanto, USU is currently intensively carrying out development. The development must be carried out to realize the standards required by foreign students later.

"We will get a lot if this internationalization program is realized, for example our country's foreign exchange increases because they pay for everything here, starting from boarding houses, food, until they can tell stories about tourist cities in North Sumatra," said Muryanto.

During the meeting, which took place full of intimacy, Muryanto Amin also listened to various suggestions and input from journalists. Prior to the workshop, sports were conducted with the USU Rector and journalists. ((C)ULC)
