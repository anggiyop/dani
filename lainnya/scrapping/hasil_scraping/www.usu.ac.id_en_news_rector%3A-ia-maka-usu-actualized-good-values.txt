“Clearly, IA MAKA USU characterizes local wisdom in its vision. Local wisdom is one of them, yes, actualizing the good values ​​in every cultural diversity in Indonesia, especially North Sumatra," said the Rector.

USU PR - The Karo Student Alumni Association (IA MAKA USU) held a Gendang Mburo Ate Tedeh event as well as the Inauguration and Inauguration of the Central Executive Board (DPP) of the Karo Student Alumni Association (IA MAKA USU) for the 2022-2027 period at the USU Pancasila Building Hall on Saturday, ( 11/06/2022).

The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos, M.Si said that he hoped and ensured that some of the tasks could be taken over by IA MAKA USU because there is local wisdom in the vision carried out by IA MAKA USU. One of them is to actualize the values ​​of goodness contained in every culture in Indonesia, especially North Sumatra.

“Clearly, IA MAKA USU characterizes local wisdom in its vision. Local wisdom is one of them, yes, actualizing the good values ​​in every cultural diversity in Indonesia, especially North Sumatra," said the Rector.

The Rector believes that many karo cultural values need to be actualized in everyday life. It can be seen from the results of research on Karo local wisdom that can benefit the Karo people and the people of Indonesia.

 "It's been a lot at the level of the thesis to the dissertation. If we translate these values ​​for the community, this can help the campus world," said Muryanto Amin.

He hopes that in the future, the newly inaugurated USU DPP IA MAKA can contribute intense energy to USU's mission to become a World-Class University. It is because there is an assessment indicator regarding academic employees which measures how many USU alumni surveyed by international institutions said that USU was the best.

“I think having intense energy will help USU to become a world-class university. There is one indicator that IA MAKA SA knows about employee academics, the measure is how many USU alumni, when surveyed by international institutions, said that USU is the best. All alumni who are members of IAMAKa, we list them in the QS world university ranking assessment, "he said.
