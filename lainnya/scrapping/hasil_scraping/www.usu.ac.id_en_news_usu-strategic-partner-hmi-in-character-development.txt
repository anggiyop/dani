USU's Director of Student and Alumni Achievement, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE., M.Sc. who accompanied the chancellor in the hearing explained, HMI is one of the external organizations at USU that is widely followed by USU students and is USU's strategic partner, especially in developing student character.

The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Sc. received an audience of the Islamic Student Association (HMI) in the Rector's Bureau Audience Room on Wednesday, (31/08/2022).

USU's Director of Student and Alumni Achievement, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE., M.Sc. who accompanied the chancellor in the hearing explained, HMI is one of the external organizations at USU that is widely followed by USU students and is USU's strategic partner, especially in developing student character.

"We advise that in order to add color to the character development of USU students, HMI must show an intellectual organization and have idealism," he said.

Doli hopes that with HMI, USU students are expected to have their own color, especially in promoting intellectual and Islamic characters.

General Chairman of the Coordinating Board (Badko) of HMI Sumatera Utara Abdul Rahman S.Pd., M.Pd said this visit was a form of friendship and at the same time revived the existence of HMI at USU.

"After the hearing, we will build friendships at campuses not only at USU but also at various public and private universities so that we can return HMI bases to campuses," said Abdul Rahman.

This is because HMI has a goal to create academic people who breathe Islam. In addition, the ideals of HMI are in line with the mission of the university.

Abdul Rahman said that the Rector of USU had a good view of HMI and was pleased to assist HMI's activities at USU so that this would allow the combination of USU and HMI.(©ULC)
