USU Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K) said that this theme aligns with USU's mission and goals in making students moral and intellectual people from Indonesian civil society. In addition, it is also expected to produce innovative research that is useful in advancing public welfare and educating the nation's life.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) attended and appreciated the 72nd anniversary of the Bukit Barisan Military Regional Command I (Kodam I) with the theme "Together with the People, Building the Nation". The event was held at the Wisma Benteng Building on Monday (20/06/2022).

USU Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K) said that this theme aligns with USU's mission and goals in making students moral and intellectual people from Indonesian civil society. In addition, it is also expected to produce innovative research that is useful in advancing public welfare and educating the nation.

"I am grateful for officially inviting USU to attend the 72nd anniversary of the Bukit Barisan Military Command I," he said.

The Commander of the Regional Military Command (Pangdam) I Bukit Barisan (BB) Major General TNI Achmad Daniel Chardin said that this theme is a reminder for soldiers that threats to destroy the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI) are not visible. One of the main keys is maintaining and strengthening peace between the TNI and the people.

"With the existing theme, soldiers must be able to maintain and strengthen peace between the TNI and the people," he said.

With this theme, activities related to and involving the interests of the people were carried out, such as social services, namely the distribution of necessities and blood donations, as well as volleyball, soccer, executive shooting, and sniper competitions as well as golf, tennis, and equestrian competitions.

"All activities involve the people and are carried out best for the people," he continued.

Pangdam I hope that this event can be a moment of reflection and evaluation of the struggles carried out to maintain the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia, especially in northern Sumatra.

All soldiers are expected to maintain the excellent name of Kodam I Bukit Barisan through real work that is beneficial to the community, nation, and state. Besides, avoiding various violations could make people distrust the soldiers and civil servants of Kodam I Bukit Barisan to maintain the integrity of the Republic of Indonesia.

"I hope that all soldiers will maintain the people's trust in the Bukit Barisan Military Command I to maintain the integrity of the Republic of Indonesia," he said.
