Muhammad Dava Warsyahdhana, a 2017 student of the Department of Agrotechnology, the Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), was selected to be one of those inaugurated by the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Ir. H. Joko Widodo online, as the Millennial Farmer Ambassador of the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, Friday (8/6/2021). The President, accompanied by the Indonesian Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Syahrul Yasin Limpo, SH, M.Si.,M, confirmed Dava with the Millennial Farmers Ambassadors (DPM) and other Mainstay Farmers Ambassadors (DPA) to become the driving force for millennial farmers in the regions.

Contacted by telephone, Muhammad Dava recounted how he was initially chosen as the Millennial Farmer Ambassador.According to Dava, the selection process he went through in selecting the Millennial Farmer Ambassador was very strict because there were several criteria that were assessed.“Alhamdulillah, Dava is very grateful to be confirmed as part of the Millennial Farmer Ambassador of the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture.This achievement was not due to one's own efforts, but to the blessing of Allah SWT, the prayers of parents, family, lecturers, and friends who always support and provide motivation, "Dava said.

The millennial generation is Indonesia's demographic bonus which is continuously empowered by the government, one of which is in the agricultural sector.Millennial Farmer Ambassadors (DPM) aged 17-39 years and Mainstay Farmers Ambassadors (DPA) aged 39 years and over.This DPM/DPA was formed by the Ministry of Agriculture with the aim of increasing the role of the younger generation in developing and advancing the agricultural sector.DPM and DPA have very varied business fields such as horticulture cultivation, food crop cultivation, livestock cultivation, processing of agricultural/livestock/plantation products, agricultural machine tool services to agroedutourism.

Dava is a student figure who is active in agricultural activities and is the founder of a startup known as “Kita Agriculture”.Kita Agriculture is a startup that becomes a forum for agricultural learning to realize the synergy of young Indonesian farmers with the slogan "Grow Hope, Develop Services, Advance the Farmers of Our Country".

We Agriculture, moves through education and approaches with farmers and the community.We Agriculture carries a great vision and mission to realize a more advanced Indonesian agriculture, build strategies, create collaborations and establish cooperation with various stakeholders.We Agriculture has carried out various useful activities, both in the agricultural and social fields.

Starting from anxiety about the agricultural world which often does not get more attention, this is the reason Dava is majoring in agriculture.For him, Indonesia is no less important than its position in the eyes of the world in the world of agriculture.During his time as an agricultural student, Dava has been active in every national to international activity and has won awards in every activity.

Some of the activities he has participated in have resulted in various achievements.Among them;1st Place of the 2018 Indonesian Agricultural Student Scientific Week (PIMPI) at IPB Bogor, 2nd Place of Sriwijaya Scientific Week (PIS) 2018 at UNSRI Palembang, 3rd Place of Business Plan Competition (BPC) 2019 at UNAND Padang, 1st Place of Tanjungpura Medical Scientific Competition (TMSC) 2019 at UNTAN Pontianak, Silver Medal International Festival of Innovation On Green Technology (I-FINOG) 2019 at Universiti Pahang Malaysia, Gold Medal World Invention and Innovation Contest (WIC) 2019 in Seoul, First Grade Excellent World Invention and Innovation Contest (WIC) 2019 in Seoul, to the 2019 Special Award From Asia Invention Creativity World Invention and Innovation Contest (WIC) in Seoul.

He is also often invited to be a resource person at national agricultural forums to share inspirational stories and experiences, either through webinars, radio, online news and TV media.

The Millennial Farmer Ambassador of the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture is a very positive movement to encourage the enthusiasm of young people to enter the world of agriculture, so that they can supervise, seek and encourage farmers to express their aspirations, be it ideas or complaints, so that they can help improve the welfare of farmers.

Ending the conversation, Dava left a message for all Indonesian people, especially the younger generation of their age.“Indonesia is not only defined by map boundaries, but by the movements and roles of young people.Let's increase literacy together, because actually the Indonesian people are not a small-scale nation.Let's be active in organizing, achieving, collaborating, contributing without further ado to create a better and dignified Indonesia," he concluded enthusiastically.
