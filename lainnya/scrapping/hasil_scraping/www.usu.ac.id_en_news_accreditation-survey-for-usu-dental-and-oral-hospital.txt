We hope that this initiative can provide the best results for the accreditation of USU Oral and Dental Hospital and that we can increase public trust in the dental and oral health services and treatments provided by medical personnel and staff, said the First Vice Rector of USU.

HUMAS USU - The Indonesian Accreditation Institute for Health Facilities (LAFKI) conducted a review of the accreditation of the Dental and Oral Hospital (RSGM) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) on April 10 and 11, 2023. This activity was officiated by Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs of USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH, MA, Tuesday (10/04/2023), in the Meeting Room of RSGM, Faculty of Dentistry USU.

This reaccreditation process is an effort by RSGM USU to improve the quality of services the hospital staff provides to the community related to oral health problems. In his remark, USU's First Vice Rector said that this assessment also affects the increasing public trust towards USU's RSGM.

“We hope that this initiative can provide the best results for the accreditation of USU Oral and Dental Hospital and that we can increase public trust in the dental and oral health services and treatments provided by medical personnel and staff,” said the First Vice Rector of USU.

RSGM USU will be transformed into a type B hospital. Therefore, there is a proposal concerning the relocation of the hospital. In response, Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH, MA, stated that RSGM USU had formulated a master plan regarding hospital development.

“[The roadmap] has already been made. A master plan has been prepared for the development of the dental and oral hospital,” he said.

Furthermore, he explained that this assessment is a starting point for making a professional RSGM USU with maximum service. The Vice Rector I hopes that this assessment will bring the best results for RSGM USU.

“We hope, Insha'Allah, with the ease given by Allah and the generosity of the LAFKI surveyors, we can get a perfect (score) accreditation, Insha'Allah,” he added.

RSGM USU alone has made various preparations in order to prepare for this assessment. Starting from documents, and improvement of systems, to infrastructure. Director of RSGM USU drg. Rahmi Syaflida Dalimunthe, Sp.BM (K) admitted that a number of things were done solely to provide the best service to the community.

“First, we carry out accreditation to improve the quality of service. Of course, then we also improve the hospital's facilities, infrastructure, and systems to provide the best service in Medan,” said the Director of RSGM USU.

It was reported that there were a total of 789 documents examined by the surveyors. The RSGM USU survey was directly conducted by the Chairperson of LAFKI Surveyors, Dr. dr. Ratna Indrawati, Dk. M.Kes., CIQnR, FIHFAA and a member of LAFKI drg. Rahaju Soelistyawati, M.Kes.
