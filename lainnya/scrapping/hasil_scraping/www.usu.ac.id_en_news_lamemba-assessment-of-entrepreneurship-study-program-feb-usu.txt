"This will be an evaluation reference as well as an indicator of the success of the work program implementation. Including curriculum changes and entrepreneurship course designs that support accreditation achievements," explained Vice Rector 1 USU.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) again received a visit from the Institute for Self-Accreditation of Business Management Economics and Accounting (LAMEMBA) in the context of a field assessment of the Undergraduate Program in Entrepreneurship, Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) which took place at the Prof. Dr. Soehadji Hadibroto FEB USU Hall on Wednesday to Saturday, (02-05/08/2023).

M.Si from Universitas Kristen Maranatha and Dr. T. Meldi Kusuma, SE. MM from Universitas Syiah Kuala.

“We would like to express our gratitude and welcome to the LAMEMBA Assessment Team, who are pleased to attend this assessment, as part of the implementation of accreditation activities,” said Dr. Edy.

The Entrepreneurship Study Program is known to have just opened in 2021.
