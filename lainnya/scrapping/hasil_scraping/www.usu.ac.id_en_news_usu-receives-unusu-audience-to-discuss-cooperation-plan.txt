“We will prepare programs such as assistance so that UNUSU can prepare for future accreditation, then for lecturers who are lacking, we will discuss items that we can support,” explained the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an audience with the Universitas Nadhlatul Ulama Sumatera Utara (UNUSU) in order to establish cooperation for joint campus development. This activity was held in the Rector's Audience Room, USU Central Administration Bureau Building, on Wednesday (07/02/2024).

In the development effort, USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si said the need to design a plan that can be prioritized first in order to help UNUSU gradually including making public lectures, offering joint research for UNUSU lecturers which will then create collaboration between USU and UNUSU lecturers.

“We will prepare programs such as assistance so that UNUSU can prepare for future accreditation, then for lecturers who are lacking, we will discuss items that we can support,” explained the USU Rector.

Dr. Ibnu Affan, SH, M.Hum, as Rector of UNUSU, said that he would focus on making a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) first, which would then continue to prepare for accreditation of the Nutrition, Health, and Computer Science Study Programs with guidance from USU in order to get better results.

The Rector of UNUSU hopes for support from USU in the form of Human Resources (HR) considering the UNUSU Nutrition Science Study Program has a shortage of lecturers as well as support for infrastructure so as to create a good working environment between the two parties.

“We hope that in the future there will be human resources and facilities and infrastructure from USU that can be used by UNUSU because there are still limitations that UNUSU has,” said Dr. Ibnu Affan, SH., M.Hum. in his interview.UNUSU Vice Rector III, Hendra, MPd asked for guidance from USU regarding how to overcome the uneven number of students in several study programs so that input is needed to improve student equity in 13 other study programs.

Dean of UNUSU's Faculty of Communication Mardiah, S. Kom, M. Kom, hopes to cooperate regarding computer laboratories with USU and the cooperation of Merdeka Belajar Kampus Mederka (MBKM) such as carrying out exchanges between USU and UNUSU so that there is a transfer of knowledge and guidance on the new curriculum that can be implemented at UNUSU.
