The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a competition to commemorate Indonesia's 77th Independence Day. The competition was held at the Pancasila Building on Monday (8/15/2022).

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a competition to commemorate Indonesia's 77th Independence Day. The competition was held at the Pancasila Building on Monday (8/15/2022).

It is known that apart from celebrating the 77th Anniversary of the Republic of Indonesia, this competition is also close to the celebration of USU's 70th Anniversary. So, starting from the academic community, employees, lecturers, to educators are involved as participants in the competition.

Dean of FISIP Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., MSP when he was one of the participants of the competition, explained that the competitions in this event were a variety of typical 17's competitions that were often encountered on every August 17 celebration, including tug of war competitions, karaoke competitions, sacks racing competitions, inserting nail-in-bottle competitions, and more.

"As far as I know, there are tug of war competitions, karaoke, competitions, sack races, put nails in bottles," said Dr. Hatta.

On that occasion Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., MSP advised the USU academic community that the commemoration on August 17 could increase the love for the homeland and a sense of nationalism, in addition to increasing the sense of unity and integrity so that they are not easily divided.

"This August 17, we as USU's academic community are equally increasing the love for the homeland, a sense of nationalism, and the sense of unity and oneness should not be easily divided by differences," he said.

The Dean of USU's FISIP also said that the academic community from the education sector would help the government in realizing the theme of RI's 77th Anniversary, namely "Recover Faster, Rise Stronger" (©ULC)
