“We expect that with this cooperation and support from the Secretary-General, USU will become more recognized by universities across India, thus facilitating easier collaboration,” Prof. Poppy said.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) continues to broaden its international partnerships. This was highlighted by a courtesy visit from the Indian Consul General, warmly received by USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., at the USU Rector’s Office on Monday, April 29, 2024.

 

During the meeting, USU Vice Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., noted that the collaboration between USU and India has been established for some time. An example of this is the Erasmus project involving three Indian universities. Additionally, USU is expecting a professor from the European Economic Community (EEC) in the near future.

 

Prof. Poppy expressed hope that this cooperation, supported by the Indian Consulate General, would increase USU's recognition among Indian universities and facilitate collaboration.

 

“We expect that with this cooperation and support from the Secretary-General, USU will become more recognized by universities across India, thus facilitating easier collaboration,” Prof. Poppy said.

 

In agreement, Indian Consul General Mr. Ravi Shanker Goel stated that the purpose of his visit was to meet with the rector to discuss new cooperation and technical collaboration between USU and the Indian Consulate General. A recent development includes an Indian professor joining USU for teaching.

 

“My purpose in visiting is to meet the rector and create new cooperation and technical collaboration between USU,” Mr. Goel said.

 

Mr. Goel also explained the reasons for choosing USU as a partner. He noted that USU is one of the best universities in Indonesia, with a strong global ranking and is the largest university in North Sumatra. Furthermore, USU has many advanced departments and technologies. Mr. Goel mentioned that he observed the high enthusiasm for learning among USU students during his visit, which makes him optimistic about the success of this partnership, as USU showed strong support and warm reception during the initial meeting.
