In the Wellness Integrated Medicine (WIM) Course pilot project which was held at the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara, a Top Scientist Lecture was held by Rita Cordovil from the University of Lisbon, Portugal. The SPIRIT Project under Erasmus Plus funding has produced a conventional course which this year has been implemented at USU.

Rita Cordovil is a reliable researcher who discusses children's motor development. In this WIM Course, it discusses motor development, namely physical growth which is marked by the strengthening of bones, muscles, and the child's ability to move and explore their environment. Motor development itself occurs gradually and continuously according to age and stimulation from an early age. Gross motor skills are the child's ability to control body movements using the large muscles in their arms, legs and body to make movements such as crawling, walking, jumping, kicking or lifting things.

The top scientist lecture will be held on May 3rd, 2023 from 14.00 WIB to 17.00 WIB in the 6th semester student lecture hall of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara. The lecture was very interesting and was attended by 65 students interspersed with live question and answer sessions. It is hoped that this course will provide understanding and a direct link between children's motor development and physical activity during childhood which will grow into adulthood.
