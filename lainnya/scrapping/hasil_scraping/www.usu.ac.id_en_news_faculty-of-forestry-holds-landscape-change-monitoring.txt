MEDAN-PR: The Forest Management Laboratory of the USU Faculty of Forestry in collaboration with ESRI Indonesia held a Training on Monitoring and Evaluation of Regional Landscape Changes with ArcGis Pro and ArcGis Online, August 11-12, 2023, at the Ibis Styles Hotel Medan.

Spatial-based training is one of the programs of the Forest Management Laboratory of the USU Faculty of Forestry. Along with the need for spatial analysis and significant utilization of GIS in various fields of life, the need for training in the use of GIS software is urgent. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology facilitates the management of geospatial data by providing a means of processing and analyzing data to produce comprehensive and up-to-date information.

The participants in this training received several facilities that made the training effective. These facilities include training materials, trial ArcGIS Pro software that can be used fully for 1 month, a training kit, a training certificate, a coffee break, and lunch. This training can improve the ability and provide more knowledge to participants in the context of software mastery and ArcGIS implementation, especially for work and research activities. (RJ/Agus)
