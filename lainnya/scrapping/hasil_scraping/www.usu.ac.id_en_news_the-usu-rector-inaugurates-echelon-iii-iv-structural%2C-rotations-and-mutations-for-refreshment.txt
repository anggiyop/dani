The Rector of USU said this inauguration is a form of rotation and mutation to refresh employees who must have a new and different work atmosphere. The Rector believes that all employees have a commitment to carry out their duties and positions better.

USU PUBLIC RELATIONS - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Sc., inaugurated Echelon III and IV Structural Officials at the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Wednesday (9/29/2021) at the USU Central Administration Bureau Building.

The Rector of USU said this inauguration was a form of rotation and mutation to refresh employees with a new and different working atmosphere. The Rector believes that all employees commit to carry out their duties and positions better.

"Sometimes the demands of work require a fast rhythm and adjustment, so that every job has consequences to determine whether we move forward, walk in place or go backward," the USU Rector said.

The Rector emphasized that the work carried out by Echelon III and IV Structural Officials was at the middle management level. This level determines the wishes of superiors and subordinates' abilities, so they can take tactical and detailed steps to implement the program.

“This is the importance of middle-level management, which determines the success or failure of a program. These officials must be able to combine what the leader wants and know the abilities of the subordinates who will do the work," said the Rector.

In addition, the Rector advised that inaugurated officials must understand the performance targets in their fields, all of which must be carefully planned and implemented.

“Officials must know what the performance targets in that field are. Read the document properly, then translate the technical stuff and what to do. The leadership will not be able to get results if you do not understand what the target is," the Rector added.

The Rector also gave tricks to officials to advance as professional ASN, one of which was always holding hands with other people. "Walk side by side with your friends so they can share opinions and discuss what we do," he said. The Rector congratulated the inaugurated officials on the occasion.

“Without your contributions, this university will not be able to progress. Contribute our thoughts and energy to the place where we work, the institution of our hope. Have a good work, have a great creativity for the progress of USU," the Rector said. (©ULC)
