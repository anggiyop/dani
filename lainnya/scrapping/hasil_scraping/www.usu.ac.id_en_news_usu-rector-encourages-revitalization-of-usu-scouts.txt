"We definitely hope that USU Scouts can take further action. The existing activities so far can be improved. I hope that the participation of USU Scouts in community development, competitions, or routine training can be maximized," the USU Rector said.

He emphasized that the revitalization of the USU Scouts was an important thing to do. USU Scouts revitalization is interpreted as an effort to transform to be better than before. He also invited USU Scouts to collaborate in the implementation of USU programs.

“USU Scouts must transform for the better. Arrange a work program, agree on it together and later we can review. I hope that the work program can be in line with the USU program, so that we can collaborate and synergize," he said.

Welcoming this, Head of the Medan City Front Group 08.138, Dr. Prawidya Hariani said that USU Scouts were launching the Village Assistance Scout program. This is an implementation of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education and also the Tri Bina in scouting education.

"We also convey here that the USU Scouts launched the Village Assistance Scout program. Recently, we have also conducted a survey to villages in Langkat Regency so that we can explore them. In accordance with the USU program, there we also plan to digitize the village," Prawidya mentioned.

She also added that so far USU Scouts have carried out a series of activities. Competition activities, training, and community service are common things that have been carried out by USU Scouts. Currently, USU Scouts are accompanying Kutambelin Village, Namanteran District, Karo Regency.

The USU Rector also advised USU Scouts to maximize USU's potential to carry out activities. He stated that USU has two campuses in Kwala Bekala which can be used as a place for scouting activities.

In addition, she said that routine scouting activities are needed to maintain the spirit and cohesiveness. According to him, the pandemic is not an obstacle for USU Scouts to carry out activities. On the contrary, it becomes a space to be able to innovate and increase self-potential.
