National Achievement-Based Selection (SNBP) Student Program

About SNBP

SNBP (National Selection Based on Achievement) is a substitute for SNMPTN (National Selection for State Higher Education Institution Entrance), which is no longer held nationally by the Institute for Higher Education Institution Entrance Test (LTMPT) but its role is continued by the Technical Implementation Unit of the Center for Educational Testing Management (BP3). In the SNBP pathway, prospective students are emphasized to have holistic and cross-disciplinary competencies. In the 2024/2025 Academic Year, students who obtain an SMA/MA/SMK diploma and show high academic achievement are entitled to choose to continue their education at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) both in the undergraduate and diploma programs. The SNBP registration stages in 2025 are expected to be the same as in previous years, although the details are still subject to change in accordance with the SNBP committee policy. The registration stage begins with filling in the prospective students’ private data through the official SNBP website (https://snpmb.bppp.kemdikbud.go.id) and personal data according to the instructions provided. Make sure the data entered is correct and complete. After filling in the personal data, you will enter the education payment stage. Payments can be made through banks or online payment services that have been appointed by the SNBP committee. Follow the procedure that has been told carefully.

Currently, USU provides at least 20% of the total capacity of undergraduate and diploma programs through the SNBP pathway. The 2025 SNBP schedule starts from 28 December 2024 for the process of determining eligible/quota students, then on 06 January - 31 January 2025 filling in PDSS (School and Student Database), then on 04 - 18 Februari 2025 is the SNBP registration period. The selection results will be announced on 18 Maret 2025.
