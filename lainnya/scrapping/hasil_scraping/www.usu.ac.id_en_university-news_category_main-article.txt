Coordinating Minister for PMK Planting Trees at USU

Muhadjir explained that the real action of planting trees at USU was a joint effort to raise awareness in the campus community about the importance of maintaining the environment and cleanliness for a healthy life. “Planting a tree requires more effort than cutting it down. Planting trees and caring for them can take 40 years, but cutting them only takes 10 minutes,” he said.
