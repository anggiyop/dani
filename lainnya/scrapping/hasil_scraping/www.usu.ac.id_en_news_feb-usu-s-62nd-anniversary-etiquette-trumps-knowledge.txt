There have been numerous contributions from FEB USU alumni to society, especially at the Universitas Sumatera Utara, as well as at the national and international levels, stated Dr. Edy.

USU PR- The Faculty of Economics and Business at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) celebrated the culmination of its 62nd Anniversary with a fun walk. Titled "Ethics and Knowledge" and accompanied by the movement "Kolaborasi Industri-Akademisi untuk pertumbuhan Ekonomi dan Bisnis yang berkelanjutan" (Industry-Academia Collaboration for Sustainable Economic and Business Growth), the event took place at the FEB USU Courtyard on Saturday(12/02/2023)

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., Vice Rector I for Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, and Alumni of USU, on behalf of USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., appreciated the special momentum of the 62nd Anniversary of the USU Faculty of Economics and Business. This 62nd anniversary marks a long journey of success and dedication by FEB USU and its alumni.

"There have been numerous contributions from FEB USU alumni to society, especially at the Universitas Sumatera Utara, as well as at the national and international levels," Dr. Edy expressed.

In USU's strategic plan, Dr. Edy explained that their primary focus is internationalization. Therefore, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., hoped that FEB USU could serve as a locomotive to enter the international arena. As such, the design of programs in FEB should incorporate international elements, including international classes and initiatives to develop joint degree and double degree programs with foreign universities.

"We aim to go beyond international accreditation and achieve global recognition," Dr. Edy clarified.

Dean of FEB USU, Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si., emphasized that this program involves students. He also highlighted students' behavior by reminding them that etiquette should precede knowledge. The series of celebration events involved students and showed support for student organizations. One new initiative was the organization of the first-ever job fair as part of the anniversary celebration.

"We also involve students, including the active involvement of student organizations. We encourage them to carry out various activities," Dr. Fadli stated.

In commemorating FEB USU's Anniversary, Dr. Fadli, S.E., and M.Si. chose a theme with great promise. The theme carries the message that the knowledge acquired will gain deeper strength by instilling values of etiquette and ethics. Because integrity, ethics, and proper conduct play a central role in shaping individuals of quality.

"We have chosen a theme that contains the hope of instilling values, that with etiquette and ethics, the knowledge we acquire will also become stronger," Dr. Fadli conveyed.
