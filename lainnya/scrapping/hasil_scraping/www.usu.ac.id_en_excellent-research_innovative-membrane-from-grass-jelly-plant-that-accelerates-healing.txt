An innovative wound dressing based on chitosan and pectin from grass jelly offers an environmentally friendly solution that is effective in accelerating healing. The findings incorporate natural biopolymers to create a medical product that is sustainable and safe for patients.

The innovation in the medical field is often inspired by nature, and one intriguing example is the development of wound dressings based on natural membranes. Chitosan and pectin, two basic materials long known in the biomedical world, are now being combined in a way that has never been reported before. The presence of pectin extracted from local plants such as Cincau Rambat (Cyclea barbata Miers) opens the door to new, more environmentally friendly, and sustainable solutions. But what makes this innovation so special?

Researchers from Universitas Sumatera Utara, Indonesia, namely Mayang Sari, Prof. Tamrin, Jamaran Kaban, and Zul Alfian, are exploring chitosan and pectin as biopolymer materials. Chitosan is derived from chitin, a polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans. Chitosan has long been known for its excellent antimicrobial properties, its ability to accelerate blood clotting, and its adaptability to various forms and compositions of materials.

On the other hand, pectin is a polysaccharide commonly found in the cell walls of plants, especially in the peels of fruits such as apples and oranges. Pectin is often used in the food industry, but its medical potential has begun to attract attention due to its ability to form gels, retain moisture, and be biodegradable.

The combination of chitosan and pectin offers an ideal blend for wound dressing applications. In this study, pectin extracted from Cincau Rambat was combined with chitosan in various ratios to form membranes that were not only strong but also flexible and effective in maintaining wound moisture. "The pectin extraction process from Cincau Rambat was a crucial point in this research. Without using heat in the process, the resulting pectin retained its natural quality, preserving its chemical structure to remain stable," explained Prof. Tamrin.

The crosslinking between chitosan and pectin ensures that the membrane has strong and stable bonds, while the crystalline structure of pectin from Cincau Rambat provides additional stability, which is essential for medical applications. With high thermal stability, this membrane can withstand challenging conditions without losing its integrity.

Prof. Tamrin also explained that the membrane has exceptional moisture retention capabilities, a critical factor in wound healing. Its high swelling ratio, ideal Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR), and balanced porosity allow it to create a moist environment without becoming too wet—an optimal condition for healing damaged skin tissue. This is crucial because wound dressings that are too dry can slow down the skin regeneration process, while those that are too moist can lead to infections.

But why is this innovation so important? The medical world continues to seek more effective and environmentally friendly solutions for various healthcare needs. Conventional wound dressings are often made from synthetic materials that are not biodegradable, contributing to the growing issue of medical waste. Additionally, some synthetic materials can cause allergic reactions or irritation in patients with sensitive skin. With the arrival of this chitosan/pectin blend membrane, not only is healing efficiency increased, but sustainability and patient safety also become top priorities.

Moreover, natural materials like pectin from Cincau Rambat and chitosan are abundant resources. The use of these materials in medical applications has the potential to reduce dependency on more expensive and difficult-to-process synthetic materials. In the long term, this could lead to lower healthcare costs, especially in regions with limited access to advanced medical technology.

For many people, minor wounds may seem trivial. However, for patients with certain conditions—such as diabetics or those undergoing surgery—wound healing can be a complicated and prolonged process. "Having a wound dressing that not only speeds up healing but also protects against infection is very important. This membrane, with its unique combination, offers new hope for those in need of better healing solutions," said Prof. Tamrin.

The development of medical technology is not only about finding new ways to treat diseases or improve health conditions but also about how those innovations can have a positive long-term impact on society and the environment. With innovations like the chitosan/pectin membrane from Cincau Rambat, we are getting closer to a future where healthcare is not only better but also greener.

Pectin, though often considered a common ingredient in the food industry, demonstrates much greater potential when combined with chitosan for medical purposes. The pectin extraction process from Cincau Rambat highlights the importance of the right approach in preserving the quality and effectiveness of this material. Without heat treatment, the chemical structure of the pectin remains intact, ensuring that all of its bioactive benefits can be maximally integrated into the membrane.

The importance of the mixing ratio between chitosan and pectin cannot be overlooked. Membranes resulting from different ratios provide insights into how small variations in composition can affect the physical and mechanical properties of the final product. "The 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 ratios offer options for researchers and medical practitioners to adjust the needs based on the type of wound and the patient’s condition. This flexibility in formulation allows for the development of more specific and effective products," Prof. Tamrin explained.

This membrane, born from the collaboration between nature and science, offers more than just a technical solution. It reflects humanity’s effort to return to its roots, utilizing the abundant natural resources around us to create solutions that are not only effective but also sustainable and environmentally friendly. In an era where environmental issues are becoming more pressing, approaches like this are becoming more relevant and important.

Beyond its medical benefits, this innovation also reminds us of the importance of preserving and utilizing the biodiversity that nature has to offer. Cincau Rambat, a plant that may be less known to many people, now plays an important role in the medical world. This demonstrates that there is still much untapped potential in nature that we can harness for the good of humanity.

In the future, further development of this chitosan/pectin membrane could lead to the creation of other, more advanced and specific medical products. Imagine wound dressings that not only accelerate healing but can also be customized to the needs of specific patients, such as those with sensitive skin or those prone to infection. Or perhaps membranes equipped with the slow release of active agents, providing continuous therapy throughout the healing process.

With all the potential it holds, the chitosan/pectin membrane from Cincau Rambat has a great chance to become one of the significant innovations in the world of medical care. Over time, with further research and development, we may see broader applications of this technology, not only in wound dressings but also in various other medical products. This is the beginning of something bigger, a step forward in healthcare that is both better and more environmentally friendly, ultimately providing immeasurable benefits to humanity.
