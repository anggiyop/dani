Product Description

These innovations include the development of a method of directly printing electronic circuit lines on circuit boards using solvent-based ink. This product offers several significant advantages:

Ease and speed of printing: This method enables more accessible and faster printing of electronic circuit paths than conventional methods. The process is simple and can be done quickly, saving production time. 
High precision: By using meticulous and accurate oil-based inks, printing electronic circuit lines can achieve a high degree of precision. This ensures good quality and reduces errors in production. 
Multi-design in one print: This method enables printing various electronic circuit line designs in a single print run. This opens up the opportunity to print different product variants or prototypes in a single production run.
Mass scale: One of the critical advantages of this innovation is the ability to perform electronic circuit line printing on a mass scale. This enables efficient production and can meet high demand.

With these advantages, direct printing of electronic circuit lines using oil-based inks is an attractive and potential solution in the electronics industry.
