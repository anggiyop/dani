MEDAN- USU PR: Cooperation between the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and PT Pegadaian is entering a new phase. One of the results of this collaboration was realized by the inauguration of The Gade Creative Lounge at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), located in the USU Library area on Monday (14/2/2022).

The inauguration was attended by the Mayor of Medan Bobby Afif Nasution and his staff, President Director of PT Pegadaian Kuswiyoto, SE, Ak.MBA, The Rector of USU Dr Muryanto Amin, S Sos, M Si, USU Vice-Rectors, University Secretary, Deans and Deputy Deans at USU, and invited guests.

The Rector of USU appreciated PT Pegadaian's step in helping USU establish The Gade Creative Lounge. According to him, this is a place for students to be active and develop themselves.

“We are very grateful to PT Pegadaian for encouraging student self-development through The Gade Creative Lounge. I consider The Gade Creative Lounge a visualization gateway to enter the creative lounge. So it gives meaning if anyone who enters this lounge will open up innovation and creativity," he said.

In addition, Muryanto Amin said that USU should be grateful for being the first university outside Java to host The Gade Creative Lounge. It should be used as much as possible for student self-development.

“USU is the first PTN outside Java to host The Gade Creative Lounge. We should be proud and grateful for this. We want to encourage students to develop themselves so that after graduation, they can support themselves and those around them through innovation and creativity," said Muryanto.

On the same occasion, the Mayor of Medan said that the Medan City Government had communicated with pawnshops several times to help UMKM in Medan. With the PT Gade Creative Lounge, Bobby hopes students can use it. According to him, this program provides facilities for students to be more creative and develop.

"Students are expected to be able to shift their interests towards entrepreneurs. I hope this becomes a facility that can support the student's self-development", he said.

In addition, Bobby hopes that The Gade Creative Lounge can also be used by students outside USU and the wider community. The existence of The Gade Creative Lounge is expected to be a meeting point for UMKM in the city of Medan.

President Director of PT Pegadaian Kuswiyoto said that his party is committed to encouraging the world of higher education in Indonesia. According to him, The Gade Creative Lounge is a momentum for students to spawn their creativity.

“The Gade Creative Lounge, University of North Sumatra. As this program is a public space intended for students and the academic community as a supporting facility for academic, curricular, and extra-curricular activities," said Kuswiyoto.
