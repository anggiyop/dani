"Army officers who wish to continue their studies at master and doctoral degrees are welcome and we can even make a curriculum that can be adjusted. More importantly, we can train our students to defend their country so that the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia is strong. Then the third is to combine TMMD with Thematic KKN, if this collaboration runs well the results will be so great," the Rector of USU said.

USU-Kodam Collaborate on Education and State Defense Programs

USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) officially cooperates with the Regional Military Command (Kodam). This was stated in the signing in the Rector's Audience Room on Friday, (11/04/2022).

This five-year collaboration aims to provide mutual support between the University and the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI). The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) will accept TNI personnel who wish to take or continue their master's or doctoral education with standards set by the university and in accordance with their field of work in the TNI.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S. Sos., M.Si hopes that by establishing this collaboration students can be trained to have strong national defense. He also added that combining TNI Manunggal Developing Villages (TMMD) with Thematic KKN was collaboration with very great results.

"Army officers who wish to continue their studies at master's and doctoral degrees are welcome and we can even make a curriculum that can be adjusted. More importantly, we can train our students to defend their country so that the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia is strong. Then the third is to combine TMMD with Thematic KKN, if this collaboration runs well the results will be so great," the Rector of USU said.

Pangdam I/Bukit Barisan Major General TNI Achmad Daniel Chardin said, in this collaboration, HR in the TNI who wish to increase their knowledge will be given the opportunity to study at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU).

TNI personnel are willing to support various student development activities at USU such as new student activities namely counseling, debriefing, national insight, and others.

"So our first goal is that this collaboration can support each other, maybe the human resources in the TNI who wish to add insight and knowledge according to their field of work can be given the opportunity to study, of course, with the standards set by the university," he explained.

Secondly, he added, with this collaboration we also offer parts of our duties and functions that USU can actually use for student development activities, for example with menwa training, such as counseling, debriefing, national insight, health, said Major General TNI Achmad Daniel Chardin. (©ULC)
