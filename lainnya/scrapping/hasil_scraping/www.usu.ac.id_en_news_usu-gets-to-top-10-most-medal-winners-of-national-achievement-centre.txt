Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is in the top 10 universities with the most medals in the National Mathematics and Natural Science Competition (KNMIPA) held by the National Achievement Center, the Ministry of Education and Cultural, Research, and Technology.

For those achievements, the Rector of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., on Monday (8/2/2021) congratulated USU students who have succeed in making USU proud in the national competition.

"Such achievement shows that our students are no less competitive. They must be encouraged to continue to excel in the national level and even in international level,” he said.
