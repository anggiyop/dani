This study reveals the crucial role of Early Initiation of Breastfeeding (EIBF) in enhancing the success of Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF) among working mothers in Indonesia. Using data from the 2021 National Nutrition Survey, the research highlights challenges and necessary policies to support working mothers in providing exclusive breastfeeding.

Amidst the growing health campaigns and the promotion of optimal nutrition for infants, breastfeeding remains an irreplaceable aspect of a mother's life. From the moment a baby is born, Early Initiation of Breastfeeding (EIBF) is often considered the foundation for the success of Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF). It not only provides long-term health benefits for the baby but also for the mother. However, in Indonesia, working mothers face greater challenges in practicing EBF compared to non-working mothers, as they must juggle their professional responsibilities, household duties, and maternal roles.

 

This issue serves as the background for the research conducted by Isyatun Mardhiyah Syahri and Maya Fitria from Universitas Sumatera Utara, Agung Dwi Laksono and Mara Ipa from the National Research and Innovation Agency of the Republic of Indonesia, as well as Nikmatur Rohmah from Universitas Muhammadiyah Jember, and Masruroh Masruroh from Universitas Pesantren Tinggi Darul Ulum, Jombang. Their study, titled "Exclusive Breastfeeding among Indonesian Working Mothers: Does Early Initiation of Breastfeeding Matter?", employs a cross-sectional research method by analyzing secondary data from the 2021 Indonesia National Nutrition Survey. The study reveals that the success of EBF among working mothers in Indonesia is significantly influenced by EIBF. This research not only provides insights into the extent of EIBF's impact on EBF but also highlights various challenges faced by working mothers.

 

Through a study involving 4,003 working mothers with infants under six months old, the research delves deeper into the relationship between EIBF and EBF success. Although previous studies have discussed the importance of EBF, this study focuses on working mothers who encounter unique challenges, both in their professional and domestic roles. The findings reveal a striking fact: the proportion of mothers practicing EBF in Indonesia in 2021 was 51.9%, a figure lower than expected compared to global standards.

 

"However, this number does not fully capture the challenges faced by working mothers. The study found that working mothers who practiced EIBF were 2.053 times more likely to continue EBF compared to those who did not practice EIBF," stated Isyatun. Early breastfeeding initiation, conducted within the first hour after birth, has proven to have a significant impact on ensuring the continuation of exclusive breastfeeding. This evidence demonstrates that the initial steps taken immediately after birth can have long-term effects on breastfeeding success.

 

Beyond EIBF, several other factors influence the success of EBF among working mothers. The study identifies that residential location, maternal age, marital status, education level, prenatal class attendance, wealth status, infant age, infant gender, and birth weight all contribute to EBF success. It is undeniable that socioeconomic factors significantly impact access to necessary facilities and support for sustaining EBF. For instance, mothers in urban areas may have easier access to healthcare facilities and workplaces that support breastfeeding, while those in remote areas may encounter more obstacles.

 

"In a more in-depth discussion, we examined the various challenges working mothers face in practicing EBF. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of workplace support," Isyatun explained. Many workplaces do not provide breastfeeding-friendly facilities, such as lactation rooms or adequate break times for mothers to express milk. Additionally, societal norms often perceive working mothers as less attentive to their children, creating a heavy psychological burden. The high demands of work, coupled with the need to maintain family relationships, add to the challenges faced by mothers who wish to continue exclusive breastfeeding. This underscores the importance of supportive policies for working mothers to ensure EBF success.

 

Furthermore, family support plays a crucial role in determining EBF success. In many cases, the involvement of husbands and other family members significantly influences whether a mother can continue exclusive breastfeeding. When families, especially husbands, fully support a mother’s decision to breastfeed and provide assistance, such as helping care for the baby while the mother works, the likelihood of continuing EBF increases significantly.

 

Considering these realities, it is clear that EBF success does not solely depend on a mother's intention and capability but also on the social support surrounding her. Therefore, the conclusions of this study are particularly important for policymakers. The Indonesian government needs to design policies that better support EIBF and EBF for working mothers. One essential step is extending maternity leave for working mothers. By providing sufficient recovery time after childbirth, mothers can focus more on exclusively breastfeeding their infants. Additionally, policies requiring companies to provide adequate lactation facilities in workplaces should be considered. Breastfeeding-friendly facilities, such as designated rooms for expressing milk, can help mothers continue breastfeeding even while working.

 

Further research is necessary to explore in greater depth the qualitative barriers preventing working mothers from practicing EBF. Factors such as societal norms, stigma, and psychological pressures faced by working mothers need to be examined further to develop more comprehensive solutions. Through more supportive policies and cultural shifts that encourage mothers’ roles within families and society, the success rate of EBF in Indonesia can hopefully increase.

 

EBF success is not merely an individual achievement but a collective effort involving families, communities, and the government. Early Initiation of Breastfeeding, as a crucial first step, plays a vital role in ensuring EBF continuity, especially for working mothers. Therefore, greater attention to the conditions faced by working mothers, along with strengthened policies and social support, is essential to ensure that every infant receives the best nutrition through exclusive breastfeeding. "We all have a role to play in creating a healthier society by supporting mothers who strive to provide the best for their children," concluded Isyatun.
