This study highlights the importance of product diversification and organic certification to increase the added value of persimmons in East Java. These strategies are expected to increase farmers' income and create new market opportunities.

In the highlands of East Java, there is a small, golden-orange fruit full of great potential. Yes, the persimmon. While persimmons may not be the first fruit that comes to mind when visiting a fruit store, this fruit holds a big secret that could transform the lives of farmers in this region. The demand for persimmons has been increasing, especially after researchers discovered that the fruit contains compounds with the potential to help combat COVID-19, which was a major public concern at the time. In fact, this fruit is not only delicious but also has extraordinary health benefits, making it a valuable asset that needs to be better utilized.

Persimmons are rich in nutrients: water, protein, fat, carbohydrates, as well as various vitamins such as A and C. Not only that, but the potassium, phenol, and tannin content in them gives persimmons strong antioxidant properties. In many previous studies, persimmons have been cited as potentially useful in preventing diseases such as cancer and heart disease. With all these health benefits, persimmons should have high market value.

However, contrary to expectations, many farmers in this region are still grappling with low income due to the underutilization of persimmons. For example, in the regions of Bumiaji, Ampelgading, and Tirtoyudo, East Java, farmers have been growing persimmons for years. However, the quality and quantity of persimmons produced have not been consistent. One of the main problems faced by farmers is how to increase the added value of this fruit so that their income can increase significantly.

Addressing this issue, a research team consisting of Ayu Erfiana Asmy, Abdul Rauf, Rahmawaty, Badaruddin from Universitas Sumatera Utara, Indonesia, and Umrotul Khasanah from Universitas Islam Negeri Malang, Indonesia, examined the importance of reformulating the persimmon value-added model as a strategy to increase farmers' incomes in East Java. This study primarily used a product diversification approach, as most farmers only sell persimmons in fresh fruit form. “Through product diversification, persimmons can be processed into various derivative products, such as processed foods and beverages, which have higher selling value,” said Ayu Erfiana.

One solution is processing persimmons into jam, juice, candied fruit, or even as a base ingredient for natural cosmetics. In other countries, processed persimmon products have become popular commodities with a higher selling price compared to the fresh fruit. By applying this concept, farmers in East Java could open new markets and significantly increase their income.

“Not only product diversification, but improving quality and packaging is also key. Many consumers today are not only looking for delicious products, but also for those that are well-packaged and attractive. Smart packaging can increase the appeal of the product in consumers' eyes and simultaneously raise its value in the market,” explained Prof. Abdul Rauf, who was also involved in this research.

In addition to product diversification, product certification and labeling also play an important role in increasing the market value of persimmons. Certification will foster consumer trust in the quality of the products they purchase. Organic certification, for example, is expected to attract a broader market segment, especially among consumers concerned with health and the environment. Prof. Abdul Rauf added that increasing the nutritional value of processed persimmon products could also be a unique selling point, as today’s consumers are increasingly aware of the importance of nutrition in the food they consume. Therefore, enhancing the nutritional value through careful processing could make persimmon products more desirable in the market.

To achieve all the hopes and plans presented, training and capacity building for farmers are essential. This means that farmers need to be equipped with sufficient knowledge and skills to process persimmons into products with higher added value. Without this training, it will be difficult for them to compete in an increasingly competitive market. “Developing networks and partnerships with private entities is also an important step that farmers need to take,” said Prof. Abdul Rauf.

In today's business world, having a wide network can open up many new opportunities, both in terms of marketing and product distribution. By forging partnerships with private companies, farmers can access broader markets and gain support in terms of distribution and marketing. Another issue that needs attention is access to capital and financing, which remains a major challenge faced by farmers. Without sufficient capital, it will be difficult for farmers to invest in the downstream processing of persimmon products. Therefore, the government and financial institutions need to provide accessible financing schemes for farmers so they can make the necessary investments to increase the value of their products.

The research also highlights the importance of innovation and continuous research in the development of persimmon products. Innovations in processing, packaging, and marketing can help farmers continuously improve the quality and variety of their products. In this way, persimmon products from East Java can compete in both national and international markets.

“Behind all these strategies, there is one thing that must not be overlooked: sustainability. The development of persimmon product downstreaming must be carried out while still adhering to the principles of sustainable agriculture. This means that the processing and production process must be carried out in an environmentally friendly manner and not harm the local ecosystem,” explained Prof. Abdul Rauf.

Organic and sustainable certification can be an effective tool to ensure that the agricultural practices carried out by farmers comply with good environmental standards. On the other hand, farmers must also be encouraged to adopt more efficient and environmentally friendly farming practices, such as using organic fertilizers and water-efficient irrigation techniques. Through sustainable agriculture promotion programs, not only will farmers benefit, but so will the wider community. Sustainable agriculture can create jobs, reduce unemployment, and ultimately improve the rural economy. This step is of utmost importance in building a better future for farmers and communities in East Java.

In conclusion, reformulating the value-added model of persimmons is a golden opportunity for farmers in East Java. With the right strategy, this small fruit can become a significant source of income for them. From product diversification to organic certification, every step taken to increase the value-added of persimmon products can have a major impact on the lives of farmers.
