<description>The public lecture discuss the topic of agricultural downstreaming with the theme “Agribusiness as the Basis for the Reindustrialization of the Indonesian Economy.”</description>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>MEDAN-Public Relations USU</strong>: The Faculty of Agriculture at Universitas Sumatera Utara, together with the Agribusiness Undergraduate Program and PT. Agrari, held a public lecture featuring Prof. Bungaran Saragih, Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia from 2000 to 2004, on Wednesday, February 2, 2025, at the Suratman Hall. Prof. Bungaran is a prominent figure and one of the distinguished professors at Bogor Agricultural University.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">The public lecture focused on agricultural downstreaming with the theme “Agribusiness as the Foundation for the Re-Industrialization of Indonesia's Economy.” Also in attendance were Prof. Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana, MS, Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture at USU, deputy deans, program heads, and program secretaries, Head of Agronomy at PT Agrari Agus Hatimbulan, SP, and students.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">In his opening remarks, Prof. Tavi stated that it was an honor for the Faculty of Agriculture to have Prof. Bungaran Saragih as a speaker. “I have personally witnessed through my own experience that Prof. Bungaran Saragih is an extremely intelligent individual, particularly in the field of macroeconomics, during my time as his student in the master’s program at IPB.”</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">The public lecture was moderated by Vista Uli Sihombing, M.Si. In her opening remarks, she explained that the theme presented was an effort to reflect on and prospectively examine how the agricultural sector should not be viewed solely from a production perspective. Agriculture must be positioned as the driving force for national economic transformation, particularly through downstreaming approaches and the comprehensive development of agribusiness systems.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">Prof. Bungaran Saragih explained in his presentation, “Currently, Indonesia is targeted to achieve an 8% annual economic growth rate, as well as food security and energy security. To build the foundation for 8% economic growth, the government is promoting industrialization, now more commonly called downstreaming. Although Indonesia’s downstreaming efforts have been ongoing for some time, they remain relatively superficial on an aggregate level. This is reflected in the ratio of the value added by the agro-industrial sector to the agricultural sector in 2023, which remains around one."</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">The participants were highly enthusiastic about the lecture, as evidenced by the numerous questions posed during the question-and-answer session.</p> ]]>

The latest ranking of QS World University Rankings (QS-WUR) 2026 shows that USU managed to move up 200 ranks, from the 1201+ group to 1001-1200 in the world. This leap is evidence of the strengthening of academic quality and global competitiveness that USU strives for.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The achievement was announced through an official press release delivered by USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., on Sunday (22/6/2025). The Rector said that this increase was the result of hard work and collaboration across the entire academic community. "This improvement is the result of extraordinary collective hard work. However, our journey is not over yet. USU will continue to improve and progress towards a world-class university," said Prof. Muryanto. Based on the QS-WUR 2026 results, USU's aggregate score jumped from 7.3 to 13.8, or an increase of 89% over the previous year. The score is calculated based on eight main indicators: academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty-student ratio, international research network, international faculty, international students, citations per faculty, and employment outcomes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">One of the indicators that showed the most significant spike was Sustainability, with an increase of more than 100%. In addition, Employer Reputation increased by 67%, and Academic Reputation increased by 63.6%. No less important, the Citations per Faculty indicator also increased by 38.5%, which has been known as one of the most challenging components to improve. "The increase in the citation indicator shows that USU's research results are increasingly recognized and have a real impact at the global level. This aligns with the spirit of ‘Campus Impact’ promoted by the Ministry of Education and Culture," added the Rector.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">QS World University Rankings is widely recognized as one of the most prestigious university ranking systems and is widely used as an international reference. In addition to rising global rankings, USU also recorded the 62nd position for the Southeast Asia Rank, and the 329th rank in the Asia Rank.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This achievement confirms USU's position as one of the leading public universities in Indonesia that consistently improves the quality of education, research productivity, and international collaboration capacity.</p> ]]>
