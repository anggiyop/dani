As a speaker, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., recommended restructuring the academic environment to accelerate internationalization.

USU PR — A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) between Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the State Islamic University of North Sumatra (UINSU) was held to discuss the topic of "Opportunities and Challenges in the Development of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) & the Strategic Role of Stakeholders." The discussion was led by the Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., and took place at the Royal Suite Condotel in Medan on Thursday (Apr. 4, 2024).

 

The backdrop of uncontrollable changes served as the key context for this FGD. The USU Rector, in addressing this, emphasized that the Tri Dharma (three main functions of higher education institutions: education and teaching, research, and community service) must be adaptive and integrative in reviewing the curriculum, learning processes, and industry matching.

 

As a speaker, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., recommended restructuring the academic environment to accelerate internationalization. Grant programs for national and international competitions were suggested as steps to accelerate the improvement of faculty and student capabilities. Developing well-thought-out planning strategies was deemed essential for achieving the annual priority targets of university programs.

 

Intentionally inviting the USU Rector and stakeholders, the UINSU Rector, Prof. Dr. Nurhayati, M.Ag., sought to hear the USU Rector's perspective on UINSU and what recommendations could be made for its future development. Likewise, stakeholders utilized this FGD as a platform for sharing developments and opinions.

 

According to the UINSU Rector, USU was perceived to have made significant progress, thus hoping for meaningful support and input to help UINSU improve its achievements and accreditation. This FGD activity was also described as implementing the collaboration between USU and UINSU.

 

"This FGD is very beneficial for the development of UINSU. We intentionally invited the USU Rector to obtain good information and input considering USU's remarkable progress, " the UINSU Rector added in his interview.

 

The Chairperson of the Quality Assurance Agency of UINSU, Dr. Muhammad Yafz, M.Ag., felt honored to gain new insights and information from the USU Rector regarding the importance of the university's role in managing institutions to become more independent, which served as input for UINSU. He hoped stakeholders would also partner with UINSU to support its development jointly.

 

"We are very grateful because, with the material provided by the Rector of USU, we have received valuable inputs," he added.
