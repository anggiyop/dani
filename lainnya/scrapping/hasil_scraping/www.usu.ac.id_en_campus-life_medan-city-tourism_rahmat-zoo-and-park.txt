Rahmat Zoo and Park

Rahmat Zoo and Park, located at Perbaungan, Serdang Bedagai, is a zoo built by Dr. H. Rahmat Shah, a tourism entrepreneur and environmental activist. The zoo results from Dr. H. Rahmat Shah's initiative to create a place to preserve rare animals endemic to Indonesia. The zoo is divided into several zones: the Animal Zone, which houses almost 100 species of endemic Indonesian animals; the Child Zoo, with special games for children and cute animals; and the Photo Zone, which provides Instagramable photo spots for visitors who want to relax. Although the location is a bit far from Medan city, requiring about 1.5 hours by car, Rahmat Zoo and Park remains a popular destination for both locals and tourists. The uniqueness of this place lies in its beautiful design and lush natural atmosphere. With a land area of 20 hectares, this place is a tourist destination, an educational facility about endemic flora and fauna, and a conservation area. For visitors, especially USU students who have been on the move for an entire week due to class schedules, Rahmat Zoo and Park can be a place to refresh with campus friends.
