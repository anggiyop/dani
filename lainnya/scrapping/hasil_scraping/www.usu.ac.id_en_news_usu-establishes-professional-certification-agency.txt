With the LSP Competence, USU graduates are swiftly accepted for employment, and if they don't find employment, they can start their own business," according to Dr. Tetty.

USU PR-Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Workshop on Making Assessment Tools Validation & Trial of Assessment Tools as a requirement for the establishment of the USU Professional Certification Institute (LSP) from Monday to Saturday (24-29/07/2023) in the Lecturer Meeting Room of the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) USU.

Dr. Tetty Yuliaty SE, M.Si, chair of the Working Committee for the Establishment of LSP USU, explained that this activity is a training for prospective LSP USU Assessors who will later design the Certification Competency Test instrument at LSP USU.

The training this week focuses on developing "what kind of device," "what kind of question form," and "what kind of method," she said.

Dr. Tetty Yuliaty hopes that the establishment of LSP USU will make it simpler for USU students to find employment, allowing them to enhance the quality of USU. This activity comprises seven initiatives: Customer Service, Digital Marketing, and Laboratory Technician.

"With the LSP Competence, USU graduates are swiftly accepted for employment, and if they don't find employment, they can start their own business," according to Dr. Tetty.

As Director of LSP Profesional Migas Indonesia, Ir. H. Wahyu Adiartono, MBA, Ph.D., stated that this activity is necessary so that each field can discuss and follow the existing norms.

"Because there are rules that must be followed when compiling this document," he explained.

Additionally, he stated that the activity, which consists of compiling, validating, and testing, is intended to produce prospective USU LSP examiners who are qualified and capable of developing competency test materials.

"For the USU professional certification body to have enough qualified examiners in the future," he said.
