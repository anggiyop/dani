Today is a continuation of the series of events to commemorate the anniversary of FMIPA, and today we have a fun walk, followed by a ceremonial event and the distribution of prizes," explained Dr. Nursahara

USU PR- A Fun Walk was organized to continue the events to celebrate the 58th Anniversary of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) with the theme "Collaboration and Innovation of MIPA Supports World-Class University" occurred in the FMIPA USU Courtyard on Saturday (11/11/2023).

Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, M.Sc., the Dean of FMIPA USU, explained that during the fun walk and ceremonial event, various parties, including university leaders, alums, and study programs, provided prizes. The total number of prizes prepared reached around 150, including those budgeted by the faculty. There was also support from sponsors such as Bank Sumut, Bank Mandiri, and others.

"Today is a continuation of the series of events to commemorate the anniversary of FMIPA, and today we have a fun walk, followed by a ceremonial event and the distribution of prizes," explained Dr. Nursahara.

The theme of this celebration represents the determination and efforts of FMIPA to achieve global excellence standards in the field of education. Therefore, Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, M.Sc., attempted to conceptualize that FMIPA can embrace and understand the essence of the World Class University proclaimed to be achieved in 2025.

"The meaning we take from the theme of collaboration and innovation in the celebration of FMIPA's anniversary is a step towards achieving World-Class University status," said Dr. Nursahara.

In an effort to achieve its World Class University ambition, Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, M.Sc., emphasized that the main purpose of the Dies Natalis celebration is to achieve the vision in line with the theme, which is to collaborate and innovate sustainably. This involves synergistic cooperation between lecturers, students, alums, and other related parties.

"We focus our efforts on collaboration among stakeholders and continuously innovate in educational approaches to achieve a World-Class University," emphasized Dr. Nursahara.

Ir. Heri Batanghari, M.Psi., as the Chair of the FMIPA Alumns Association (IKA), expressed pride in the alums's long journey in making positive contributions to the world of education.

With an age now considered mature enough, FMIPA USU has produced many alums scattered abroad and present throughout the archipelago.

"As the Chair of IKA FMIPA, I congratulate the 58th Anniversary. An age that we consider mature enough to be present amid the world of education," said Ir. Heri.

Ir. Heri Batanghari, M.Psi., hopes this activity can continue, providing joint motivation to all FMIPA USU alums and students. Thus, the anniversary commemoration moment can strengthen the alums's bond in providing positive contributions and a positive spirit among all stakeholders of FMIPA USU.

"We, from IKA FMIPA, hope that this activity continues to motivate us, friends who are part of the FMIPA USU family, to make positive contributions," hoped Ir. Heri."
