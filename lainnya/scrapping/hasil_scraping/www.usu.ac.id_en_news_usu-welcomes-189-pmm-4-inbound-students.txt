"PMM is not only about learning; there is also an opportunity to get to know the culture, community, tribe, and nature of North Sumatra Province," explained Dr. Edy.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) welcomed the Batch 4 Inbound Students of the Merdeka Student Exchange (PMM) at the Auditorium on Tuesday (02/20/2024).

Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., said this is the first time PMM has been held twice a year. Inbound PMM 4 students will study at USU during the even semester period of T.A. 2023/2024.

"This is the initial implementation of the PMM program, and since it runs for a full year, there will be two PMM cycles completed within a year," said Dr. Edy.

As in the previous batch of the PMM program, Vice Rector I said that this Student Exchange program is not limited to classroom learning. Later, students participating in PMM 4 will have the opportunity to explore and learn more about the culture, tribes, people, and natural environment found in North Sumatra through the archipelago module program.

"PMM is not only about learning; there is also an opportunity to get to know the culture, community, tribe, and nature of North Sumatra Province," explained Dr. Edy.

In line with that, Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, S.T., MM.I.T., as Director of the Directorate of Development and Education, said that the archipelago module program is one of 20 credits for this PMM program and must be followed by all PMM 4 students.

"There will also be an archipelago module program now, which must be followed as one of a series of 20 credits for student exchange activities," said Dr. Anggia.

For information, Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, S.T., MM.I.T., said the total number of Inbound student exchanges at USU was 189 from 82 universities throughout Indonesia, an increase from the previous batch.
