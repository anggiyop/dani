“The main message of Christmas is love. The academic community is expected to continue to build togetherness and share love with everyone, regardless of differences,” said Prof. Himsar.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the 2024 Oikumene Christmas Celebration, with the theme “Living Offerings to God” taken from Romans 12: 1, with the subtheme “Through this Christmas celebration, the USU Christian family presents themselves to God as a living sacrifice, holy, and pleasing to God.” It took place at the USU Auditorium, on Saturday (07/12/2024).

This activity was organized by the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) USU as the organizing committee and was filled with various series of events. In addition to joint worship, this event also involved social action in the form of visits and providing assistance to a number of orphanages around Medan as a form of love for others.

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., expressed his appreciation for the spirit of togetherness and collaboration manifested in this celebration. He also emphasized the importance of the Christmas theme as a moral message to benefit others. The Rector also reminded that the values of love, tolerance, and collaboration voiced through Christmas must continue to be applied in everyday life.

“This theme teaches us to continue to benefit society, regardless of religion, and make our lives an offering that is pleasing to God,” said Prof. Muryanto.

In line with that, Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, ST., MT., Chairperson of the USU Christian Holiday Committee (PHBK), emphasized the importance of this event being a momentum that inspires the entire USU family to continue to offer a meaningful life for God and have a positive impact on the wider community.

“The main message of Christmas is love. The academic community is expected to continue to build togetherness and share love with everyone, regardless of differences,” he said.

The Chairperson of the Christmas Committee, Prof. Dr. Elisabet Siahaan, SE, M.Ec., expressed her gratitude for the support from various parties that made this celebration run smoothly. She also highlighted the social action as a tangible form of the celebration theme.

“Through social actions to orphanages, we hope that the spirit of love and care can be felt by those in need,” said Prof. Elisabet.

Kombes Pol Bambang Kusnarianto, Head of Finance (Kabid Keu) of the North Sumatra Police, was also present to give a speech. He appreciated the spirit of togetherness in this celebration and hoped that Christmas values could continue to be lived by the entire academic community.

The USU 2024 Oikumene Christmas celebration took place joyfully and brought inspiration to all participants. Not only a moment of spiritual reflection, this event is also a tangible proof of how love and care can be realized through social action.
