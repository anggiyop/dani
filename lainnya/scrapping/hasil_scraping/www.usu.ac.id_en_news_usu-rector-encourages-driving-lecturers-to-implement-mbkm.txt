USU PUBLIC RELATION: Driving Lecturers, becomes USU’s strategy to improve the success of MBKM implementation. USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., mandated so that driving lecturers are able to encourage program implementation as the realization of Transformation towards the Ultimate, on his opening remarks at the Socialization of USU Driving Lecturers event, on Monday (7/26/2021), virtually.

 

“As driving lecturer, I expect we are able to accelerate the implementation of MBKM within USU. We have to capture the potential, passion of our students to be developed. This is what I came up with in the tagline Transformation Towards the Ultimate as a form of transformation of educational world,” USU Rector said.

USU Rector said that as a lecturer, he should be able to improve students’ ability based on their potential. The campus must provide a forum for that potential to be developed.

“The campus provides a place for students to develop their own potential. As lecturers, we can’t just force our desires, but it is about how the students are able to develop in accordance to their passion,” Muryanto Amin mentioned.

According to him, the role of campus through lecturers would provide rails for students so they don’t get off-track. Although it gives opportunities for students to self-develop, these students are still in the corridor desired by the university

“Our job is to keep the students on-track and no one gets off-track. We provide forum for them to develop, however they need to keep on following the academic and university rules,” he added. 

 

According to the Rector of USU, the Covid-19 pandemic also gives wisdom to the world of education. This encourages the world of education to utilize technological advances. No more obstacles for the academics community to communicate.

“As we know, right now we are still struggling in the midst of the Covid-19 Pandemic to carry out our duties under the umbrella of Tri Dharma of the University. However, on the other hand, we are unable to deny that this pandemic has also given wisdom for all of us. One of them is the acceleration in hybrid learning in the implementation of MBKM program which we have to be involved in it,” he said.

Present at the meeting were the Vice Rectors of USU, Expert Staff, Head and Secretary of UPP, and lecturers at USU. (RR/©ULC)
