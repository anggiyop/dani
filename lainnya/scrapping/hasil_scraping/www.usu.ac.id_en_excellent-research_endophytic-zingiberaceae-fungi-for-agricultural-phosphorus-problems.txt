Using natural phosphate solubilizing agents can reduce dependence on chemical fertilizers that can potentially harm the environment. The results of this study provide a solid foundation for further research and practical application on a wider scale, bringing us one step closer to more sustainable and efficient agriculture,” Dr. Erman Munir concluded.

How can plants like trees grow so big and lush? Phosphorus is an essential nutrient that plants need for growth and development. However, its availability in soil is often limited, as phosphorus tends to be bound in an insoluble form. Plants’ inability to absorb phosphorus from the soil can hinder agricultural productivity. This concern is the background of the research conducted by Erman Munir and his team from the Universitas Sumatera Utara. They offered an innovative solution using endophytic fungi from the Zingiberaceae family.

This research focuses on isolating and characterizing the phosphate solubilizing activity of endophytic fungi found in Zingiberaceae species. This type of research is very important because endophytic fungi can potentially increase phosphorus availability for plants, thereby increasing overall agricultural productivity. In this study, 35 endophytic fungal isolates from the rhizomes of five genera of Zingiberaceae, namely Alpinia, Amomum, Elettaria, Etlingera, and Hedychium, were tested for phosphate solubilizing activity. More than 95% of phosphorus in soil is bound in a form that plants cannot take up. Phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs) can convert phosphorus into a soluble form through the secretion of organic acids. Using endophytic fungi as phosphate solubilizing agents can be a natural and efficient solution to increase phosphorus uptake by plants.

“The use of endophytic fungi as phosphate solubilizing agents can be a natural and efficient solution to increase phosphorus absorption by plants,” said Dr. Erman Munir, lead researcher, explaining the importance of this research.

The research method involved isolating and characterizing the phosphate-solubilizing activity of endophytic fungi found in Zingiberaceae species. Isolates with the highest solubilization index were then molecularly identified using PCR and phylogenetic analysis. This process allowed researchers to confirm that the isolated fungi were the desired species and had the potential as phosphate solubilizing agents.

The results showed that P. thailandica had the highest phosphate solubilizing capacity with a solubilization index of 1.5 and could solubilize phosphorus at 4.61 mg/L. “This shows that P. thailandica has great potential as a natural phosphate solubilizing agent,” said Anisa Lutfia, a research team member. Besides P. thailandica, other isolates such as Trichoderma atroviride El01, Trichoderma brevicrassum Am08, and Trichoderma scalesiae Al01 also showed significant potential as phosphate solubilizing agents.

This study’s uniqueness is its focus on endophytic fungi from Zingiberaceae that have not been widely explored before. This research also paves the way for using biological agents in more sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture. By exploring the potential of endophytic fungi from unusual plants, this research adds a new dimension to efforts to improve agricultural productivity through natural solutions.

“These endophytic fungi not only enhance phosphorus uptake but can also improve overall plant health through a mutually beneficial symbiosis,” said Adrian Hartanto, a research team member.

This research has important implications not only for agriculture but also for environmental conservation. Using natural phosphate solubilizing agents, we can reduce dependence on chemical fertilizers, potentially damaging the environment. The results of this study also provide a basis for further research to test the effectiveness of P. thailandica under field conditions. This research shows that natural solutions can be applied on a large scale to address problems faced by farmers worldwide.

In general, using endophytic fungi as phosphate solubilizing agents is part of a broader approach to using microorganisms to improve agricultural productivity. Soil microorganisms have long been recognized for their role in nutrient cycling and soil health. Farmers can improve nutrient use efficiency and reduce the negative impacts of chemical fertilizers by identifying and using microorganisms with specific capabilities, such as phosphate solubilization. Endophytic fungi, in particular, offer the added advantage of living within plant tissues without causing harm. These endophytic fungi enhance phosphorus uptake and can improve overall plant health through a mutually beneficial symbiosis. This proves that endophytic fungi can help plants survive environmental stress and pathogens and to improve nutrient uptake.

This study successfully demonstrated the great potential of endophytic fungi from Zingiberaceae as natural phosphate solubilizing agents. This research is an essential first step in finding a natural solution to soil’s phosphorus deficiency problem. It is hoped that further research and practical applications can see endophytic fungi as an innovative solution for more sustainable and productive agriculture. Farmers can reduce dependence on chemical fertilizers by using endophytic fungi, increase crop productivity, and maintain soil health in the long run.

The research also emphasizes the importance of collaboration between scientists, farmers, and policymakers to adopt environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural technologies.

“Using natural phosphate solubilizing agents can reduce dependence on chemical fertilizers that can potentially harm the environment. The results of this study provide a solid foundation for further research and practical application on a wider scale, bringing us one step closer to more sustainable and efficient agriculture,” Dr. Erman Munir concluded.
