"Easter is not just a celebration, but a commemoration of Christ's love, victory, and the gift of new hope. Peace built in the family becomes the foundation of a strong, resilient, and caring person for others," said Prof. Dr. Elisabet.

 

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the 2025 Oikumene Easter Celebration with the theme “The Peace of Christ in the Midst of the Family”, which took place at the USU Auditorium on Saturday (25/04/2025). The event was organized by the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) USU as the organizing committee, with a series of activities including social services to eight orphanages in Medan City as a tangible manifestation of love for others.

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., represented by Vice Rector V, Dr. Ir. Luhut Sihombing, M.P., expressed his appreciation for the spirit of love, tolerance, and togetherness shown in this celebration. He hoped that these values could continue to be instilled and lived by all USU academicians daily.

 

In line with that, the Chairperson of the USU Christian Holidays Committee (PHBK), Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, ST, MT, emphasized that this celebration is a vital momentum for offering life to God and spreading love in everyday life.

 

The Chairperson of the Easter Committee, Prof. Dr. Elisabet Siahaan, SE, M.Ec., emphasized that Easter is not just a celebration, but a great reminder of Christ's love and victory, and the gift of new hope. She also underlined the importance of building the peace of Christ in the family, as the basis for forming a strong personality and caring for others.

 

"Easter is not just a celebration, but a commemoration of Christ's love, victory, and the gift of new hope. Peace built in the family becomes the foundation of a strong, resilient, and caring person for others," said Prof. Dr. Elisabet.

 

The entire series of activities was held thanks to the synergy and support of alumni, lecturers, and students, which reflects the spirit of togetherness in the USU family. It is hoped that similar religious activities will continue to receive full support from the university.

 

“Activities like this not only strengthen relationships between campus residents, but also strengthen the spiritual values that are the foundation of our lives,” he added.

 

The USU 2025 Oikumene Easter celebration took place joyfully, becoming a valuable moment to strengthen the entire USU family's faith, hope, and togetherness.
