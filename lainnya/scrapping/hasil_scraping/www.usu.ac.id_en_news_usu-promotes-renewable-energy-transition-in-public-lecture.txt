“Energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources is a complex and challenging journey, but essential for achieving environmental sustainability and reducing climate change impacts,” said Prof. Poppy.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted a public lecture titled “Transition from Fossil Fuels to Renewable Energy: Converting Fossil Fuel Engines to Electric Motors and Integrated Infrastructure for Natural Resource and Environmental Management” in the IMT-GT Room, 2nd Floor of the Rectorate Building on Wednesday, July 31, 2024.

 

The lecture featured two speakers who shared insights on energy transition: Prof. Yohannes Sardjono, a senior researcher at the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN); and Okto Larindo, CEO of PT Semesta Motor Indonesia (Motoriz).

 

USU Vice Rector III, Prof. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., highlighted the urgent need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy for the planet's sustainability. Fossil fuel use has significantly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions, leading to global climate change. Therefore, transitioning to renewable energy is an unavoidable step.

 

“Energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources is a complex and challenging journey, but essential for achieving environmental sustainability and reducing climate change impacts,” said Prof. Poppy.

 

The Vice Rector emphasized the crucial role of higher education institutions in this transition. Universities have a responsibility to educate and train the younger generation to become pioneers in the development and application of renewable energy technologies. Through research and innovation, universities contribute to discovering new, more efficient, and environmentally friendly solutions.

 

“I hope that through this public lecture, we can gain deeper knowledge and inspiration to contribute to the energy transition efforts,” concluded Prof. Poppy.

 

Prof. Yohannes Sardjono discussed Indonesia’s crucial role in the energy transition, emphasizing the conversion of gasoline engines to electric motors. He noted that USU, as the largest university in Sumatra, plays a significant role in supporting the government’s energy transition program through interdisciplinary collaboration.

 

“USU, with its various programs such as Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Information Technology, and the Faculty of Economics and Business, has the capacity to support the government’s target of converting 50,000 gasoline engines to electric motors this year,” he asserted.
