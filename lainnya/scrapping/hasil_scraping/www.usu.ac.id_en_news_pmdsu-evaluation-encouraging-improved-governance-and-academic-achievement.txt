“Well, the arrival of evaluators from the Ministry of Higher Education is a positive thing for us,” said Vice Rector I USU.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from the Directorate General of Higher Education, Research and Technology (Dikti) for the Monitoring and Evaluation of Masters to Doctoral Education for Excellent Undergraduates (PMDSU) on Thursday, (7/11/2024) in the Academic Senate Meeting Room of the USU Administrative Center Bureau.

 

USU Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH, MA said that this evaluation from a third party is a positive step that can help universities see weaknesses and potential improvements that may not be seen from an internal perspective.

 

“Well, the arrival of evaluators from the Ministry of Higher Education is a positive thing for us,” said Edy.

 

Furthermore, Vice Rector I explained that the results of this evaluation will be used to improve governance through the issuance of a rector's decree as a follow-up to the latest regulatory changes. This policy aims to strengthen the management of master's and doctoral programs comprehensively.

 

“So the rector's regulations, academic regulations related to PMDSU specifically must be derived in accordance with the mandate of the latest pertor changes,” explained Edy.

 

On the same occasion, the Director of the Graduate School, Prof. Ir. T. Sabrina M.Agr.Sc., Ph.D, proudly said that all PMDSU Batch 5 students graduated on time without any obstacles. This is an achievement that is an advantage for USU compared to several other universities in Indonesia.

 

“I also have goosebumps, yes. All PMDSU Batch 5 students have graduated. There are no more who did not graduate. It's amazing,” said Sabrina.

 

Not only that, PMDSU Batch 7 students also showed extraordinary achievements by publishing 11 scientific publications within one year.

 

“While we, as lecturers, can only publish one publication a year,” said Sabrina.

 

Even so, the limitation of highly qualified promoters is still a challenge, especially in ensuring that students graduate on time. USU will also adjust to various new developments in the PMDSU program, including plans for a joint degree-based PMDSU program next year, and encourage more lecturers to become PMDSU promoters to expand access for outstanding students.
