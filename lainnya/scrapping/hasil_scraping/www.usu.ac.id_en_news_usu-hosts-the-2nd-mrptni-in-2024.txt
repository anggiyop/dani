All issues should be promptly discussed, and solutions sought, with Rectors and academic communities working together to resolve all existing problems," the Director-General of Higher Education explained

USU PR — As many as 33 Rectors of State Universities (PTN) throughout Indonesia were invited to attend the Meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Indonesian State University Rectors Council (MRPTNI) in 2024 with the University of Sumatera Utara (USU) as the successful host on Friday (Jun. 21, 2024) at the Digital Learning Center Building, USU.

This meeting is not the first to be held; it was previously organized at the Universitas Negeri Padang (UNP), making this the 2nd Meeting of the MRPTNI Board of Trustees. As the host, the Rector of the University of Sumatera Utara, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., warmly welcomed the attending Rectors to this council meeting.

The Indonesian State University Rectors Council comprises 144 members, including 67 Academic Universities, 44 Vocational Universities, and 24 State Islamic Universities. The Director-General of Higher Education, Research, and Technology at the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia, Prof. Dr. Rer. Nat. Abdul Haris, M.Sc., also led the continuity of the meeting.

According to Prof. Dr. Rer. Nat. Abdul Haris, M.Sc., issues that often arise in the education sector, such as higher education budgets and the diversity of the learning process in each study program, should be discussed in forums like the MRPTNI by the Rectors. It's not only the role of the Rectors, but all academic communities should participate in helping to provide education or understanding to the broader society about educational guarantees.

"All issues should be promptly discussed, and solutions sought, with Rectors and academic communities working together to resolve all existing problems," the Director-General of Higher Education explained.
