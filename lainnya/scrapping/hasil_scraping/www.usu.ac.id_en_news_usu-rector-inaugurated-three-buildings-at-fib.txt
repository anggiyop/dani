"Hopefully, this building can spur increased performance, productivity, and achievement of study programs and faculties," he said

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si inaugurated three buildings of the Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) on Monday (30/05/2022). The inaugurated three buildings were the Performance Building, Multimedia Laboratory, and One-Roof Application Room (ASA).

With the inauguration of this building, the USU Rector hopes to complete the lecture facilities at USU's FIB and can encourage the spirit of work. It is also expected to increase student achievement and creativity within the scope of national cultural development and give birth to innovations in the arts and culture field.

The USU Rector also said that the presence of Ruang ASA at USU's FIB is also expected to provide excellent service that is faster, more precise, and accurate to service users, both internally and externally USU.

"Hopefully, this building can spur increased performance, productivity, and achievement of study programs and faculties," he said

On the same occasion, the Dean of FIB Dr. T. Thyrhaya Zein, M.A said that three new buildings could facilitate the learning process. Such as the Pagelaran building, which will later be used for drama, poetry, or dance performances so that they can be minor. And the Multimedia Laboratory building will later be used to carry out lectures that require multimedia devices.

"I hope this building can increase the enthusiasm of lecturers and students in studying," he said.

The Dean hopes that the completeness of adequate facilities will follow this building. These facilities will later be able to maximize the use of the building safely and comfortably. This building can be used for positive things and kept away from evil hands who want to damage the use of this building.

"Hopefully, no students will misuse this building like in the past," he said.
