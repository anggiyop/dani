"Previously, a webinar has been held on the Digital Business Directorate (DDB) program for MBKM discussed the results of the discussion on the success of the program at USU so that conclusions were then suggested to the executive to be able to advance MBKM at USU," said the Rector.

USU PR – Commission for Scientific Development, Quality of Education, and Ranking of the Board of Professors of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a webinar discussing the Strategy for Implementing Merdeka Belajar-Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) and Ranking at USU "Challenges and Opportunities". The activity was held online on Wednesday (20/04/2022).

In his remarks, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si explained that lecturers can be a source of information to develop the implementation of MBKM at USU so that students can develop their talents.

"Previously, a webinar has been held on the Digital Business Directorate (DDB) program for MBKM discussed the results of the discussion on the success of the program at USU so that conclusions were then suggested to the executive to be able to advance MBKM at USU," said the Rector.

The USU Rector also mentioned several important points discussed at the meeting. Namely, the challenges that must be faced in the MBKM program, such as requiring lecturers to change the way they teach in the classroom and how they work on updating all information related to scientific disciplines.

"I hope that lecturers do not only teach, but lecturers also have insight or understanding in the practical world to support students in developing their talents," he said.

In addition, it is also necessary to revitalize all existing tools or resources and the productivity of lecturers for research, publication, and innovation so that MBKM can raise its ranking in the national and international arena.

In line with this, the Secretary of the USU Board of Professors, Prof. Dr. Tamrin, M.Sc., also hopes that the commissions will hold a meeting to conclude the steps for advancing MBKM.

"I also hope that we can hold a workshop next month according to the expected MBKM program," he said.
