At the event, the Head of the USU Research and Innovation Development Agency (BPRI), Embun Suci Nasution S.Si. Apt., M.Farm.Klin, a lecturer at the Faculty of Pharmacy and a representative who received the NIB award. Embun Suci admitted that USU directly facilitated him and his team in terms of NIB certification.

PR USU - The Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) carried out the Granting of Business Identification Numbers (NIB) for Micro and Small Business Actors which took place at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Student Center on Thursday, (7/21/2022).

At the event, the Head of the USU Research and Innovation Development Agency (BPRI), Embun Suci Nasution S.Si. Apt., M.Farm.Klin, a lecturer at the Faculty of Pharmacy and a representative who received the NIB award. Embun Suci admitted that USU directly facilitated him and his team in terms of NIB certification.

"Alhamdulillah, USU itself has helped facilitate me and the team," said Embun Suci.

In addition to facilitating the issuance of NIB certification, USU will also facilitate the issuance of product publications and also MUI halal. The products produced by Embun Suci include yogurt, tofu, and anti-diabetes derived from sugar cane juice.

"God willing, in the future to facilitate product issuance permits and also MUI halal," he added.

At the same time, Buchari, S.t., M.Kes said that developing the business potential of students and lecturers is the task of the USU Innovation Research Development Agency. Such as facilitating business license certification.

"It's the same with students, we facilitate them to get a business license certification," said Buchari.

He explained that before the business of SMEs got into investment, initially there were stages in the form of an incubation process by BPRI with the condition that they first had an NIB. For students who do not have an NIB, they will be fostered by USU's BPRI.

"So before they enter our investment, the process phase is incubated by the innovation development agency," he explained.

At the end Buchari advised not to hesitate to try to start with creative ideas. Then run a business and get a business license which later USU's BPRI will facilitate USU's entrepreneurs to get certification.

"So my tips is don't hesitate to try to start with a creative idea then run it then get a business license," he said. (©ULC)
