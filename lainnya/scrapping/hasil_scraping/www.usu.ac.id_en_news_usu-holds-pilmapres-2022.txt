Vice-Rector (VR) I of USU Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA explained that this year, 20 students will compete to become champions at prestigious university level events. There are 12 students from Science and Technology (SainTek) and 8 students from the field of Social Humanities (SosHum).

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the agenda of Ministry of Education and Research and Technology's National for Achievement (PUSPRESNAS). Held at the Mieke Wijaya Hall, Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) on May 24-25, 2022, the activity discussed the Selection of Outstanding Students (PILMAPRES) USU in 2022.

In his remarks, Vice-Rector (VR) I of USU Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA explained that 20 students will compete to become champions at prestigious university-level events this year. There are 12 students from Science and Technology (SainTek) and 8 students from the field of Social Humanities (SosHum).

"I hope that in this selection round the participants are much more mature in preparing themselves," he said.

Edy Ikhsan added that, previously, briefing or mentoring activities had been carried out for participants to select outstanding students.

"This activity is one of the important stages that must be passed, to get a clear picture of the various materials that will be faced in the selection of USU's outstanding students at the university level," he said.

On the same occasion, the Chairperson of the PILMAPRES 2022 Assessor, Prof. Dr. Dwi Suryanto, M.Sc said that the judges were selected based on their expertise, so that the assessment was in accordance with their field.

Furthermore, if the participants graduate at the university level, the participants will represent USU at the regional level until entering the national level.

“This activity is one of the efforts so that USU can find outstanding students who will later be able to bring USU's name to the national level. I hope other students can also develop their talents and achievements,” he said.
