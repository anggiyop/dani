"We hope this achievement will motivate USU's Faculty of Law to continue to explore its best potential, contribute to increasing public trust in the implementation and regulation of law in Indonesia, and produce credible and competent alumni who will uphold the law and ensure justice for the Indonesian people. We also aim to strengthen collaboration and synergy with various parties to further enhance the quality of our law graduates," he said.

Meanwhile, the Dean of USU’s Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum., in his brief remarks while receiving the award, expressed his gratitude to Hukumonline for recognizing the efforts of Universitas Sumatera Utara’s Faculty of Law.
