The goal is to reach an understanding with the heads of study programmes on how to improve cooperation, then find the strategies that must be done in the future, said Prof Poppy.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and Yogyakarta State University (UNY) discussed strategies to increase cooperation in sharing information in the Academic Senate Meeting Room of the USU Building of the Bureau of Central Administration, Monday (27/02/2023).

This activity was attended by Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Partnership of USU Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si, M.Si., Apt and USU officials, while UNY was represented by Prof. Dr. Siswantoyo, S. Pd., M. Kes., AIFO as Vice Rector for Academic and Student Affairs of UNY.

The meeting started with a speech delivered by the Vice Rector III of USU Prof Dr Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si, M.Si, Apt. She hoped to get feedback from Prof Dr Siswantoyo, S.Pd, M.Kes, AIFO and discuss strategies to improve cooperation with USU.

“The goal is to reach an understanding with the heads of study programmes on how to improve cooperation, then find the strategies that must be done in the future”, said Prof Poppy.

On the same occasion, Prof. Dr. Siswantoyo, S. Pd., M. Kes., AIFO said that the most important thing now is to accelerate the optimisation and implementation of cooperation that can be proven through research results, innovations, and others so that industry, government, society, and the community will use the products from the universities.

"At the level of study programmes, we also have networks with industry, government, and other organisations so that the role of universities in the development of human resources in Indonesia will become even clearer to accelerate independence, as said by the President," he said.

In the end, the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs of UNY appreciated the progress of USU. He hopes that both USU and UNY can adopt the strengths and advantages of each other's campuses because it is in line with the tagline of the Faculty of Education UNY "Together We Go Forward, United We Can, Partnering We Win".
