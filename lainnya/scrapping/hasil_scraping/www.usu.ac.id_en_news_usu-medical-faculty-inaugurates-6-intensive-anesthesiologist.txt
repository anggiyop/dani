In his remarks, USU's Vice-Rector III, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, M.Sc., Apt. said that the inauguration of expertise to 6 anesthesiology intensive therapy doctors is good news. It has to deserve to be well appreciated. It is also an official acknowledgment of one's abilities as a specialist.

PR USU – The Faculty of Medicine (FK) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an event marking anesthesiology and intensive therapy at the USU FK and introducing new specialist doctor education program participants. The event took place at the Emerald Hotel Medan on Saturday (28/05/2022).

In his remarks, USU's Vice-Rector III, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, M.Sc., Apt. said that the inauguration of expertise to 6 anesthesiology intensive therapy doctors is good news. It has to deserve to be well appreciated. It is also an official acknowledgment of one's abilities as a specialist.

She also added that the anesthesiology doctors who have been inaugurated have incentives not to misuse their knowledge because there is a commitment and consistency of trust that doctors must carry out.

"Giving a mark of expertise also demands full commitment and consistency to the mandate given, and not to misuse it for purposes that are not beneficial to humanity," said Prof. Poppy.

Prof. Poppy hopes that in the future, more specialist doctors will graduate. However, specialist doctors who have been inaugurated can actively participate in the community. They also suggested to constantly updating their knowledge, expertise, and abilities to an international level to support the campus internationalization process.

"I hope for new specialist doctors to continue to update their knowledge, expertise, skills, and if possible, it must be at the international level," said Prof. Poppy.

In line with this, Deputy Dean 1 of USU FK DR. dr Deliyuzar M. Ked(PA) SpPA(K) said that commitment is one thing that an anesthesiologist must do. The anesthesiologist is highly expected, especially concerning intensive and emergency treatment.

"Hopefully, in addition to competence, commitment must also go hand in hand with the graduation of a new intensive anesthesiologist," said dr. Deliyuzar.

For information, the inauguration participants consisted of 6 intensive anesthesiologists and 9 participants from the USU Medical Specialist Education Program.
