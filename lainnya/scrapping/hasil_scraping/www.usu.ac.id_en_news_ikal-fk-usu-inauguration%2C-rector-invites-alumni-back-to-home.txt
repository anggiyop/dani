“The role of alumni today is very important in the development of universities and faculties. That's why I call for "Alumni Back to Home". I hope that alumni, especially at USU's FK, can contribute to the process of transforming faculties and universities," said the USU Rector. USU Public Relations - The new board of the Alumni Association of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara (IKAL FK USU) for the period 2021-2026 was officially inaugurated on Sunday (12/12/2021) at the USU FK Hall. USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in his remarks congratulated and hoped that the new management would be able to carry out the mandate of the deliberation.

The Rector also invited USU Medical Faculty alumni to contribute to the development of the faculty in particular and the university in general. He said that the current role of alumni is very influential in USU's efforts to be better in the future.

 “The role of alumni today is very important in the development of universities and faculties. That's why I call for "Alumni Back to Home". I hope that alumni, especially at USU's FK, can contribute to the process of transforming faculties and universities," he said.

 He gave an example of the role of alumni in advancing several leading universities in Indonesia. With alumni who contribute to the development of the university, it is possible to expand the network and utilize resources, thereby increasing the reputation of the university itself.

 “We can see how the alumni union at UGM, UI, and ITB is very solid and solid. They strengthen each other and help each other. Their role is to absorb fresh graduates, so the unemployment rate is quite small. On the other hand, the role of alumni is also to open the university network so that it can improve its reputation," he said.

 He has high hopes that the management of IKAL FK USU is able to contribute to the progress of the university. With the "Alumni Back to Home" Movement, he hopes that alumni will collaborate in the progress of USU.

 “As far as I know, most competent doctors in North Sumatra are USU graduates. This means that the potential is huge. Therefore, I really hope that alumni collaboration with universities will be well established," he said.

 Specifically for USU Medical Faculty alumni, he appealed to synergize and collaborate in advancing the USU Teaching Hospital. He hopes that the alumni can also strengthen and help improve services at the hospital. As is known, USU also has a partnership with Haji Adam Malik Hospital. So according to him, the collaboration between the two hospitals needs to be improved.

 “I hope that USU Hospital and HAM Hospital can collaborate and synergize. The role of alumni in it is the main key, so that these two hospitals do not compete, but strengthen each other," he concluded.

The inauguration itself is also combined with webinar activities. Also present were the Director of Haji Adam Malik Hospital, the Director of the USU Hospital, the Dean and Deputy Dean of the USU Medical Faculty, USU IKAL administrators, and USU Medical Faculty students. (©ULC)
