"Choosing USU on this visit because we saw that USU with its public relations had achieved brilliant achievements, so we rushed to immediately invite the Head of Public Relations of UPI to visit USU," he added.

HUMAS USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from the Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) and conducted a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with the topics of discussion on Secretarial Management, Protocol and Public Relations.

The FGD activity took place on Thursday (09/22/2022) at the Arya Duta Hotel Medan, and continued with a visit to USU to see several workspaces in the Rector's Bureau and at the same time introduce them, one of which is the public relations office and the administration room.

After visiting several workspaces in the Rector's Bureau, guests from UPI were invited to tour around the USU campus accompanied by the Head of Public Relations Amalia Meutia, M Psi, a Psychologist.

Secretary of UPI University, Prof. Dr. Memmen Kustiawan, SE, M.Sc., Ak., MH hopes that after this visit all positive information from USU can be organized later at UPI.

"Choosing USU on this visit because we saw that USU with its public relations had achieved brilliant achievements, so we rushed to directly invite the head of UPI's public relations to visit USU," he added.

On the same occasion Prof. Dr. Deni Darmawan, M.Sc. as the Head of Public Relations of UPI expressed his opinion that USU is extraordinary. Later UPI will learn from the process, program, and of course its achievements.

"USU is extraordinary, we must compare it to something better between us. Of course whoever it is we will study and learn. Hopefully later UPI will be even more extraordinary," he said.

Head of USU Public Relations Amalia Meutia, M Psi, Psychologist added that the UPI campus is also one of the universities with the legal entity of PTN-BH, of course it is among the best.

Head of USU Public Relations also said that in conducting this discussion, USU certainly learned many things from UPI, so that they could learn from each other.

"I hope that the initiation of this friendship does not stop here, God willing, in the future we will continue to establish friendships in various kinds of activities or also programs that will bring the good names of these two universities," she said. (©ULC)
