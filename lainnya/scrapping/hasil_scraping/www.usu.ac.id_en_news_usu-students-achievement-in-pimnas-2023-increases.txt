The increase in the graph of student achievement at PIMNAS 36 in 2023 is a benchmark that the development of our student achievements has led to the right direction, only consistency and improvement, and solid cooperation are needed so that our students continue to excel, said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The achievements of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) students have increased in the 36th National Student Science Week (PIMNAS) in 2023 which was held at Universitas Padjajaran, Bandung. After in the previous year USU only got 1 bronze and 1 favorite champion, now USU brings three medals, namely 2 silver medals and 1 favorite champion. Not only that, USU also won 2nd and 3rd place for the new non-PIMNAS event this year.

USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., said USU is committed to continuing to foster sustainable student achievement. PIMNAS itself is a fairly tight competition and requires careful preparation.

“The increase in the graph of student achievement in PIMNAS 36 in 2023 is a benchmark that the development of our student achievements has led to the right direction, only consistency and improvement and solid cooperation are needed so that our students continue to excel,” he said.

To the USU delegates, whether they won medals or not, the rector thanked them for their efforts. To those who won medals, hopefully in the future they can become mentors for their younger siblings, while those who have not had the experience of national competition can be used as part of the character building of a tough learner for future provision.

“We should encourage and trust the USU Team to win the PIMNAS 2023 medal. The long process of selection and competition followed at PIMNAS will provide many lessons and experiences for USU to improve the acquisition of champions in 2024,” he said.

Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, M.A. said that the strategy of fostering and managing outstanding student seeds through the PKM Center and Corner began to reap good results.

“We will conduct an evaluation of this year's results and will prepare for a tiered process of receiving and evaluating student proposals for the 37th PIMNAS event, which will be held by Universitas Airlangga in Surabaya next year,” he said.

Dr. Edy explained to all students who have participated in the PKM process (starting from PKP 1 to Pimnas) will get SKS recognition in each study program in accordance with national and internal USU policies. In addition, for those who get medals at PIMNAS, USU will give prizes in the night of achievement awards which will be held in mid-December.

“The Rector and all elements of leadership would like to thank the dedication and hard work of all students, accompanying lecturers, coaches, PKM Center and Corner, and the Directorate of Student Achievement who have brought the good name of the Universitas Sumatera Utara,” he said.

The USU students who won medals included the Toba Ecotherapy Team: “Pusat Rehabilitasi Berbasis Green Architecture sebagai Upaya Penyembuhan Diri Demi Mewujudkan Indonesia Bersih Narkoba” with Team Leader Mhd. Irsan (FT), Members Ichsannuddin (FT), Indah Mutya Sari (FT), M. Tito Apriandi Nasution (FT), Abdillah Thoha (FT) for the PKM-VGK Poster Silver Medal Category.
