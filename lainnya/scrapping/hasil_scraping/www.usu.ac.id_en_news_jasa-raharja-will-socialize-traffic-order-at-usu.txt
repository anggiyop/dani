The Rector said that during the visit there was a socialization carried out by Jasa Raharja regarding traffic rules to scheduling tree planting to be carried out by Jasa Raharja at USU.

PR USU - Rector of the University of North Sumatra (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Sc., received an audience from the Jasa Raharja group. The activity took place in the Rector's Audience Room of the Central Administration Bureau on Tuesday, (8/2/2022). The visit discussed the cooperation that will be carried out by USU with Jasa Raharja.

The Rector said that during the visit there was a socialization carried out by Jasa Raharja regarding traffic rules to scheduling tree planting to be carried out by Jasa Raharja at USU.

"Earlier we talked about cooperation, earlier, Jasa Raharja was socialized to students about the proper use of traffic," he said.

The Rector explained that the tree planting that will be carried out by USU and Jasa Raharja on the USU campus is a manifestation of Jasa Raharja's concern for the environment.

"There will also be a schedule for planting trees around the USU campus from Jasa Raharja as a form of concern for the environment," explained the Rector.

On the same occasion, Thamrin Silalahi as Branch Head of PT Jasa Raharja North Sumatra as well as an alumni of the USU Faculty of Engineering said that the Rector had approved several programs implemented by Jasa Raharja.

According to Thamrin, universities play an active role in carrying out strategic initiative performance programs on how Medan will be able to reduce the number of traffic accidents that are often experienced by students.

"As the data submitted by us shows that the accident rate is students and students, we think that universities are very active in how we receive input from universities to carry out strategic initiative performance programs," Thamrin said.

In addition, Thamrin expects the help of the rector and his staff to disseminate information to students or the people of North Sumatra in order to increase public compliance in paying motorized taxes.

"The level of public compliance to pay motorized taxes in North Sumatra is still very low compared to other provinces. We hope that assistance from the Rector and his staff will be able to disseminate information to students, including the people of North Sumatra," he said. (©ULC)
