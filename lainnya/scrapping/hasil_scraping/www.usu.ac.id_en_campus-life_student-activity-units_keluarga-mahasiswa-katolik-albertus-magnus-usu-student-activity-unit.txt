About Keluarga Mahasiswa Katolik Albertus Magnus USU Student Activity Unit

This student activity unit, which has been established for over thirty years, serves as a gathering place for Catholic students at USU. This student activity unit carries the motto "AD MAIOREM DEI GLORIAM," which means "For the Greater Glory of God." As a religious student activity unit, this student activity unit hopes for the realization of Catholic students who have strong faith and hold high values of fraternity and intellectualism, as well as understanding and implementing the teachings of the Catholic Church's social doctrine. This student activity unit also actively organizes religious activities on important Catholic occasions. This student activity unit provides an appropriate platform for Catholic students at USU to come together and practice Catholic teachings.
