Fiora Patricia Br Ginting, a member of the USU SPIRIT CLUB and a student of the Faculty of Economics and Business at the Universitas Sumatera Utara, became the first champion of the Nommensen Games Taekwondo Championship in early 2023. The Rector's Cup of HKBP Nommensen University Medan, Indonesia, was up for grabs. On March 18-19, 2023, the HKBP Nommensen University Auditorium Building hosted the National Championship match for two days.

This event drew 80 contestants from all around Indonesia, and Fiora took first position after passing through stringent matches and selection. Fiora's struggle to win the game was accompanied by extensive training and methods.

Fiora's participation in numerous SPIRIT Club activities also helped her win.

Fiora was also chosen to attend a program at the University of Lisbon in Portugal, which is scheduled for September 11-15, 2023. Fiora's role as an agent of change in changing a person's perspective on physical activity will be presented later during the training, and one of Fiora's tasks will be to explain in front of other SPIRIT Project partners from Portugal, Spain, Cyprus, India, and Sri Lanka how to keep the SPIRIT Club can be continuously developed at Universitas Sumatera Utara. Other excellent members of the USU SPIRIT Club who attended the training in Portugal included Dessy Ramasari (Faculty of Dentistry) and Risris Salmah Andrian (Faculty of Cultural Sciences) of Universitas Sumatera Utara.
