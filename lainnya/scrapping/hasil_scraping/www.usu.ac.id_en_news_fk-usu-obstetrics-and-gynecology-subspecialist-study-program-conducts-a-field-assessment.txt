“So our current task is to validate whether what is written is in accordance with the reality in the field,” said Prof. Dwiana, who was met at the opening of the field assessment at FK USU.

 

Public Relations USU - The Obstetrics and Gynecology Subspecialist Study Program of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara (FK USU) conducted a field assessment attended by a team of assessors from the Indonesian Institute for Self-Accreditation of Higher Education in Health (LAM-PTKes). This assessment aims to see the performance that has been done. It was held for 3 days from April 13-15. This assessment was opened in the FK USU Hall, 3rd floor, on Monday (14/04/2025).

 

The experienced LAMP-PTKes assessor team who attended this field assessment were Prof. Dr. dr. Dwiana Ocviyanti, Sp.OG (K), MPH from the University of Indonesia (UI) and Dr. dr. H. Nasrudin, A.M, Sp.OG (K) MARS, M.Sc., FISQua from Universitas Muslim Indonesia (UMI). The assessors will provide constructive input to the FK USU Obstetrics and Gynecology Subspecialist Study Program.

 

In his remarks, Prof. Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., Vice Rector I of USU, said that the presence of the assessors is good because they will provide advice related to the development of the study program. This is to increase public confidence in the graduates produced.

 

“Ensuring that the educational programs we run have high standards to carry out operational activities and professional services, and produce competent medical personnel,” said Prof. Edy.

 

Dean of FK USU, Prof. Dr. dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe, Sp.S (K) said he would accept all suggestions, input and criticism from the assessor team. This supports the study program's quality in a better future direction. “There is input that we get from this experienced assessor team so that we can make improvements so that this study program is getting better every day,” he said.

 

The assessor team, Prof. Dr. Dwiana Ocviyanti, Sp.OG(K), MPH, said there were two stages in the accreditation process: the first stage of adequacy assessment and the second stage of field assessment. In the sufficiency assessment stage, the study program uploads the required files and documents. In the field assessment stage, the assessor team reviews the documents to be validated.

 

“So our current task is to validate whether what is written is in accordance with the reality in the field,” said Prof. Dwiana, who was met at the opening of the field assessment at FK USU.

 

In line with that, Dr. dr. H. Nasrudin, A.M, Sp.OG (K) MARS, M.Sc., FISQua, the assessor team will see this field assessment in 9 assessment indicators. These assessment indicators are the vision and mission of the study program, resources, facilities, and infrastructure, outputs, and others. “Of course, how is the commitment to the vision and mission of the study program, its resources, infrastructure, student outcomes, and governance,” said Dr. Nasrudin.
