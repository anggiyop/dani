Untung Yowono said that USU, as one of the hosts for the UTBK implementation had carried out well. He really appreciates the efforts and services that USU has carried out.

USUPR-The Test Institute for Collage Entry (LTMPT) monitors and evaluates the implementation of the Computer-Based Written Examination (UTBK) at USU, Friday (20/5/2022). Untung Yowono, as an assessor, reviewed the implementation at several points where the exam was held.

Untung Yowono said that USU as one of the hosts for the UTBK implementation had carried out well. He really appreciates the efforts and services that USU has carried out.

“I have carried out monitoring at several points here, and from everything I have seen, USU has prepared well for the implementation of this UTBK. Supporting facilities for the prevention of Covid-19 are also available such as distance between participants, washing hands, and toilets. Everything has met the standards that we expect," said Untung.

He also mentioned that this illustrates the coordination and communication of the UTBK implementation going well. Even though North Sumatra, especially USU, was one of the hosts with the most participants, it could be handled well.

“North Sumatra is the largest UTBK participant, including here at USU. But seeing the preparations made, I believe there will be no problems. As was also conveyed to me, throughout the implementation until today there have been no problems. We hope that UTBK this time can run well," he said.

He appealed to USU to maintain the quality of service for the implementation of the UTBK. Fortunately, it gives a message that exam participants' cheating is increasingly diverse at this time. This requires special attention from the committee and the exam supervisor.

“I received several reports elsewhere if the cheating of the examinees is getting more diverse. There are even modifications to the shirt's buttons, replaced with a camera lens. Some of them have communication devices installed in their bodies, some have their computers hacked. Various modes are carried out by participants. I hope that the committee and supervisors at USU remain focused so that such fraud does not happen here,” said Untung.

Present to accompany the Head of the USU Academic Bureau Muhammad Zulham, SE, M.Si along with Teuku Faisal and Andi Siswoyo. In addition, the USU Head of Public Relations, Promotion and Protocol, Amalia Meutia M.Psi., a psychologist, was also present.
