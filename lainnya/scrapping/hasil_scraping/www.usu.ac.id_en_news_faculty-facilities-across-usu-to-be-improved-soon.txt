MEDAN - PR: Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin stressed that the facilities in each faculty will soon be improved to support the world class university program.

MEDAN - PR: Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr Muryanto Amin emphasized that the facilities in each faculty will be immediately improved to support the world class university program.

He explained this when describing the university's priority programs during his working visit to the USU Faculty of Engineering, Friday (18/6/2021).

Dr. Mury explained that currently USU has mapped and re-planned the master plan for the construction of the USU Padangbulan Campus. He named the team the Exist Team.

“This Exist Team will make the plan, so the faculties in the data, starting from the area to the infrastructure available in it, the Faculty of Engineering is among those who will receive attention,” he said.

Apart from the Faculty of Engineering, there are also the Faculty of Economics and Business, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Faculty of Humanities and Faculty of Agriculture. Improving infrastructure in each faculty is an investment so that in the next five years USU's reputation will be strong at the international level.

On that occasion, the rector also emphasized other programs that need to be boosted by the faculty, including reactivating the web or faculty and study program pages.

“I want there to be standardization. And bilingual, not only in Indonesian but also in English. This is important to attract students from abroad,” he said.

The governance and priority programs must be done together. His visit to the Faculty of Engineering was the seventh faculty visited in the Rector's Working Visit to Faculty program.

Dean of Engineering, Dr Ir Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM said that the priority programs presented by the rector were very good for preparing future programs. “We understand which ones need to be prioritized and can be aligned with the program from the USU Rector,” he said.

Dr. Fahmi confirmed that his party is ready to support the rector's program, especially in the development of the faculty towards a world class university. Programs at the Faculty of Engineering will be mixed and matched so that they can become a unity to achieve common goals.

“Thank you to the rector and his team for the visit, and we hope that discussions like this can be improved so that the integration of work programs can be implemented and applied properly,” he said.

Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Z Hasibuan SSi, MSi, Apt, Vice Rector IV Prof Dr. Drs Opim Salim Sitompul, MSc, Vice Rector V Ir Luhut Sihombing, MP, Head of the Information Systems Center Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, ST, MMIT and the ranks of FT USU Vice Deans.
