“This hearing is a discussion of friendship between Telkom Property and USU. Some of the things discussed earlier, such as maintenance management of a building, continue to create a building management ecosystem that is more environmentally friendly and has a digital basis,” the Rector said.

The concept of digital learning center building promoted by USU is pollution-free. The plan, the campus area will be filled with cyclists and pedestrians.

"We actually want to create a pollution-free concept, so we will create a concept for this academic area using bicycles and walking," Muryanto Amin explained.
