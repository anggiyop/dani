“We hope to accelerate the publication of paper publications through the publisher talents we have so that it can be a source of inspiration for many people and can have a good effect on society,” said Meutia.

USU PR - With the theme “Hirilization of Innovation Research for Community Economic Empowerment and Environmental Sustainability Through Community Service”, the 11th National Seminar on the Results of Community Service Activities in 2024 at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) was successfully held in hybrid manner at the D.H Penny Building, Faculty of Agriculture USU and Zoom Meeting, on Wednesday, (06/11/2024).

This seminar invited 2 speakers who are prominent in their fields, namely, Prof. Abdul Rauf from the Universitas Sumatera Utara and Prof. I Ketut Widnyana from Universitas Mahasaraswati who is also a DRTPM Service Reviewer.

This activity takes place every year and includes not only USU but also various other universities. As a forum for community service activities for lecturers to disseminate the results of activities, Dr. Meutia Nauly, S. Psi., M.Si., Psychologist, as Secretary of LPPM USU, hopes that this seminar will continue and continue to strive to improve cooperation with LIPHKI so that the publishing process is faster.

“We hope to accelerate the publication of paper publications through our publisher talents so that they can be a source of inspiration for many people and can have a good effect on society,” said Meutia.

The topic chosen for this seminar is in line with one of the government's programs, namely product hirilization. These products are the result of lecturers' research that is applied in the community through community service activities. In addition to being a forum, according to the Chairperson of the Committee for the Seminar on the Results of Community Service Activities, Prof. Dr. Ir. Elisa Julianti, M. Si., this seminar is also a place to exchange information between lecturers related to community service products that have been carried out previously.

Furthermore, Prof. Elisa hopes that more people will read the results of community service activities and be inspired by the many results of lecturer research that can be applied to the community. Prof. Dr. Ir. Nevy Diana Hanafi, S.Pt., M.Si., IPM, as the Secretary of the Committee also through this activity can make us move to the community, including how to get closer to the community so as to have a positive influence on the community.

“In addition, it is also hoped that this activity can provide inspiration to new lecturers as a reference for serving the community,” added the Secretary of the Committee.

The research results or papers produced will then be published in the Proceeding Conference Series Talenta and for papers that are successfully selected will be further published in the Journal of Saintech Transfer Talenta Publisher USU.
