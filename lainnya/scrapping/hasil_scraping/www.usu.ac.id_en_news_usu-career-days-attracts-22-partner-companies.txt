"Alhamdulillah, it is growing, and today, there are 22 companies that are pleased to attend and help facilitate alumni's job searches," said Vice Rector III.

USU PR - The Innovation Research Development Agency (BPRI) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held Career Days together with PT Indonesia Maxi Dinamika to open opportunities for alumni to find jobs. Career Days were held for 2 (two) days at Pancasila Building, on Friday-Saturday (26-27/01/2024).

Job Fair, which has changed its name to Career Days, is an opportunity for USU alumni to get a job according to their competencies and interests. This event is a bridge connecting alumni and job seekers with companies providing employment, which is expected to make it easier for HRD to select applicants according to the required criteria. This opportunity is also used for students to find information about internships.

Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation, Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., Apt. explained that this activity must be utilized properly because it develops skills, hones talents, and achieves success in the professional world. Currently, the number of USU Career Days registrants registered online is 2,500 people.

“Alhamdulillah, it is growing, and today, there are 22 companies that are pleased to attend and help facilitate alumni to get jobs,” said Vice Rector III.

Head of BPRI USU, Buchari, S.T., M.Kes., said that in this Career Days there are 22 partner companies from national and multinational that open opportunities and provide positions for USU alumni.

“There are about 22 partners. From plantation companies, aviation, banking, pharmaceuticals, education, finance, and so on,” said Buchari.

Manager of Entrepreneurship and Career Development, Drs. Ami Dilham, M. Si., said that alumni must know and learn the things needed by the company.

“And also for alumni, yes, try to learn what the company wants. This means not what we want, but 'what the company asks for in the world of work,'” he said.

Head of Manpower Placement, Duma Gultom, hopes that after this activity takes place, a report will be made to find out the placement of workers. Duma added that it can reduce the unemployment rate in Medan City.

“So we hope that the implementation of this activity can recruit as many workers as possible. Especially residents of Medan City,” he said.
