The Rector of USU said that this inauguration was part of the infrastructure revitalization within USU. Infrastructure is one of the main focuses put forward in the rector's work program.

MEDAN-PR USU: The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr Muryanto Amin, S Sos, M Si, inaugurated the organic and inorganic chemistry laboratory building Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) USU. The inauguration was held on Wednesday (16/2/2022) in the courtyard of the USU FMIPA park.

The Chancellor of USU said that this inauguration was part of the infrastructure revitalization within USU. Infrastructure is one of the main focuses in the rector's work program.

"After I was inaugurated, infrastructure arrangement became one of my main focuses. For that, I did 'blusukan' to all faculties. The results I obtained were that several faculties needed an immediate revitalization touch. One of them is FMIPA. I still see many poor facilities here and need to be repaired," said the Chancellor of USU.

He added that FMIPA is one of the faculties with a large number of laboratories. This shows that the teaching and learning process in FMIPA intersects with the use of laboratories.

"The laboratory is the main thing at FMIPA because many student activities are spent in the laboratory. For that, I convey that laboratory repair is a top priority. So that students can be comfortable in learning," he added.

He said that the repair and revitalization in the USU FMIPA area would be carried out in stages. It is done because many other infrastructure will also be repaired.

"In addition to the development that we will continue to strive for, maintenance is the main thing. The Dean and the entire FMIPA academic community must carry out maintenance. Don't build it and leave it alone," he said.

Meanwhile, the Dean of USU's FMIPA, Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu M.Sc. expressed his gratitude for the rectorate's support in improving FMIPA. He said that this organic and inorganic chemistry laboratory had long been expected to exist.

"Previously, this organic and inorganic chemistry laboratory experienced a fire accident in 2006, charred without residue. Actually, the redevelopment proposal was completed in 2010, but there are quite several obstacles. Alhamdulillah construction started in 2021 and be completed in early 2022," said Dr. Nursahara.

Present at the meeting were USU Vice-Rector I Dr Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, Vice Chancellor IV Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc, Vice-Rector V Ir Luhut Sihombing, MP, University Secretary Prof. Dr.dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), Sp.OG (K), the deputy deans, lecturers, and education staff in the USU FMIPA environment. (RR)
