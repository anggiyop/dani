Several agreements are collaborated with California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSBs), carrying out two collaborations. The first is students exchange between USU and CSUBs.

An appropriate study program and curriculum exploration will be determined on this occasion.

"Next is the University of California, Irvine (UCI), which is willing to host USU students in the Student Mobility Program. Then with the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy (IMT), USU will conduct a pre-selection to recommend prospective doctoral students for USU Masters graduates and USU lecturers who wish to continue their Magister program in Italy. The final committee at IMT will select these candidates, and those who pass will be given a full scholarship to continue their Ph.D. at IMT," explained the Rector.
