"The areas that will be discussed in this conference are specifically about how the government must quickly change into an adaptive government so that it is able to overcome in a short period problems that threaten human life, both regarding health, food, the threat of war, and natural disasters. , said the Dean of USU's FISIP.

PR USU - Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, Universitas Sumatera Utara (FISIP USU) held the 4th International Conference on Social and Political Development (ICOSOP) with the title "Human Security and Agile Government". The activity took place at Aston Hotel Medan on Wednesday (18/05/2022).

The 2022 ICOSOP conference discusses how to deal with threats and human sustainability. In addition, it also discusses how the government can be adaptive and responsive to overcome these problems. This is in accordance with what was conveyed by the Dean of USU's FISIP, Dr. Hendra Harahap M.Si, Ph.D who is also the Chair of the 2022 ICOSOP Conference.

"The areas that will be discussed in this conference are specifically about how the government must quickly change into an adaptive government so that it is able to overcome in a short period problems that threaten human life, both regarding health, food, the threat of war, and natural disasters. , said the Dean of USU's FISIP.

In addition, he also hopes that ICOSOP 4 will be able to educate the government, especially the North Sumatra government.

"This conference is in collaboration with the North Sumatra government. We hope this will be a good education for the North Sumatra government and practitioners, leaders, academics, and students," said Hendra Harahap.

The Vice-Rector (VR) IV Prof. Dr. Drs. Opim Salim Sitompul M.Sc said that a government with resilience, resilience, and adaptability in dealing with the era of disruption is why the title Human Security and Agile Government was appointed at ICOSOP 4.

"Now changes are happening quickly. With the industrial revolution 4.0, then the changes that occur and the disruptions that occur in the current era are very great and occur in all aspects, including government services," said VR IV USU.

On that occasion, USU's VR II Muhammad Arifin Nasution S.Sos., M.SP said that research has an important role in the development process of USU. This is because research is the beginning when you want to develop something.

“When asked about the role, it must be very important because we should start from research if we develop something. So we need to explore everything, look for data and so on and then analyze it. All of that was later found in the research," said USU's WR II.

For information, ICOSOP 4 was held two years after ICOSOP 3 was held in 2019, which discussed "Social Engineering Governance for People, Technology, and Infrastructure in Revolution Industry 4.0".
