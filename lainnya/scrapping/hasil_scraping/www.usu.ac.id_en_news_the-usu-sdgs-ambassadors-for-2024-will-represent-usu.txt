"In the future, a coach will guide the selected students. Congratulations to all the finalists, and I hope this activity can continue," said Prof. Poppy.

USU PR — After going through the classroom selection stage, the ten finalists of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) Ambassador Selection for 2024 have now entered the final round, namely the Speech Contest on SDGs. The selection occurred at the GBPA USU Video Conference Room on Monday (Apr. 29).

 

During the event, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation of USU, announced that out of the ten finalists, 3 USU SDGs Ambassadors would be selected to represent USU in the International SDGs Competition. In addition to this honor, the selected Ambassadors would receive a stipend to support their participation in the International SDGs Competition.

 

"In the future, a coach will guide the selected students. Congratulations to all the finalists, and I hope this activity can continue," said Prof. Poppy.

 

Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., M.T., Director of the Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships at USU, stated that this was the first time USU held the selection of SDGs Ambassadors involving students. This step was taken as a form of USU's support as an educational institution towards achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

 

"We certainly hope that students can actively and passively contribute to the achievement of the 17 SDGs, so we held this selection of Ambassadors to inspire other students," said Prof. Himsar.

 

Siti Nur Salsabila from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Batch 2023, who was selected as the main SDGs Ambassador for USU, expressed her preparation for the long process she had to go through, including an English proficiency test, psychological test, and SDGs assessment. This included preparing a speech that addressed SDG 5, which is gender equality.

 

"I don't agree with the patriarchal system that exists in Indonesia, where women are always considered inferior. There is a strong patriarchal influence in my own family, but I want us all to break free from that system," explained Siti.

 

Haris Fadhillah Nasution from Civil Engineering, Batch 2021, who was selected as the SDGs Ambassador for SDG 2, expressed his hope to bring his innovative ideas to the international level.

 

In line with that, Enrico Franditho Sihombing from the Faculty of Medicine, Batch 2022, the SDGs Ambassador for SDG 3, hoped to become a positive example that inspires other students at USU to participate in achieving the SDGs and to make USU proud at the international level.

 

"I hope that we, as SDGs Ambassadors, can be an example for other students at USU and bring about positive changes," said Enrico.
