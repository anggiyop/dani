PR USU - The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenkes-RI) held a field verification of the Teaching Hospital of the University of North Sumatra (USU) Hospital. The activity took place online through a virtual zoom meeting on Wednesday (8/3/2022).

This field verification is a stage that the USU Hospital must go through to get the status of a teaching hospital. In his remarks, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that this is in accordance with Government Regulation No. 93 of 2015 concerning Standard Guidelines and Classification of Hospitals accepting students obligate to verify.

"This is part of the flow or stages that the USU Hospital must go through to get the status as an Educational Hospital which will be determined by the Indonesian Ministry of Health in accordance with applicable regulations," the Rector explained.

It is hoped that the verification of the USU Hospital will run smoothly so that it is entitled to the status of a teaching hospital. The Rector explained that later this status could provide legitimacy and legality for USU Hospital in carrying out its duties as a hospital that supports the academic learning process at USU and provides health services to people in Medan, North Sumatra, and Indonesia.

"We certainly want this status to provide legitimacy and legality for the USU Hospital to carry out its duties as a hospital that fully supports the academic learning process at USU," he said.

The Assessor Team, namely dr. Else Mutiara Sihotang, Sp.PK who is the Head of the Working Team for the Management of Educational Vehicles and Education Hospitals at the Ministry of Health, said that according to the regulations stipulated as a teaching hospital, it must obtain a determination from the minister of health.

According to Else, USU Hospital has adequate infrastructure and human resources to be designated as a teaching hospital. Later, the assessor team will assess whether the USU Hospital has met the standards as a satellite hospital.

"From the point of view of infrastructure, then in terms of human resources, it is quite qualified to be designated as a teaching hospital," she explained. Else hopes that USU Hospital can become the main teaching hospital that provides doctor education and specialist doctor education for USU Medical Faculty. (©ULC)
