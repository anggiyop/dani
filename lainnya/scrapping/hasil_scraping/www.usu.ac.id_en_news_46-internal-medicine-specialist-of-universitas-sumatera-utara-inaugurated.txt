"With more and more doctors who have completed their specialist education, the imbalance in the proportion of medical personnel in urban and suburban and rural areas can gradually be addressed," said Muryanto.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) inaugurated 46 Internal Medicine Specialists, as well as held the introduction of 24 participants of the New Specialist Doctor Education Program (PPDS). The event was held in a hybrid manner at the Tiara International Convention Center, Sunday (11/21/2021).

"Through this inauguration, we can be a little relieved because there has been an increase in the number of internal medicine specialists, which until now the number is still relatively small when compared to the various cases of internal medicine experienced by the community," said USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Sc.

The Rector said, from this small number, the existing internal medicine doctors are still concentrated in urban areas, so that people who live in suburban and rural areas cannot enjoy these professional services.

"With more and more doctors who have completed their specialist education, the imbalance in the proportion of medical personnel in urban and suburban and rural areas can gradually be addressed," said Muryanto.

He said the inaugurated specialists have the responsibility to improve the health status of the community while still prioritizing collaboration between institutions and elements of society in the level of practice and socialization.

Muryanto also congratulated the new PPDS who had graduated and were about to attend education.

"My message is, study well, seriously and creatively, so as to be able to produce superior innovations in the medical field, which will not only benefit the general public, but also personally benefit your own life," he said.

Also present at the inauguration, Deputy Dean 1 of USU Medical Faculty, dr. H. Delyuzar, M.Ked (PA)., Sp.PA(K), Chairman of the Indonesian Association of Internal Medicine Specialists (PAPDI) represented by dr. Ariantho, Head of Internal Medicine Study Program, Dr. dr. Taufik Sungkar, M.Ked(PD), Sp.PD-KGEH, Chair of the Committee Dr. Dina Aprilia Ariestine, M.Ked (PD), Sp-PD-KGer, Secretary of the Department and Secretary of Study Programs, Professors and Staff at the Department of IPD .
