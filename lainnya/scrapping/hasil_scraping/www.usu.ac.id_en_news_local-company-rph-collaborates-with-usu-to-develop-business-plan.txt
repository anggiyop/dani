“RPH determines in advance what program and form of business will be created, then from these various problems it will be identified how it will be designed. For example, they want to process meat and sell ingredients such as meatballs,” explained Muryanto.

USU PR - The Slaughterhouse Regional Company (PD RPH) cooperates with the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) to develop the company business plan.

Meeting the USU Rector at the USU Rector's Office House, Wednesday (11/10/2021), the Managing Director (Director) of the Slaughterhouse, Harisandi Syafril Harahap said his party wanted to cooperate with universities, especially USU, for business development in the abattoir.

"We want to collaborate with USU to develop the potential in the RPH, USU can provide input and ideas so that the RPH can develop and rise again," said Harisandi.

With the innovation and creativity provided by the USU academic community, Harisandi believes that the potentials of RPH can be optimized to the maximum. For example, land in RPH that has not been used.

“There is a lot of land that can be used for new business development. USU students or lecturers might be able to do research to see that potential,” he continued.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., welcomed the offer of cooperation. Muryanto said USU would assist in the assessment and make a detailed business plan for business development.

“RPH determines in advance what program and form of business will be created, then from these various problems will be identified how the design will be. For example, they want to process meat and sell ingredients such as meatballs,” explained Muryanto.

Lecturers and students will be sent directly to identify the program designed to make a business plan. "This can also be a project based learning for students," said Mury.

Mury hopes that the technical implementation will be discussed further after determining the program and making the MoU. "Hopefully, this collaboration can be a program that is beneficial for both parties, USU and RPH. It can be realized to help RPH become more developed,” he concluded. (©ULC)
