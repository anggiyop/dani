USU PR The USU Innovation Research Development Agency (BPRI) held a "PPBT / PPBR Proposal Preparation Assistance" workshop in collaboration with the National Innovation Research Agency (BRIN). The event was held in the Academic Senate Room of the Rector Bureau of the University of North Sumatra on July 27, 2023. USU Vice Chancellor III, Prof Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, M.Si, Apt, inaugurated it.

The activity featured three speakers: the Coordinator of the PPBT / PBBR Incubation Function - BRIN Dr. Ferry Ramadhan, ST, M.Si, CoFounder CV Artsari Prof. Ir. Lilis Sukeksi, M.Sc, Ph.D. (USU Inventor), and CoFounder CV Gaharu Wana Insani Dr. Ridwanti Batubara S.Hut., MP.

BRIN is the coordinator of the PPBT / PBBR Incubation Function. As the first speaker, Dr. Ferry Ramadhan, ST, M.Si presented his material titled "Funding Program and Incubation Assistance RIIM PPBR (RIIM STARTUP) BRIN." He emphasized the rising number of intellectual unemployment in Indonesia due to graduates who are only interested in finding work (job seeker) rather than creating jobs (job creator).

The Technology-Based Startup Company (PPBT) is a continuation of a program run by the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education since 2013, which is a funding scheme for technology-based startup entrepreneurs through incubator institutions. The goal is for them to grow and improve their capabilities, which will help the community's economy and increase the competitiveness of domestic industries. This incubation program assists startup companies in commercializing their inventions to the intended market, specifically through the incubator's incubation process, which includes mentoring, guidance, training, product development facilitation, and access to financial institutions and marketing. It is given to technology-based start-up companies for them to improve their operations and increase the competitiveness of their products and services.

Government assistance is provided through this funding program to increase the commercialization of invention results with a mature level of technological readiness. The funded innovation products are focused on products already at TKT 8 and must be refined to TKT 9. This startup incubation funding program is expected to bridge the gap for startups to enter the market optimally.

A research-based start-up company is a group of people who work together to create a new start-up company with products or services based on research findings. The Research-Based Start-up Funding Programme is a program that assists Research-Based Start-up Companies or prospective Research-Based Start-up Companies in becoming research-based start-up companies that are self-sufficient, profitable, and have the potential to be sustainable.
