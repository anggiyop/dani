USU’s Independent Student Selections/ Seleksi Mahasiswa Mandiri (SMM) pathway in 2023 is opened for 49 study programs. Among the programs with the greatest number of enthusiasts, the law program had 1,380 participants, the medical education program had 1,257 participants, and the management program had 885 participants.

MEDAN - USU PR: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Computer-Based Written Test/Ujian Tulis Berbasis Komputer (UTBK) for the Independent Student Selection (SMM) pathway in 2023 on the first day, Saturday (07/15/2023). UTBK was attended by 6,314 participants, who will fill 40 percent of the capacity of the SMM pathway provided by USU, or around 2,137 seats. The exam will last until July 21, 2023.

USU Chancellor, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, accompanied by the Vice Chancellors, the University Secretary, and the UTBK SMM committee, directly reviewed the implementation of the exam in three locations, namely at the Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences and Faculty of Economics and Business of USU. The locations used to implement UTBK SMM are 13 faculties in the USU environment. The Rector hopes that UTBK can run smoothly until the last day.

The number of applicants for the USU SMM pathway in 2023 decreased compared to the previous year. This is because USU no longer opens the D3 independent pathway this year. "In the past, the number of SMM registrants reached more than 8 thousand. Currently, D3 has been included in SNBP and SNBT, so of course, it affects the number of applicants in the SMM pathway," said Prof. Muryanto Amin.

According to him, this SMM pathway is the last opportunity USU gives for high school / vocational school graduates who have yet to pass the previous SNBP and SNBT pathways. "We hope those unsuccessful yesterday can enter USU through this pathway. Hopefully, this selection can also attract students who have the potential to achieve achievements for USU," said the Rector.

The USU SMM pathway in 2023 is open to 49 study programs at Universitas Sumatera Utara. The highest number of enthusiasts, as many as 1,380 participants for the law study program, 1,257 for the medical education study program, and 885 for the management study program.

UTBK implementation is held in three separate sessions: session 1, which starts at 06.30 WIB; Session 2, which starts at 10.15 WIB and Session 3, which starts at 14.15 WIB. The material in the UTBK questions consists of the Scholastic Potential Test, Indonesian Literacy Test, English Literacy, and Mathematical Reasoning. The results of the UTBK SMM USU selection will be announced on July 27, 2023.

According to the Rector, USU has improved the exam security system. "We have tightened the security system. Security or exam supervisors have been added to oversee the implementation of the exam, so it is hoped that there will be no more cases of cheating than in the implementation of the previous exam. We hope everything can run smoothly, and orderly, and safely," he said. (RJ)
