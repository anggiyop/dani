About SBPU Talenta

The USU TALENTA Excellent Achievement-Based Selection (SBPU TALENTA) is a program that filters prospective students of Universitas Sumatera Utara who have talents/achievements in the academic and non-academic fields or have special talents recognized at the national or international level. It is conducted to look for prospective students with good character and achievements in their area of interest and talent they master. Hopefully, it can improve the quality of successor students at Universitas Sumatera Utara and provide more excellent opportunities and benefits to students who are motivated to hone their abilities to study at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). Based on the Regulation of the Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) on New Student Admissions through the USU TALENTA Excellent Achievement-Based Selection Pathway, it was explained that new student admissions through the USU TALENTA Excellent Achievement-Based Selection (SBPU TALENTA) is a new student admission pathway of USU whose results are ratified through a Decree of the Rector and organized by university-level committee. For those of you who want to submit proof of achievement, for that, an original certificate is needed from the institution organizing the competition. Some achievements that meet the selection requirements are Hifzhil Qur'an, Musabaqah Tilawatil Quran (MTQ), Pesta Paduan Suara Gerejawi (Pesparawi), competitions in science and humanities, etc. The purpose of implementing SBPU TALENTA USU is to provide opportunities for outstanding students to develop at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), improve the quality of new USU students, appreciate outstanding students in academic and non-academic fields, and provide motivation to students to maintain their achievements.

The capacity of the USU TALENTA Excellent Achievement-Based Selection (SBPU TALENTA) is a maximum of 0.5% of the new student admissions quota.
