"The more partners, the more students will have the opportunity to experience internships, so they don't only get theory in class but experience the world of work firsthand," said the Rector's Expert Staff for Cooperation, Siti Salmiah, drg, Sp KGA.

The Universitas Sumatera Utara continues to increase its partners in the Independent Campus Independent Learning Program (MBKM) to be able to accommodate internship students.

"The more partners, the more students will have the opportunity to experience internships, so they not only get theory in class but experience the world of work firsthand," said the Expert Staff of the Rector for Cooperation Siti Salmiah, drg, Sp KGA, in a meeting related to the Implementation of the MBKM Program between USU with PT Pegadaian (Persero) and PT Brand Indah Lestari, Monday (10/25/2021).

To date, there are 16 partners who will join the USU MBKM program. It is hoped that the number and quota will increase, because the MBKM program is one of the achievements of the university. On the same occasion, Expert Staff of the Rector for Academic Affairs Reni Asmara Ariga, S.Kp, MARS said, USU also facilitated all study programs so that they could participate in the MBKM Program through the Dean, Deputy Dean, Head of Study Programs and Secretary of Study Programs.

"Academic advisory lecturers will be activated to re-identify what courses can be recognized according to internship activities," she said.

This is in accordance with the regulations conveyed by the Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology who wants to be able to give students a different experience without being limited by a particular study program.

In line with this, the Head of the Educational Service and Development Unit, Prof. Dr. Dwi Suryanto, M.Sc hopes that students from all study programs can take part in general internship programs, such as at Pegadaian and PT Brand Indah Lestari.

“PT Brand Indah Lestari and PT Pegadaian are expected to cooperate with all study programs. Partners describe what courses are related to activities, to make it easier to recognize courses," he explained.

From PT Pegadaian, Assistant Manager II of the Hub Division was present. Institutional Arinda Wati Sipahutar. He appreciated USU students who have good competence in internships at PT Pegadaian. PT Pegadaian has conducted MBKM for one semester which focuses on increasing student competence and creativity in marketing and sales programs.

Meanwhile, from PT Brand Indah Lestari, President Director Eddy Tanoto and Marketing Executive Jemario Mestika were present. PT Brand Indah Lestari, which is designing MBKM activities, would be very proud if this collaboration could be realized. (©ULC)
