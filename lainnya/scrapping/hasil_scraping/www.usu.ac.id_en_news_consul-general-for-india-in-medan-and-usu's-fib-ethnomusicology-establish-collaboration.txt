"Our study program has world music learning materials in which Indian classical music is one of them. We think we can establish a lot of cooperation with the Consul General," said the Head of the Ethnomusicology Study Program.

PR USU - Afternoon meeting over high tea between the Indian Consulate General in Medan and the USU Ethnomusicology Study Program, which took place at the Indian Consulate General's Office in Medan, Jl. Archbishop no 19 Medan on Thursday (10/02). 2/2022), resulted in an agreement to establish potential collaboration between the two parties.

"Our study program has World Music learning materials, including Indian classical music. We think we can collaborate with the Consul General," said the Head of the Ethnomusicology Study Program, Rithaony Hutajulu.

Rithaony added, as a discipline that focuses on music in a cultural context, ethnomusicology is concerned with and has an interest in learning, researching, and developing the Indian classical music tradition.

"We really appreciate the visit of the USU FIB Ethnomusicology Study Program. As you said earlier, we can do a lot of collaboration to build mutual understanding, especially in the cultural aspect," said the Consul General of India, Shubham Singh.

In the Covid-19 pandemic situation, Shubham added, there were difficulties bringing in classical music practitioners directly from India. However, the Consul General will seek virtual activities, including bringing in Indian musicians in Medan to share their knowledge with the Ethnomusicology Study Program.

"We also invite the involvement of the Consulate General of India in the 2022 Toba Caldera World Music International Festival (TCWMF) in July," Rithaony invited.

As is known, TCWMF is an annual international-class activity initiated by Rithaony and (late) Irwansyah Harahap to promote the Toba Caldera as a priority tourist destination for the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of the Republic of Indonesia.

"Of course, we will be involved. I will involve Indian musicians to enliven the event. We also have an ICCR scholarship program, please follow if interested," concluded Shubham.

According to Shubham Singh, he has a good impression on USU, moreover, he also communicates intensely with the Rector of USU, Dr Muryanto Amin.

At the end of the meeting, the Indian Consulate General also invited the USU FIB Ethnomusicology Study Program to be directly involved in the Indian Independence Day Celebration on 15 August.

Also present at the meeting, the Secretary of the Ethnomusicology Study Program, Arifni Netrirosa, SST MA, and the teaching staff of Ahmad Arief Tarigan.
