"Furthermore, there are also USU students who have participated in internships at BPJS Employment, as one of the manifestations of MBKM, so that the students can develop their skills and experiences," Prof. Muryanto expressed.

USU PR — The Rector Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, held a meeting with the Director of Finance of BPJS Employment, Asep Rahmat Suwandha. Besides discussing ongoing cooperation, the meeting also served as a gathering ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. It took place in the Rector's Audience Room on Wednesday (Mar. 21)

The USU Rector welcomed the efforts to develop cooperation with BPJS Employment, which will focus on reactivating the USU center for workforce-related innovation. The Rector also emphasized the importance of students in this process and revealed that several students have participated in internships at BPJS Employment.

"Furthermore, there are also USU students who have participated in internships at BPJS Employment, as one of the manifestations of MBKM, so that the students can develop their skills and experiences," Prof. Muryanto expressed.

During the meeting, the USU Rector expressed his hope to enhance the cooperation between USU and BPJS Employment, especially regarding research and the development of membership within the campus community. Additionally, cooperation in research was also a focus of the discussion.

Asep Rahmat Suwandha appreciated USU's cooperation in ensuring that all campus community workers are registered as BPJS Employment participants. Furthermore, symbolic aid was also provided to the families of BPJS Employment participants who have passed away, including scholarships for two out of three children left behind.

"First and foremost, we appreciate the Rector and his team because the cooperation has been good. All workers who were previously not protected within the USU community are now fully registered as participants of BPJS Employment," said Asep.

In the meeting, BPJS Employment hoped that USU could facilitate data regarding vulnerable workers in North Sumatra. This data is expected to help integrate information scattered across various sectors. Both parties agreed that cooperation between BPJS Employment and USU should be strengthened.

"We hope that USU can facilitate data on vulnerable workers in North Sumatra, including their locations and ages. This way, we can integrate the data currently scattered across different sectors," explained Asep.

Asep Rahmat Suwandha also emphasized that the campus is a strategic partner for BPJS Employment in formulating data-based policies and conducting academic scientific studies. This joint effort is expected to advance social security programs and strengthen worker protection within USU and throughout North Sumatra.

"In essence, we want the cooperation between BPJS Employment and USU to be even better in the future because the campus is one of our strategic partners in formulating work plans and policies based on data and academic scientific studies," Asep hoped.
