About PRAMUKA USU Student Activity Unit

PRAMUKA USU is an organization that provides opportunities for USU students to engage in scouting activities and character development. Through PRAMUKA USU, students can learn about scouting values, wilderness survival skills, leadership, teamwork, and community service. Members of PRAMUKA USU are guided to become individuals who are resilient, responsible, and ready to face various challenges in life. PRAMUKA USU is also actively involved in social activities, such as community service carried out at the end of 2021, where the PRAMUKA USU team collaborated with the community of Silalahi II Village in cleaning up the village area and constructing waste disposal facilities in several locations. Joining PRAMUKA USU can provide valuable experiences, expand social networks, and develop a strong character for students.
