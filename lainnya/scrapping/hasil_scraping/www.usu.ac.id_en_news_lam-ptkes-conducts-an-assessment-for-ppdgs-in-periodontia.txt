This field evaluation is a required cycle for the Specialists Doctors and Dentist Study Programs (PPDGS) in Periodontia, Faculty of Dentistry USU. We are hoping for "Excellent" accreditation for this study program. And we are aware that the two LAM-PTKes assessors came here to take images after obtaining documentation in the form of forms. Everything has been set up by the Faculty so that we can hopefully achieve our goal of receiving higher certification in this accreditation, according to Vice-Rector I.

PR USU: On Monday, May 15, 2023, at the Nazir Alwi Building, Faculty of Dentistry, USU, the Indonesian Institute for Self-Accreditation of Higher Education in Health (LAM-PTKes) conducted a field assessment for the Specialist Doctors and Dentist Study Programs (PPDGS) in Periodontia. Two LAM-PTKes assessors, Prof. Dr. drg. Sudibyo, Sp.Perio (K), and Dr. drg. Yanti Rusyanti, M.Kes., Sp.Perio(K) was featured in this activity.

The Specialists Doctors and Dentist Study Programs (PPDGS) in Periodontia, Faculty of Dentistry USU, according to Vice-Rector for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, conducted this field assessment to receive the "Excellent" accreditation. Two LAM-PTKes evaluators came to take images directly after receiving forms as evaluation materials in the past.

"This field evaluation is a required cycle for the Specialists Doctors and Dentist Study Programs (PPDGS) in Periodontia, Faculty of Dentistry USU. We are hoping for "Excellent" accreditation for this study program. And we are aware that the two LAM-PTKes assessors came here to take images after obtaining documentation in the form of forms. Everything has been set up by the Faculty so that we can hopefully reach our goal of receiving “Excellent” accreditation in this accreditation, according to Dr. Edy.

The Specialist Doctors and Dentist Study Programs (PPDGS) in Periodontia had made many preparations, including providing new facilities, in anticipation of this accreditation examination, according to Dr. Essie Octiara, dean of the USU Faculty of Dentistry.

The Dean stated that "the preparation for the form team has actually been more than a year, and if we look at it, as the assessor said, coincidentally, the assessors, five years ago also accredited it, there have been many changes, especially in the system of facilities and infrastructure that we have available and that is indeed in boring,"

Furthermore, considering the pressing need for specialists in this area, the Dean expects this study program to be accredited as "Excellent" and expand its staff.

"What we hope to accomplish is that this accreditation will eventually be rated "Excellent. To maintain the 1:3 staff-to-student ratio, the new staff may allow more kids to enroll. Because specialists are required, particularly periodontia specialists, to give services to the community, according to the Ministry of Health," he stated.

Head of the Specialist Doctors and Dentist Study Programs (PPDGS) in Periodontia at the USU Faculty of Dentistry, Aini Hariyani Nasution, drg., Sp. Perio (K) stated that the study program had previously gained accreditation and was re-accredited for better outcomes.

"This accreditation is the study program's second experience with it; the prior accreditation resulted in a B grade. The PS has improved in various ways over time, so of course, we hope that superior accreditation will result from this round of accreditation," stated the Head of the PPDGS in Periodontia.
