Muhamad Suhairi Lubis S.Fil., the chairman of the PW ISNU North Sumatra Inauguration Committee, said that this collaboration will result in several activities, including the inauguration of the regional board of ISNU for the 2024-2029 term. In addition to the inauguration, ISNU will also hold a seminar with the theme "Diversity in Harmony Towards a Blessed North Sumatra."
