The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) launched (launching) a long-distance (online) health service platform for Covid-19 sufferers who are undergoing self-isolation or known as telemedicine, in the peak event of USU's 69th Anniversary which was held in a hybrid manner, Tuesday (21 /9/2021)

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said, COVID-19 telemedicine is a form of USU community service, especially to help Covid-19 patients. With this service, Covid-19 patients do not need to go to the hospital and can consult and get medicine delivered directly to the patient's address.

Muryanto explained, Covid-19 sufferers just need to access the hospital-sumut.usu.ac.id page to get treatment and treatment.

This program is expected to help people who have been exposed to the virus that started in Wuhan, China.

“The Covid-19 Telemedicine Program is the result of collaboration between the Medan City Government, the North Sumatra Provincial Government, USU and the Indonesian Doctors Association," said the former USU FISIP Dean.

Telemedicine, added the Rector, is also clear evidence of the successful collaboration between the government, universities and the community.

“By collaborating, we prove that we can create programs that can be directly felt by the community. So this telemedicine has a very significant impact, especially to reduce the number of Covid-19, "he said.

The launch of the USU Covid-19 Telemedicine program was symbolically carried out by North Sumatra Governor Edy Rahmayadi, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin and Medan Mayor Bobby Nasution in celebration of USU's 69th Anniversary with the theme "Working Together to Protect Our Health Against the Covid-19 Threats.”

President Joko Widodo who was present gave his speech hoping that USU would take advantage of the momentum of the anniversary to strengthen internationalization steps so that USU would become a center for the development of superior science, technology, and innovation.

Also congratulating USU were Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Panjaitan, Mendikbudristek Nadiem Anwar Makarim, government stakeholders and university rectors throughout Indonesia. (©ULC)
