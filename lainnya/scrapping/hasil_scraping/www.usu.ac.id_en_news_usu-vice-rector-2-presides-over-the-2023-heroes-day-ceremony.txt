We must not give up on overcoming poverty and ignorance in the Republic of Indonesia and hope that through USU, with education, we can overcome these problems," said Vice Rector 2.

USU PR - Vice Rector 2 of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Muhammad Arifin Nasution S.Sos., M.SP., led the ceremony commemorating Heroes' Day 2023 with the theme "The Spirit of Heroes for the Future of the Nation in Fighting Poverty and Ignorance" which took place in the courtyard of the USU Central Administration Bureau Building, Friday (11/10/2023).

Muhammad Arifin Nasution S.Sos., M.SP., read a mandate from the Minister of Social Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, Tri Rismaharini, who said that the theme was taken because it saw modern colonization that was increasingly evident. Indonesia is a large market and is blessed with many extraordinary natural resources ranging from fertile land, abundant marine products, earth content that stores a variety of minerals so that this is a challenge for the next generation to be able to manage all natural resources properly.

Through written remarks, Minister Tri Rismaharini explained that heroes are people who stand out because of their courage and sacrifice in defending the truth in the interests of the Nation and State above personal or group interests. Heroes are also figures who teach us that we are not a nation of losers and will not be willing to give up so easily and must face the threats and challenges that exist.

Therefore, all elements of society throughout the archipelago must join hands in order to melt into one and the spirit to eradicate ignorance and poverty in the country. We must apply the spirit of the nation's heroes who refused to lose and surrender to circumstances to realize a united, sovereign, just and prosperous national life.

USU Vice Rector 2 also added that USU is a forum that can help the next generation to overcome poverty and improve quality education in Indonesia so that we together build Indonesia to be more advanced and prosperous.

"We must not give up on overcoming poverty and ignorance in the Republic of Indonesia and hopefully through USU with education we can overcome these problems," said Vice Rector 2.
