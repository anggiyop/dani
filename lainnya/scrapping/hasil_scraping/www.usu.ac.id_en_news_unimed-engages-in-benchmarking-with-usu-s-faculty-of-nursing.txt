So, when there is benchmarking, we are very happy because it will refresh our knowledge about ZI-WBK. It also provides inspiration to face new challenges in achieving ZI-WBK-WBBM," explained Dr. Dudut

In a proactive move towards enhancing integrity and clean governance in academic settings, the Faculty of Nursing at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) welcomed a working visit from Universitas Negeri Medan (Unimed) for benchmarking in the context of the Zone of Integrity, Free Corruption Area (ZI-WBK). The event took place at the Auditorium of the Faculty of Nursing, USU, on Thursday (Jan. 18/ 2024).﻿

During the meeting, there was an exchange of information and experiences related to the implementation of the Zone of Integrity, Free Corruption Area. The purpose of the visit was to engage in discussions that would provide broader insights and strengthen the commitment to creating an academic environment free from corruption.

Dr. Dudut Tanjung, S.Kp., M.Kep., Sp.KMB, the Dean of the Faculty of Nursing at USU, expressed the significance of the visit. He highlighted that after ZI-WBK, the next step would be ZI-WBK-WBBM (Zone of Integrity, Free Corruption Area, and Clean Bureaucracy Service Area). The Faculty of Nursing at USU aims to gain new insights and face new challenges in achieving ZI-WBK-WBBM.

Dr. Dudut emphasized that benchmarking from another institution to the Faculty of Nursing at USU provides a refreshing perspective on ZI-WBK. Additionally, the visit is considered a source of inspiration, marking a positive step in the development of integrity and clean service in the academic environment.

"So, when there is benchmarking, we are very happy because it will refresh our knowledge about ZI-WBK. It also provides inspiration to face new challenges in achieving ZI-WBK-WBBM," explained Dr. Dudut.

Prof. Dr. Muhammad Yusuf, S.Si., M.Si., the Coordinator of the Center for Bureaucratic Reform at UNIMED, expressed a keen interest in gaining a deep understanding of the implementation of ZI-WBK carried out by the Faculty of Nursing at USU. He highlighted the importance of obtaining ZI-WBK certification from the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform (Kemenpan RB) as a desired achievement.

"We want to learn here how ZI-WBK works and follow the experiences of the Faculty of Nursing at USU on how they obtained certification from Kemenpan RB," said Prof. Yusuf.

Furthermore, Prof. Yusuf also focused on the successful experience of the Faculty of Nursing at USU in obtaining ZI-WBK certification and expressed a desire to understand the strategies, tricks, and steps taken by the Faculty of Nursing at USU in achieving ZI-WBK.

"In the future, at Unimed, we will invite the Faculty of Nursing at USU for a sharing session regarding the steps for implementing the ZI-WBK knowledge," added Prof. Yusuf.
