“Do not make fasting an excuse to reduce work enthusiasm. Instead, this is a moment to improve discipline, maintain effectiveness, and remain productive in the midst of the atmosphere of Ramadan,” he added.

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) emphasizes its commitment to maintaining tolerance in the academic environment through the Morning Apple. This activity is a momentum to strengthen the solidarity of the academic community, especially in welcoming the blessed holy month of Ramadan. It took place in the courtyard of the USU Rectorate Bureau, on Monday (3/03/2025).

In his mandate, Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, S.T., MM.IT., as Head of the USU Priority Program Evaluation Agency, emphasized the importance of tolerance as a fundamental value that the entire academic community must uphold. He invited all elements of the campus to create a comfortable and empathetic atmosphere for those who practice fasting.

“Tolerance is not just about respect, but also about love and care for others,” he said.

As a form of support for work effectiveness during Ramadan, USU also adjusted the operating hours of administrative services. Working hours Monday to Thursday are set from 08.00 to 15.00 WIB, with a break at 12.30 to 13.00 WIB. Meanwhile, working hours last until 15.30 WIB on Friday, with a break time of 12.00 to 13.00 WIB.

Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar emphasized that this adjustment balances work productivity and comfort in worship. He hopes all USU employees will remain enthusiastic in working, even though they are fasting.

“Do not make fasting an excuse to reduce work enthusiasm. Instead, this is a moment to improve discipline, maintain effectiveness, and remain productive in the midst of the atmosphere of Ramadan,” he added.

As a campus that upholds diversity, USU strives to be an example in building interfaith harmony. This morning assembly is a reflection for all academicians that diversity is a strength that must be maintained and celebrated.

At this moment, USU reaffirms its commitment to creating an academic environment that supports character development and tolerance values. In the spirit of Ramadan, it is hoped that all elements of the campus can build USU as an educational center oriented towards harmony and mutual progress.
