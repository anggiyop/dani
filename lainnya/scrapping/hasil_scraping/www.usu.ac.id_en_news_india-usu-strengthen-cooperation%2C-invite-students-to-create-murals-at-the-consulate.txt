USU PR - The Indian government wants to strengthen cooperation with the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) which has been established so far. India even officially invited USU students to draw murals at the Indian Consulate Office in Medan and be involved in cultural arts performances on India's Independence Day which was celebrated in Medan.

The Indian Consul for Medan City, Shubham Singh during his visit to USU, Thursday (12/2/2021) said he hoped that intense communication could be established with USU soon.

His party opened itself up so that USU could propose a cooperation that might be held in the near future.

"Please tell us the form of cooperation that we can implement immediately. We will complete both the letter and the proposal later," said Shubham.

On that occasion, Shubham invited USU to be able to participate in the plan of the Indian Consulate in Medan City which will erect a mural wall in its consulate office area.

The Indian Consulate means that the presence of the USU mural on the wall will be a symbol of the closeness of the Government of India to Indonesia, especially higher education institutions in the city of Medan.

“I prepared a wall for a mural. I hope the campus in Medan City can send students to draw the mural. The mural depicts the concept of the relationship between the Government of India and the Government of Indonesia. I hope from USU I can participate,” he said.

In addition, Subham also invites USU to participate in the celebration of India's Independence Day which will be held on January 26, 2022. In the celebration, Indian cultural performances will be displayed. The Indian consul also hopes that USU can participate and also display Indonesian cultural performances.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. warmly welcomed the offer of cooperation from the Government of India.

He explained that USU is committed to creating a warm and sustainable atmosphere with all USU partners, especially foreign partners.

Accompanied by USU Vice Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt, and the Head of USU's Office of International Affairs (KUI), Dr Esther Sorta Mauli Nababan, M.Sc., the Rector assessed that the visit of the Indian Consul had strengthened USU's relationship with the Government of India.

"We hope to put this cooperation in the form of an MoU and other forms," ​​said the Rector.

Responding to an invitation from the Indian Consulate in Medan regarding the making of a mural, the former USU FISIP Dean said that USU students would join in the plan to make a wall mural of the Indian Consulate.

“We will join to participate in the mural that will be held at the Indian Consulate. In addition, we also greatly appreciate the invitation to participate in the celebration of India's independence day. We will prepare students to be able to join in performing cultural performances,” Muryanto emphasized. (©ULC)
