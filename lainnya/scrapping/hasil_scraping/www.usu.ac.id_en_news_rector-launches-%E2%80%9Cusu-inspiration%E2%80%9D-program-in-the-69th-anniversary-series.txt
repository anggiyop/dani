Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., launched the “USU Inspiration” program in a series of celebrations for USU’s 69th Anniversary, Friday (8/20/2021). The Rector said the “USU Inspiration” program was intended so that USU is able to continue to accept ideas related to higher education issues so that they could then transform into the best in all lines.

“We will carry out this activity, which we call the USU Inspiration on a regular basis. This USU Inspiration is expected to be able to generate ideas especially in the framework of advancing USU in all lines,” he said. He explained that the participants in this activity are the deans or the leadership of faculties and universities. The goal is that leaders are able to understand issues and apply managerial functions to each unit they lead as a whole.

In the inaugural USU Inspiration program which coincided with the date of the founding of USU, the theme of Digital Transformation: The Role of Universities in Preparing Super Smart Society 5.0 for Indonesia Gold 2045. The discussion was moderated by Vice Rector IV Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, MSc, presented two keynote speakers including Prof. dr. Ir. Marsudi Wahyu Kismoro, IPU (Chairman of the Indonesian Informatics Expert Board of Trustees) and Prof. Dr. M. Suyanto, MM (Rector of AMIKOM Yogyakarta).  

Dr. Mury said, the theme of digitization was raised so that USU immediately transformed from analog to digital. “Rapid changes force us to transform from analog to digital. This changes mus be responded to so that our work to advance USU can be easier,” he said.

To the two keynote speakers, the Rector hoped to provide input to USU, especially in the stage of transformation of higher education digitalization. “The inspiration from the two keynote speakers at the inaugural event of USU Inspiration is expected to be able for us to translate and realize it in our daily live,” he said. USU is also expected by the Rector to be a smart digital user. “If we cannot create, at least we must be able to become smart digital users. Adaptive to technological changes and continue to learn until we become the best,” he emphasized.  

USU’s Inspiration, he added, was USU’s transformation effort towards a better direction. “So that nothing becomes something, what is already something becomes more something,” Dr.Muryanto Amin said. (©ULC)
