the SPIRIT Club in collaboration with the Indonesian Doctors Association, the Indonesian Association of Clinical Nutritionists (PDGKI) North Sumatera branch, the Indonesian Association of Medical Nutrition Doctors (PDGMI) North Sumatera branch, and the Indonesian Pediatrician Association held a Scientific Seminar entitled: The Role of Nutrition and Physical Activity as a Treatment and Preventive in Stunting and Malnutrition.

Non-communicable diseases are diseases that cause high mortality and morbidity in the world. This is also the highest ranking in Indonesia, and prevention of this disease should be done early. Non-communicable diseases including obesity, hypertension or coronary heart disease are caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. Based on research this is not only caused by a lack of physical activity or improper food intake, but also caused by a lack of proper nutrition in the first 1000 days of life. This is also the beginning of stunting in children, which is also the beginning of non-communicable diseases, namely obesity in adulthood.

This understanding needs to be extended especially to general practitioners and paramedics. For this reason, the SPIRIT Club in collaboration with the Indonesian Doctors Association, the Indonesian Association of Clinical Nutritionists (PDGKI) North Sumatera branch, the Indonesian Association of Medical Nutrition Doctors (PDGMI) North Sumatera branch, and the Indonesian Pediatrician Association held a Scientific Seminar entitled: The Role of Nutrition and Physical Activity as a Treatment and Preventive in Stunting and Malnutrition. In addition, the SPIRIT Club is also with the Department of Nutrition, USU's Faculty of Medicine by involving all doctors and paramedics in the hospital. Prof. Chairuddin P Lubis USU, and H. Adam Malik Hospital Medan, together with the sponsor, namely Fresenius Kabi thoroughly discussed the role of nutrition and exercise. This seminar also provides credit points from IDI of 4 SKP for seminar participants.

The scientific seminar was held on Saturday, March 11, 2023, at the RS. Prof. Chairuddin P Lubis USU. The speakers who were involved were dr. Winra Pratita, M. Ked (Ped), SpA(K), Prof. Dr. dr. Dina Keumala Sari, M. Nutrition, SpGK(K), dr. Fitriyani Nasution, M. Nutrition, SPGK(K), dr. Hilna Khairunnisa Shalihat, M. Nutrition, SpGK, dr. Sudirman Parningotan Sinaga, MKM, SpKFR(K). This seminar was attended by 60 participants from various medical backgrounds.

It is hoped that through this seminar, the dissemination of the SPIRIT Project funded by Erasmus Plus can be conveyed which emphasizes the importance of proper exercise and good nutrition in preventing non-communicable diseases. Universitas Sumatera Utara SPIRIT Club, which became the driving force for holding this seminar, consists of students who pay attention to the prevention of non-communicable diseases. Stunting in childhood will cause problems in adulthood, such as obesity. It is hoped that the involvement of SPIRIT Club as an agent of change will form a generation that understands the prevention of this non-communicable disease.
