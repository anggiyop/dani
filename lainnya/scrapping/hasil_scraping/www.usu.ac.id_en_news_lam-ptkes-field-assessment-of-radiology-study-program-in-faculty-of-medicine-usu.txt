"We hope that this activity will give good results for the accreditation assessment of the USU FK Radiology Study Program, so that it can further increase the trust of the people who choose this study program as the best professional educational institution for their children," the Rector said.

The activity took place in the USU Medical Faculty hall on Monday, (8/8/2022). This field assessment is a stage in the accreditation assessment process for the USU Medical Faculty Radiology Study Program.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S. Sos., M.Si in his speech said that later the good assessment obtained by the USU Medical Faculty Radiology Study Program could increase public confidence in choosing this study program as the best professional education institute.

"We hope that this activity will give good results for the accreditation assessment of the USU FK Radiology Study Program, so that it can further increase the trust of the people who choose this study program as the best professional educational institution for their children," the Rector said.

The Rector hopes that the Radiology Study Program accreditation assessment can increase the enthusiasm of lecturers and students in scoring achievements in both academic and non-academic fields. In addition, they can contribute by dedicating their competencies to improve overall public health.

"It is also equally important to contribute and dedicate one's abilities and expertise to the humanitarian aspect, especially helping in terms of fulfilling the overall improvement of public health," he said.

On the same occasion, one of the assessors, Prof. Dr. dr. Yuyun Yueniwati, P.W., M.Kes, Sp. Rad (K) explained that the minimum accreditation assessment is an accreditation assessment that must be passed by a new study program. Although there are 9 criteria, there are differences in the components assessed. (©ULC)
