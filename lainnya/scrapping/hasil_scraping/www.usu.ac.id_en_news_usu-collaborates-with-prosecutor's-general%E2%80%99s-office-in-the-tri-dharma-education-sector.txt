"If there are problems related to USU, we can provide legal assistance," he said.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatra Utara (USU) cooperates with the North Sumatra Prosecutor General’s Office (Kejaksaan Tinggi Sumatera Utara) in the field of Tri Dharma, namely research, learning, community service and institutional development.

This was stated in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by the Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si with the Head of North Sumatra Prosecutor General’s Office (Kajati) IBN Wiswantanu SH., M.H located at North Sumatra Prosecutor General’s Office, Wednesday (26/01/2022).

IBN Wiswantanu, said that there were many useful things that could be done with USU. One of them is in terms of authority. The Prosecutor General’s Office can accompany and provide legal assistance to USU if needed.

"If there are problems related to USU, we can provide legal assistance," he said.

Meanwhile, related to the prosecutor's task, which requires many experts in the trial, USU can send experts who can provide information related to a problem being handled.

"Experts from USU can serve as expert witnesses at the trial, providing the necessary information to strengthen the evidence," he said.

He added that all officers within the jurisdiction of the North Sumatra High Court would participate in all activities related to education, training, and requests for experts from USU.

"Synergy and collaboration in carrying out tasks are essential to be able to accelerate the acceleration of the completion of joint tasks," he said.

Not only that, the USU Chancellor said that in terms of professionalism in increasing the human resources of the North Sumatra High Court, USU will create a particular class to educate the prosecutor's officers.

"We make a special class. The prosecutor's office can continue their studies to the S2 or S3 level," he said.

In addition to participating in resource improvement programs, Dr. Muryanto said, USU is also ready to synergize in various programs in line with the Tridharma of Higher Education.

"We can strengthen many things to advance the welfare of the community, especially in the North Sumatra area," he said.
