Digital educational games are considered very useful for children to form awareness of the dangers of earthquakes by using game media that are made interesting and illustrative, to stimulate thinking power, including increasing concentration and problem solving.

SDIT (Integrated Islamic Private Primary School) Siti Hajar, which is located at Jalan Letjen Jaming Ginting, Medan Tuntungan, is one of the best elementary schools in North Sumatra. SDIT Siti Hajar students are young children who still lack knowledge about the dangers of natural disasters and how to overcome them.

Therefore, the Universitas Sumatera Utara lecturer team conducted community service activities with the theme "Increasing Earthquake Alertness in Early Childhood through Digital Educational Game Media" at SDIT Siti Hajar. Digital educational games are considered very useful for children to form awareness of the dangers of earthquakes by using game media that are made interesting and illustrative, to stimulate thinking power, including increasing concentration and problem solving.

The Universitas Sumatera Utara Community Service Team in this case was represented by Ir. Rahmi Karolina, S.T., M.T., IPM, Hilma Tamiami Fachrudin, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D, GP and Indra Aulia, S.TI, M.Kom, CIAR, who is a teaching staff at the Department of Civil Engineering, Department of Architecture and Department of Information Technology, Universitas Sumatera Utara. They were assisted by three students from the Civil Engineering Department, namely Annisa Tanurin Nasution, Luthfiah Khairunnisa and Siti Maulida Hasni.

The Principal of SDIT Siti Hajar, Rahmad Martuah, S.Sn, MPd, along with teachers and staff at SDIT Siti Hajar welcomed this activity. The socialization was held on Friday, September 30, 2022, beginning with an explanation of the earthquake and its impacts, as well as preparations for dealing with it. From the socialization, it is known that many students do not know what actions to take when an earthquake occurs. Whereas knowledge about the dangers of earthquakes must be given from an early age, for example, such as conducting socialization on earthquake awareness with educational game media.

The Universitas Sumatera Utara Community Service Team hopes that early childhood will have the character of being aware of the dangers of earthquakes, so that they can prepare themselves when a disaster occurs. This digital educational game is now available on playstore and can be downloaded under the name Aku Anak Siaga Hadapi Gempa (I am an Alert Kid Facing Earthquake). (RJ – ©ULC)
