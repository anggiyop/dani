"This activity is part of the work plan for extending the MoU with USU, particularly in the field of education," Defrian explained.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has extended its collaboration with the National Police Headquarters (Mabes Polri). The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, aiming to enhance the quality of human resources (HR) at both institutions.

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in his speech, emphasized the significance of this collaboration for USU as a legal entity public university (PTN-BH). He noted that support from the National Police Headquarters is crucial, especially in providing experts from various fields, such as law, medicine, and sociology, to offer opinions in cases requiring specialized expertise.

"We had one public lecture with the police before, but it did not continue. We hope to resume such activities after this MoU," said Prof. Muryanto.

Meanwhile, Kombespol Defrian Donimando, S.I.K., M.H., Head of the Legal Education and Training Division at the National Police Human Resources Bureau, explained that this MoU continues previous collaborations and is aligned with the Tridarma of Higher Education—education, research, and community service. The goal is to create a closer synergy between USU and the National Police Headquarters.

"This activity is part of the work plan for extending the MoU with USU, particularly in the field of education," Defrian explained.

During the same meeting, both parties also discussed the importance of adapting to rapid changes in times and technology. Changes in human behavior demand a more strategic role for the police. The MoU is expected to lead to various joint activities, such as public lectures, collaborative research, and community service. Both sides are also committed to drafting a more technical cooperation agreement to ensure the effective implementation of this collaboration and to benefit both parties.
