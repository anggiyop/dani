USU PUBLIC RELATIONS – Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) through the Assisted Village program will form an Integrated Agribusiness Area Master Plan Team in STM Hulu District, Deliserdang Regency. This was conveyed by the Vice Rector III of USU, Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., Apt in response to the aspirations of the people in the seven sub-district villages.

Dr. Poppy said that USU really appreciates the sincerity and cohesiveness of the STM Hulu community and the importance for universities in establishing two-way communication with the community.

“USU will immediately discuss the request for the preparation of the Master Plan - Integrated Agribusiness Area Program within USU, and will form a research team that can accommodate the aspirations of the community in the field," said Dr. Poppy with the team to see directly the agribusiness area in STM Hulu, last Saturday.

She also conveyed the importance of collaboration between academics – government – ​​business players, as well as elements of the mass media and the community, in realizing all of this.

“USU requested the assistance of the Head of Sub-district, Drs. Budiman Sembiring, MA so that he can help list the priority needs of the 7 villages that are intended to be considered in the USU Assisted Village Program," she said.

Previously, the Team Buah.com represented by Ir. Zein Ginting, MT as the Founder ofBuah.com conveyed the "Integrated Agribusiness Area" program which involved the community in 7 villages namely Rumah Rih, Durian Tinggung, Tanjung Muda, Tanjung Raja, Liang Muda, Liang Villages. Pematang and Bah Buntu Village.

“The Integrated Agribusiness Area Program is intended as a real work for all parties in a joint effort to improve the welfare of the community, especially the farmers in STM Upstream," she said.

In addition to asking USU for assistance in compiling a master plan for an integrated agribusiness area, he also asked for an active role from the USU Faculty of Agriculture to foster farmers at STM Upstream and develop kengkeng fruit commodities, taking into account that currently Indonesia is still importing 3.5 million tons (Equivalent with 150,000 ha of longan plantations) or as an import substitution so as to increase its economic value.

Secretary of USU's LPPM, Meutia Nauly, SPsi. MPsi emphasized the importance of the presence of the USU LPPM in encouraging the acceleration of village independence and starting LPPM activities in Liang Pematang Village as the most remote village so that later it could be used as a pilot project for other villages.

Deputy Dean III of the USU Faculty of Agriculture Prof. Dr. Ir Elisa Julianti, Msi stated firmly to be ready to help the community in realizing the "Agribusiness Integrated Area Program" either in the form of research activities or in the form of assistance.

“The USU Faculty of Agriculture will also invite other faculties within USU to be able to collaborate. USU's Faculty of Agriculture will also involve several study programs such as Agro Technology, Livestock, Agribusiness, Livestock, Food Technology, etc. to support the program," she said.

Meanwhile, the Deputy Chairperson of the USU Assisted Village, Destanul Aulia, SKM. MBA, MEc. Ph.D gave input so that the master plan that will be compiled is complete in terms of macro & micro, so that it can become a blue print in regional development activities.

The USU LPPM also invites Buah.com to cooperate in the preparation and supply of fresh fruit and healthy vegetables to hospitals in the city of Medan.

The Bank of North Sumatra, represented by Budi Heryanto, said it would support agribusiness activities at STM Hulu, Deliserang through loan programs and CSR. "Bank of North Sumatra has a CSR program that can be submitted by the community accompanied by recommendations from the relevant regional head," she said. (©ULC)
