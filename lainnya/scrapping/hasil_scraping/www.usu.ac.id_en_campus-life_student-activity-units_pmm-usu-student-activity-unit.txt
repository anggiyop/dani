About PMM USU Student Activity Unit

The Pengabdian Masyarakat Mahasiswa (PMM) USU Student Activity Unit, initially named Ikatan Mahasiswa Peduli Masyarakat (IMPM) USU, was established based on USU students' concern for the local and national community. This student activity unit has been officially recognized since at least 2014 under the name IMPM. Periodically, they often engage in community work and conservation activities in villages that require assistance, particularly in the North Sumatra region, as they did in the past in 2021 when they visited Sei Bamban Village, North Sumatra. Joining PMM USU can be a platform for USU students to learn to help each other and build relationships with new people.
