USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: PT. Pembangunan Almamater Sejahtera (PT PAS) carried out the handover of leadership positions. The handover from the old leadership was carried out in the Academic Senate Meeting Room, USU Central Administration Bureau, Thursday (8/5/2021). The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., along with USU's Vice Rector V, Ir. Luhut Sihombing, MP, witnessed the handover of the position.

New and old leaders from PT PAS attended. Dr. Drs. Ahmad Ridwan Siregar SH, MLib, as President Director was replaced by Ryalsyah Putra. Meanwhile, the President Commissioner is Doly Muhammad Jafar Dalimunte replacing Drs. M Lian Dalimunthe Ak, MEc. 

Ryalsyah in his statement said that the handover was a starting point for PT PAS to be able to make a greater contribution to USU. He said PT PAS has great resource potential. 

“PT PAS's potential is very large and it is very possible to continue to grow. So far, we have carried out many development and procurement projects within USU. So in the future we have to explore external projects," said Ryalsyah. 

Ryalsyah emphasized that PT PAS is here to contribute to USU, especially in providing input and income. According to him, the implementation of projects outside USU will provide a greater contribution to USU's income. 

"PT PAS is here to contribute, especially to increase USU's income and income. In addition, PT PAS is committed to encouraging the success of USU's performance under the leadership of Rector Muryanto Amin," he added. 

He gave an example of how UGM can grow as a university business entity whose products have been widely accepted in the community. According to him, USU can be at that level through PT PAS. 

“With the pandemic, it gives us the opportunity to do business that didn't exist before. Like UGM whose products have been accepted by the public, PT PAS hopes that our products can fulfill and be accepted by the community as well," he said. 

Ridwan Siregar, as President Director of PT PAS in the previous period, was optimistic that PT PAS would get better in the hands of the new officials. According to him, the energetic spirit of young people is able to create the glory of PT PAS. 

“This new PT PAS official is very young and energetic. We are optimistic that in their hands, PT PAS will be able to compete with other business entities. PT PAS as a business entity can develop far from what we expected," Ridwan said. 

Ryalsyah in his closing statement admitted that he would invite USU graduates to join PT PAS. He emphasized this as a strategic step for PT PAS to be able to take advantage of the potential of USU graduates. 

PT PAS was established on July 4, 2019 which is a legal entity from the business of the University of North Sumatra. PT PAS became a commercial business unit to encourage the growth of non-PNBP funds. The ownership of PT PAS is controlled by the University of North Sumatra with a percentage of shares of 95 percent. (RR/©ULC)
