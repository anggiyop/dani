VR IV hopes that later this field assessment can trigger USU's FKG to provide better services to students and the wider community. According to him, there is a challenge to improve performance to obtain the best accreditation.

USU PR - The Faculty of Dentistry (FKG) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Field Assessment Visitation for the Education and Professional Dentistry Study Program to accredit the USU FKG Orthodonesia Specialist Study Program. The event occurred in the Nazir Alwi Room of the USU FKG on Tuesday, (22/06/2022).

At the event, USU Vice-Rector IV Prof. Dr. Opim Sitompul, M.Sc said that the USU FKG Assessment Visitation was aimed at validating all activities at the USU FKG. The validation results will make the USU FKG Medical Profession Study Program obtain superior accreditation.

"Hopefully, the results will make the FKG medical professional study program with superior accreditation," said Prof. Opim.

VR IV hopes this field assessment can later trigger USU's FKG to provide better services to students and the wider community. According to him, there is a challenge to improve performance to obtain the best accreditation.

"So there is a kind of challenge to get the best accreditation to improve the performance of all of us," he said.

Head of the Assessment Team from the Independent Accreditation Institute for Health Higher Education (LAM-PTKes) Dr. drg. Haris Nasutianto, M.Kes., Sp.RKG(K) from Mahasarswati University Denpasar mentioned several stages contained in the criteria for this accreditation assessment. One of these stages is verifying and validating the documents carried out during the field assessment on 23-24 June. Furthermore, it will be assessed how the professional education system.

"So one of the stages of this accreditation assessment, we have received the document, we have reviewed it, after that, starting today, Thursday, Friday, we will conduct a field assessment. The field assessment is essentially verification and validation of the documents we have received, then we will see how the professional education system is," said drg. Haris.

Drg. Haris also explained that the assessment of the professional education system would be carried out by monitoring the RSGM and FKG students directly. It cannot be monitored through documents.

“For example, at the RSGM, how does the lecture system and so on work. Because things like that we can't see in the document. That's why when we have an assessment here tomorrow, students still have to keep going, so we'll see how the clinic looks like. We will take pictures of the whole thing apart from document verification and validation," he explained.

One of the Assessor Team Dr. drg Mia Damiyanti, MPd said that the USU FKG is one of the leading FKGs because it is the oldest in Sumatra.

“I think as one of the FKGs in Sumatra that has been the longest, of course it is quite prominent because there are also foreign students who study here. In my opinion, it is quite respectable," said drg. Mia.
