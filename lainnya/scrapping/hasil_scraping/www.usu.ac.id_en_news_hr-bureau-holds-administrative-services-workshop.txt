"This meeting is also intended as part of an activity to upgrade the quality of services provided by the USU HR Bureau," said Arifin Nasution.

PR USU – The Bureau of Human Resources (SDM) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Workshop on Administrative Services Proposal for Dismissal and Retirement of Civil Servants. The event took place at the USU Central Administration Bureau Building on Wednesday, (08/06/2022).

On this occasion, USU Vice-Rector II Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP. in his speech said that this event is part of the activities of the USU HR Bureau to improve the quality of services provided. It is in line with USU's commitment to meeting the demands of implementing bureaucratic reform.

"This meeting is also intended as part of an activity to upgrade the quality of services provided by the USU HR Bureau," said Arifin Nasution.

He also added that there are 3 important elements needed in manifesting bureaucratic reform: a clean bureaucracy, an accountable bureaucracy, and a bureaucracy capable of producing excellent and superior service.

"In realizing bureaucratic reform, there are 3 important elements that must be available, namely a clean bureaucracy, an accountable bureaucracy and a capable bureaucracy to produce excellent and superior service," he said.

On the same occasion, Associate Expert Staffing Analyst Muhammad Yasin, S.Sos this event was held because there are still frequent miscommunications or differences in perception about the data that needs to be completed regarding the administration of pension proposals. Therefore, this is the right moment to straighten things out regarding pension management.

“So far, there are still occasional miscommunications or differences in perception about the data that need to be completed in terms of pension proposals. It is the right moment, in my opinion, to straighten out the material requested to take care of the pension, namely A B C D,” he said.

BKN Associate Expert Staffing Analyst Thomas Agustianto said that the HR Bureau was very grateful for activities like this because the things that had been obstacles so far could be resolved. He also hopes that problems related to delays in dismissing civil servants will no longer exist by holding this activity.

"The HR bureau is very grateful for activities like this. Because whatever the obstacles so far, the communication between the HR bureau and USU civil servants can be resolved," said Thomas.
