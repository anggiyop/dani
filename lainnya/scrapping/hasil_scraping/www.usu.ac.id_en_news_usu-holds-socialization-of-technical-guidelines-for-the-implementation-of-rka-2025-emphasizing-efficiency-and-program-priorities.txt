“Efficiency must be the main mindset in program planning and implementation. We must be more selective in determining activities, so that only truly useful programs get funding,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Socialization of Technical Guidelines for implementing the Work Plan and Budget (RKA) Year 2025. This activity was attended by university leaders, faculties, and work units within USU to understand the latest guidelines in budget implementation. The socialization took place via Zoom Meeting on Wednesday (12/02/2025).

 

This socialization ensures that each work unit understands the applicable rules and can carry out the planned program effectively and efficiently. USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., emphasized that managing university finances must ensure that every activity improves the quality of education, research, and community service.

 

“Efficiency must be the main mindset in program planning and implementation. We must be more selective in determining activities, so that only truly useful programs get funding,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

With this socialization, the USU Rector hopes to increase effectiveness and efficiency in program implementation and ensure that every budget used truly supports USU's progress. He also invited all work units to work together to implement the policies that have been set and ensure that every decision is based on the university's best interests.

 

“We must ensure that this policy is carried out with full commitment so that USU is increasingly developing and able to compete at the national and international levels,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

In the technical presentation, Dr. Wahyu Ario Pratomo, S.E., M.Ec., the main speaker, said that the RKA implementation mechanism includes planning, monitoring, evaluation, and budget changes. He emphasized that each work unit must submit monthly progress reports. With this system, university leaders can more easily assess the effectiveness of each program implemented.

 

“Therefore, each work unit must be committed to submitting reports on time and complying with established administrative procedures,” explained Dr. Wahyu.

 

In addition, this socialization also conveyed that changes to the activity schedule can only be made in the same quarter or according to a predetermined period. This policy is implemented to maintain the stability of budget planning so that expenditures remain controlled. The evaluation team will strictly monitor to ensure that each work unit runs the program according to the initial plan.

 

“We don't want any activities to suddenly change without a clear reason because that will disrupt the stability of university budget planning,” he added.

 

In the discussion session, several participants revealed the obstacles faced in implementing the RKA, such as bureaucracy in budget changes and flexibility in managing dynamic activities. Dr. Wahyu emphasized that the university will continue to evaluate policies to ensure the budget planning and implementation system runs more effectively.

 

“Every budget change must go through a clear procedure so that there is no overlap in the university's financial management,” said Dr. Wahyu.
