Meutia Nauly said, "So, yes, this is something we need for the implementation of the tri dharma, which is the responsibility of higher education. We need safe, comfortable places where sexual violence doesn't happen."

USU PR: Universitas Sumatera Utara's Task Force for the Prevention and Handling of Sexual Violence (PPKS) held counseling sessions in all faculties and graduate schools. On Wednesday, August 2, 2023, socialization occurs at the USU Faculty of Engineering.

Since last year, USU has had a PPKS Task Force team. The fact that the PPKS Task Force was made is a sign of support for the Permendikbud on campus. Meutia Nauly, S.Psi., M.Si., Psychologist, Chairman of the USU PPKS Task Force, stated that forming the PPKS Task Force is crucial to implementing the tri dharma of higher education. Hence, the participation of the academic community is required to provide safe and free spaces from sexual violence.

Meutia Nauly said, "So, yes, this is something we need for the implementation of the tri dharma, which is the responsibility of higher education. We need safe, comfortable places where sexual violence doesn't happen."

The PPKS Task Force's job doesn't end with socializing. Instead, they will set up a service for students and staff who want to talk about sexual harassment problems and then help those who have been harassed.

"So we'll do that. I've also asked my psychology friends for help, and my student friends on the task force are ready to hear all of your complaints, and we'll do our best," she said.

Since its inception, the USU PPKS Task Force has had an online complaint facility.

Meutia Nauly, S.Psi., M.si., a psychologist, hopes that there won't be any cases of sexual violence at USU. In addition, she urged all academics and members of the community to collaborate in creating a secure and comfortable atmosphere for learning and activities.

"Thus, people from outside who can listen to USU TV are encouraged to join us, and together we will create a safe space for learning and activities," she stated.
