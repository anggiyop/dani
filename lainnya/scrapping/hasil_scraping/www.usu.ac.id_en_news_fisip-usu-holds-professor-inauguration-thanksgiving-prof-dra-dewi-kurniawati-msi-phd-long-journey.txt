“This will accelerate the achievement of USU's target to enter the Top 500 World Class University. Hopefully, the knowledge gained can be practiced and benefit society,” said Dr. Hatta Ridho.

Public Relations USU - The Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Thanksgiving event on Monday (10/02/2025) at the FISIP USU Hall to celebrate the inauguration of the Professor of Communication Science, Prof. Dra. Dewi Kurniawati, M.Si, Ph.D.

This Thanksgiving began with the tradition of upah-upah as a form of respect for the three newly inaugurated Professors of FISIP USU. In his speech, the Dean of FISIP USU, Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., MSP, expressed his appreciation for this achievement and hoped that in fostering our human resources, many more lecturers would follow to become Professors.

“This will accelerate the achievement of USU's target to enter the Top 500 World Class University. Hopefully, the knowledge gained can be practiced and benefit society,” said Dr. Hatta Ridho.

The Head of the Master of Communication Studies Program, Prof. Dr. Iskandar Zulkarnain, M.Si, also expressed his pride in this achievement. He said the journey to Professor was full of challenges, especially because Prof. Dra. Dewi Kurniawati, M.Si, Ph.D is also active as a BAN-PT assessor.

“Prof. Dewi's struggle is extraordinary; with a busy schedule, she can still reach the peak of this academic career,” said Prof. Iskandar Zulkarnain.

Prof. Dra. Dewi Kurniawati, M.Si, Ph.D., revealed that her research focuses on digital marketing communication, especially optimizing the potential of tourist villages in Indonesia. She explained that an effective marketing communication model can increase an area's tourist attractiveness and positively impact the local community's economy.

“If this potential is maximally explored, it will positively impact the welfare of the community,” explained Prof. Dewi.

Prof. Dra. Dewi Kurniawati, M.Si, Ph.D also highlighted the various challenges faced in research, from finding the right sources to dealing with bureaucracy in data collection. However, she emphasized that perseverance and enthusiasm can overcome all these obstacles.

Prof. Dra. Dewi Kurniawati, M.Si, Ph.D., encouraged young academics to continue doing research and pursue the pinnacle of their academic careers as Professors. She emphasized that this achievement is not only about personal achievement but also about contributing to the development of science.

“Becoming a Professor is part of an academic achievement that shows that we are capable and can benefit many people,” she concluded.
