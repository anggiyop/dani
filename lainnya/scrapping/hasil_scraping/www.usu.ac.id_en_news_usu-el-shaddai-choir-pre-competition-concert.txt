I am thrilled, very proud this evening, on behalf of my alumni, congratulating the El-Shaddai USU Choir, which is ready to enter the Tokyo-Osaka international competition," she said

USU PR - The El-Shaddai Choir of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Pre-Competition Concert II at Magnificent Hall, Podomoro City Deli Medan, on Saturday (08/07/2023).

El-Shaddai USU Choir Chairman, Elizabeth Sihite, explained that this event was held as a form of preparation as well as training for the El-Shaddai USU Choir team before participating in the 38th Takarazuka International Chamber Chorus Contest and the 5th Tokyo International Choir Competition which will take place in Japan. In addition, this event also aims to raise additional accommodation funds.

"So El-Shaddai wants to compete in Japan. This is one form of training too. And secondly, this concert is also held as a form of our fundraising, through ticket purchases and donation collection," she explained.

Elizabeth Sihite added that by organizing this event, people could get to know the activeness of USU students in the non-academic field.

"Hopefully El-Shaddai will exist more in the future, and more people will know that we USU students are still active, besides being active in college but still active in organizations," she said.

El-Shaddai USU Choir Alumni, Ir. Marolop Nainggolan, MA, is also happy and proud of the team competing in the international arena and hopes that this pre-competition event can hone them in the championship later.

"I am thrilled, very proud this evening. On behalf of the alumni, I would like to congratulate the El-Shaddai USU Choir, which is ready to enter the Tokyo-Osaka international competition," she said.

Representing the parents of El-Shaddai USU Choir members, Jamelius Purba also expressed his hope that the team that will compete will remain enthusiastic in their work and be ready to face any challenges.

"Our hope, parents, is for children to keep working whatever the challenges and obstacles are, keep working to become the nation's children," he said.
