The entries spanned the categories of Owned Media, Digital Channel, Crisis Management, Annual Report, PR Program, PR Department, CSR Program, and PR Department.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) earned three awards at the Public Relations Indonesia Awards (PRIA) on Friday (17/03/2023) in Denpasar, Bali. The previous year, USU only won two awards.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), stated that the awards won should continue to inspire public relations activities inside the university.

Prof. Muryanto Amin stated, "Perhaps in the future, it will continue to progress and surpass the previous year's performance."

The Rector noted that rewards from external parties are a bonus for the completed effort but that all parties must be able to contribute optimally to the launched projects.

"We still have a lot of work to do, and we need a strong team to continue being the greatest," he stated.

Head of Public Relations, Promotion, and Protocol, Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., Psychologist, highlighted that in 2023, USU received the Bronze Winning award in the Print Media category (Mata USU), the Silver Winner award for Video Profile, and the Most Popular in Mass Media award.

"The 8th PRIA competition is becoming more competitive as the number of entries increases and participants become more diversified," he remarked.

This momentum also incentivizes the public relations team to continue improving the campus's image in the global community.

For your information, PRIA 2023 was attended by 235 agencies with 837 entries spanning categories such as Owned Media, Digital Channel, Crisis Management, Annual Report, PR Program, PR Department, CSR Program, and PR Department.
