“I would like to congratulate the students who competed in the 37th PIMNAS. This is a proud achievement, and we hope to achieve better results than the previous year,” said Vice Rector I USU.

USU PR - Students of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) won medals in the 37th National Student Art Week (PIMNAS) held at Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR). The medal in this prestigious national competition is a positive step for USU to compete at the national level.

The first gold medal was won by a team from the USU PKM RE-6 category with the title “Combination of Andaliman Extract and Purple Passionfruit Peel as an Acrylic Resin Denture Cleaning Paste.” The team, consisting of a collaboration of students from the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy, and FMIPA, was mentored by drg. Veronica Angela, MDSc, Sp. Not only succeeded in bringing the gold medal, the team also won the Favorite Award in the PKM RE-6 presentation category.

Another team that also managed to gain gold in this event was the PKM-KC Team from the USU IT Fasilkom. The group led by Tessa Agitha Irwani Br Barus brought the title “ElCue: Video Call Application with Indonesian Sign Language Detection (BISINDO) Based on Computer Vision and Deep Learning to Improve Inclusive Communication.” The creativity of the work and research of Tessa and her friends awarded USU with a gold medal from the PKM-KC Poster Category.

Meanwhile, the PKM Team from the Faculty of Engineering also awarded USU with a Bronze Medal for the Poster Category of the Constructive Video Ideas Scheme (VGK). This award was successfully obtained by Jasmine Meilani Halim (FT) and her team members under the guidance of Ir. Tania Alda, S.T., M.T., after presenting a work entitled Ulos Heritage: Interactive Museum based on Mixed Reality as an Effort to Introduce and Maintain Ulos as Batak Cultural Wisdom Towards World Heritage.

The bronze medal was also successfully obtained in the Poster Category of PKM RE-2 class. The team was led by Derrick Tan (FMIPA) and mentored by Dr. Ir. Zikri Noer S.Si., M.Si. Derrick's team won the 3rd best place in this category after presenting a work entitled, KitoGraph Filter: Innovation of rGO/Nanokitosan integrated water filter using Palm Oil Empty Fruit Bunch as a Clean Water Solution and Proper Sanitation.

Also this year, one of USU's students, Monica Septyarny Zega (Faculty of Psychology), received an individual award as a PKM RSH-2 Talented Student. Previously, Monica and her team presented a work entitled “Healing Prison Program: Intervensi Penurunan Stres Anak Binaan Pemasyarakatan Melalui Terapi Berbasis Hortikultura untuk Mewujudkan Kesejahteraan Psiklogis di Lembaga Pembinaan.”

That is a series of brilliant achievements made by the USU delegation at the 37th PKM. A number of these awards are certainly good news for the USU academic community. Responding to this, USU Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., expressed his pride for all USU delegates who have competed in this prestigious annual event.

“I would like to congratulate the students who competed in the 37th PIMNAS event. This is a proud achievement, and we hope to achieve better results than the previous year,” he said.

In line with this, the Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations (Ditmawalumni USU), Rahma Yurliani S.Psi., M.Psi revealed that the success of USU students at this year's PIMNAS is proof of the hard work and dedication of USU students to achieve prestigious achievements at the National level.

According to him, this success explains the spirit of collaboration and support involving USU, Ditmawalumni, PKM Center, PKM Corner, and lecturers accompanying student PKM groups.

“Once again, as Director of Ditmawalumni, I congratulate USU students for their success and for bringing USU's name to the 12th National rank at the 23rd PIMNAS event at Airlangga University,” he concluded proudly.
