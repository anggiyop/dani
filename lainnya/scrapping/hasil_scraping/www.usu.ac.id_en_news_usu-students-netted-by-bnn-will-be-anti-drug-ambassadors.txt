"USU students are good at playing music. It is a capital to empower them so they can avoid drug abuse," he said.

Brigadier General Toga also explained that their current option is to be rehabilitated.

"Because we see they have potential, where they are good at playing music. Later we hope they can become anti-drug ambassadors. Not only for the USU Campus, but for the whole community," said Toga.

In addition, the Rector of USU instructed to provide intense assistance to students. Students are also not allowed to stay overnight. Even if you have to stay overnight, you must have written permission and the knowledge of the campus.
