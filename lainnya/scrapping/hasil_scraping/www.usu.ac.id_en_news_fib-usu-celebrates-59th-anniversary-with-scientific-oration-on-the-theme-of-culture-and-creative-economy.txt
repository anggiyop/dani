“Hopefully, the Faculty of Cultural Sciences will continue to advance and have a significant impact on increasing appreciation and preservation of Indonesian culture,” said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) celebrated its 59th Anniversary by holding a scientific oration entitled “Cultural Resilience as the Foundation for Sustainable Creative Economy Development.” The activity took place on the FIB USU campus on Wednesday (06/11/2024).

 

In the scientific oration, Prof. Dr. Agus Mulyana, M.Hum, the Dean of the Faculty of Social Science Education (FPIPS), University of Education Indonesia (UPI), was present as a speaker. Prof. Dr. Agus Mulyana, M.Hum, discussed the role of cultural resilience in building a sustainable creative economy.

 

The Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., appreciated the contribution of FIB USU in enriching the world of education and in maintaining and preserving national culture. The USU Rector also emphasized the importance of culture as the wealth of the nation, especially in the midst of globalization which increasingly threatens traditional values.

 

“Hopefully, the Faculty of Cultural Sciences will continue to advance and have a significant impact on increasing appreciation and preservation of Indonesian culture,” he said.

 

The theme of this anniversary, “Culture as an Asset of the Nation's Wealth,” is considered very relevant to modern challenges where the influence of foreign cultures often erodes local traditions. The USU Rector emphasized that to preserve culture, cooperation between academics, government, the private sector, and all elements of society is needed.

 

“Culture is not only a historical heritage but also an asset to strengthen unity and become Indonesia's soft power both at home and abroad,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

In supporting internationalization, the Faculty of Cultural Sciences has collaborated with various international institutions, including Universitas Kebangsaan Malaysia and Universitas Brunei Darussalam. Dean of FIB USU, Prof. Dr. Dra. T. Thyrhaya Zein, M.A., mentioned that their international programs, namely credit transfer, summer courses, and student exchanges, have been successfully implemented.

 

“The age of 59 years has given FIB a mature time to continue to innovate in education, research, and community service,” she said.

 

This anniversary has been going on since August with various activities involving all elements of the faculty, such as folk game competitions to foster a love of culture. The Chairman of the Anniversary Committee, Dr. Rahmadsyah Rangkuti, S.S., M.A., Ph.D., hopes that the theme of this year's anniversary can be an encouragement for all academicians in carrying out the tridharma function of education and serving the community.

 

“Building a new civilization requires quality education and cultural understanding and preservation,” said Rahmadsyah.
