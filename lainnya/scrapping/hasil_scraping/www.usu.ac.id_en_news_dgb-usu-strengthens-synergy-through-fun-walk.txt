“Events like this strengthen friendship as well as provide space to discuss important things that are sometimes difficult for us to talk about because of limited time on campus,” said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Council of Professors (DGB) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), also enlivened the USU Anniversary by holding a Fun Walk. The activity took place at the Faculty of Forestry USU Kwala Bekala, on Saturday, (07/12/2024).

In his remarks, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., expressed his gratitude to the entire board of professors for their participation in enlivening the fun walk activities. He highlighted the fun walk activity as a means of strengthening friendship while discussing various important issues in a relaxed and informal manner.

“Events like this strengthen friendship while providing space to discuss important matters that are sometimes difficult for us to discuss due to limited time on campus,” said the USU Rector.

Apart from being a place to strengthen the relationship between DGB members, it also aims to strengthen synergy in achieving the main performance targets (IKU) set by USU. The Fun Walk, which was attended by more than 130 members of the Council of Professors (DGB) and their families, succeeded in exceeding the initial target which was previously estimated to only reach 100 participants.

“We are very grateful for the enthusiasm that exceeds expectations. This is an extraordinary achievement, and we thank the entire committee who have worked hard,” said Prof. Agus.

Prof. Dr. Agus Purwoko, S.Hut., M.Si., as chairman of the committee, also delivered a number of important achievements. Among them are the appointment of three new professors, plus one candidate who is currently in the finalization stage. In addition, in the next three years, the campus has prepared 10 professorship candidates to be submitted, so as to increase the proportion of professors who have currently reached 25% of the total staff, exceeding the national target of 20%.

In addition to discussion activities, the fun walk was enlivened with various entertainments, such as karaoke competitions, fishing and various local culinary specialties of Medan, including durian, lontong and lemang typical of Tuntungan.

“This fun walk is an activity to end the year, other activities of the professors are already running. Hopefully with this event, our friendship will get closer,” said Prof. Rosmayati.
