"This activity is held to fill an important need that supports the acceleration of development, which must have the main ability to face the demands of the world of work for the availability of high-quality human resources and high technology skills," explained VR I.

PR USU - The Information Technology Study Program, University of North Sumatra (USU) held an Information Technology (IT) Festival (Fest) USU 6.0 with the theme "Pandemic Recovery with Technology". This activity was held online on Sunday (24/04/2022).

IT FEST, which has been held since 2017 is an event for students who have high interest and innovation in information technology by holding various branches of competitions in the field of information technology.

In his remarks, USU Vice-Rector I for Academic, Student, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH. MA. said IT FEST 2022 will hold several events such as seminars, talk shows, and several information technology-based creativity competitions such as UI design, UX design and competitive programming.

"This activity is held to fill important needs that support the acceleration of development, which must have the main ability to face the demands of the world of work for the availability of high-quality human resources and high technology skills," he explained.

VR I appreciated this positive activity to increase the ideas and creativity of information technology students. But, according to him, this activity is very much needed in the current era of disruption.

In line with this, Head of the Information Technology Study Program Sara Purnawati, ST., M.Sc hopes that this activity will fulfill its initial goal to become a forum for Indonesian students to develop talents in creating new innovations that can help Indonesia rise from the pandemic.

"Hopefully, the ideas that have been outlined in the various branches of the competition will be able to bring us up from the pandemic era according to the theme of this event," he said.
