USU PR - Mapala UI and KOMPAS USU held a collaboration activity for local children titled Kembara Banoa Toba (KBT) in October-November 2021. Packaged in the form of natural exploration and cultural studies, this activity is a real contribution in commemorating this year's Youth Pledge.

KBT activities are located in the Lake Toba area which is one of the super priority tourist destinations. The historical value and natural beauty of Lake Toba has attracted many tourists both from within the country and abroad. Through this activity, tourism potential, both in terms of natural beauty and the culture of the surrounding community, will be explored more deeply.

The participants carried out a flag ceremony to commemorate the moment of the "Youth Pledge". They stretched the red and white flag formation using kayaks on Sibandang Island. This activity became a symbolic form of offerings by the sons and daughters of the country to enliven the spirit of unity and celebrate diversity. In addition, they also do rock climbing, exploration of the horizon using paragliding, and cultural studies.

The Chief Executive of KBT, Alfan Alfarizzi, said that the preparation and simulation of each KBT activity had been carried out since July. “Towards the five days of implementation, everything related to the preparation of activities has been carried out, including simulations of each activity. So far, inter-organizational coordination can be well established through regular online meetings,” said Afan.

The output of this activity will result in a study of cultural village recommendations and recommendations for integrated special interest tourism in accordance with the direction of the super priority tourist destination development instrument, namely the Integrated Tourism Master Plan. This was conveyed by the General Secretary of KBT Maharani Putri.

"The results of these activities are expected to help supporting agencies and the surrounding community to develop tourist destinations and realize Lake Toba as a sustainable world-scale tourism area," said Maharani. (©ULC)
