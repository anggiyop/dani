Zola Sandra Siregar, S.H., M.H., has demonstrated her resilience, perseverance, and courage in manifesting her ideals by earning the Master's Degree from the Master's Program in Law, Faculty of Law, USU. Zola has accomplished one of his objectives: to make her mother happy.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held its third graduation period on April 3 and 4, 2023, leaving graduates and their extended families with various memories of joy. One of the most memorable was for the family of Zola Sandra Siregar, S.H, M.H., a Master's Program in Law Graduate. Hj. Ina Zahrina, Zola's mother, represented her during the graduation process.

At the time, Ina's mother went up the stage to receive the degree from the Rector of USU, Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si. The emotional moment drew thunderous applause in honor of the late Zola Sandra Siregar, S.H., M.H., who could not attend the graduation ceremony.

Zola Sandra Siregar, S.H, M., H., is described as jolly, outgoing, and cheerful. The passing of the woman born on March 31, 1990, has left family and friends in deep sorrow. Although her passing away on January 30 caused sadness and loss, her accomplishments and fond memories of her will live on. Mrs. Hj Ina Zahrina's attendance at Zola's graduation ceremony was a fitting tribute to the woman who had earned a Master's degree, was cheerful, and was well-liked by her family and friends.

One of three siblings, the youngest, is very close to her mother. Zola's mother claimed that Zola was always with her wherever she went. Zola passed away when he was 32 years old. She left a positive impression during her lifetime. Her friends and those around her confirm this. Zola, who loved to sing, used to be a member of a musical group called "Alat Dapur" at his old school, TK Harapan. This is one of Zola's many fond memories. Zola's cheerful disposition remained until the final moments of her passing.

Although Zola was not physically present at the graduation ceremony, her mother's presence as a representative honored her daughter's accomplishments and hard work throughout her college career. This accomplishment was hers, made possible by the encouragement and support of those around her.

Zola Sandra Siregar, S.H., M.H. has demonstrated her resilience, perseverance, and courage in manifesting her ideals by earning the Master's Degree from the Master's Program in Law, Faculty of Law, USU. Zola has accomplished one of his objectives: to make her mother happy."
