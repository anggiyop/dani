"Hopefully, the collaboration between USU and Polmed must continue to work together to move forward together," he said.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si attended the Gathering with the Academic Civitas of the Medan State Polytechnic as well as the submission of the Decree of the Board of Trustees of the Medan State Polytechnic. The event was held at the Z Polmed Building on Thursday (02/06/2022).

In his remarks, the Rector of USU said that USU continued to support all development and progress efforts in Polmed. He explained that in 1979, USU was designated as one of 6 Universities/Institutes that received a Phase I Polytechnic Education development project from DIKTI, under the name Polytechnic University of North Sumatra (USU Polytechnic) Medan. However, in 1986 the USU Polytechnic officially separated from USU and became an Independent Polytechnic and changed its name to Medan State Polytechnic (Polmed).

"I would like to thank the Director of the Medan State Polytechnic and the entire academic community of the Med State Polytechnic, who has allowed us to become a member of the Board of Trustees," he said.

The Rector also stated that the purpose of this event was to focus on developing the practical and technical capabilities of human resources in the vocational pathway to improve the quality, quantity, and expansion of the field of cooperation.

"Hopefully, the collaboration between USU and Polmed must continue to work together so that they can move forward together," he said.

On the same occasion the Director of Polmed Abdul Rahman, S.E., Ak., M.Si hoped that Polmed could stand alone and manage finances independently under the auspices of the Public Service Agency (BLU) with the help of USU and the Medan city government.

"I hope Polmed can have adequate facilities like USU to educate the nation's children better," he said.

The Mayor of Medan Bobby Nasution, said that this activity was one of the collaborative activities aimed at making Polmed learn about BLU and run independently without being tied to state money. This collaboration is expected to benefit both parties, namely USU and Polmed, to develop together

.

"Hopefully this activity can educate the nation's children and get a reward for us," he concluded.
