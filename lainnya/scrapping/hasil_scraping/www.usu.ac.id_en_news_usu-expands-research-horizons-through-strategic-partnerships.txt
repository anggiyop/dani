This joint research and scientific publication development effort aims to enhance USU's reputation in the global research arena and increase the number of faculty publications, particularly those based on international collaboration.

FAHUT-PR: To develop the university's flagship collaborative research program and expand its global research network through Scientific Clusters, a joint research team comprising faculty members from the Faculty of Forestry, along with faculty and doctoral students from the Doctoral Program in Natural Resource and Environmental Management at the Graduate School of USU, conducted a series of activities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

These activities included participation from Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Shah Alam, Universiti Malaya (UM), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), and UiTM Puncak Alam. The series of activities involved Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) to discuss research development topics, discussion and signing of Memorandums of Agreement (MoA), participation in an International Conference, Internal Staff Mobility, and a Scientific Article Writing Workshop. This joint research and scientific publication development effort aims to enhance USU's reputation in the global research arena and increase the number of faculty publications, particularly those based on international collaboration.

Funded by the Equity Program and Talent Research of USU, the activities commenced with a discussion on the collaboration program at the University of Malaya Alumni Association Building on Sunday, April 28, 2024. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Ir. Secca Gandaseca, M.Sc., representing the host, warmly welcomed the USU team, which included Prof. Dr. Ir.
