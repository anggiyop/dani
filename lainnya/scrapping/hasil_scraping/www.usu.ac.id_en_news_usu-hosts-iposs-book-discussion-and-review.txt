“I hope this discussion can provide a new perspective and be able to contribute in formulating innovative and applicable solutions,” said the USU Rector.

USU PR - Indonesia Palm Oil Strategic Studies (IPOSS) held a book review and discussion on the sustainability of the palm oil industry. With the theme “Palm Oil Sustainability: Law, Environment and Agricultural Perspective,” the event took place at Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Sumatera Utara on Monday, (04/11/2024).

 

In his remarks, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.sos, M.Si, said that this discussion was very relevant to the challenges faced by the palm oil industry, not only regarding economic aspects but also environmental, legal, and social.

 

“I think this topic is very important and relevant to the real situation today,” said the Rector.

 

Along with the increasing demands for environmentally friendly and legally compliant palm oil production practices, the Rector hopes that the participants can produce guidelines that can become innovative solutions to maintain the sustainability of the Indonesian palm oil industry.

 

“I hope this discussion can provide a new perspective and be able to contribute to formulating innovative and applicable solutions,” said the Rector.

 

Indonesia's palm oil industry continues to make a significant contribution to the country's economy, with more than 18 million people depending on the sector. Although often attacked with negative campaigns, the majority of the palm oil industry plays a major role in creating jobs and supporting the national economy.

 

As an effort to straighten out various negative issues that have developed, IPOSS published a book entitled “Palm Oil, a Gift that Needs to be Fought for.” IPOSS General Secretary Muhammad Rumi Djalil explained that the making of the book began in mid-2023 by involving academics and legal experts. “There is a legal perspective, there is an economic perspective, an agricultural perspective, like that,” explained Rumi. On the same occasion, Muhammad Rumi conveyed the reason for choosing USU as the location for the discussion and book, which was that North Sumatra was the first place where oil palm was commercially planted in Indonesia in 1911. In addition, many people in North Sumatra depend on the palm oil industry.

 

“So USU in North Sumatra is where palm oil was first commercially planted in Indonesia,” Rumi explained.

 

The event ended with the hope that the strategic steps produced could have a positive impact on Indonesia's economic progress and the welfare of the community.
