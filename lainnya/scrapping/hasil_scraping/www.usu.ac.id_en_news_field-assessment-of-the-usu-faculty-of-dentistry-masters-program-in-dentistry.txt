USU PR - The Independent Accreditation Agency for Health Higher Education (LAM-PTKes) conducted a Field Assessment of the Master's Program in Dentistry at the Faculty of Dentistry, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). The field assessment involved two teams of assessors, namely Prof. Dr. Eha Renwi Astuti, drg, M.Kes, Sp.RKG(K) from Universitas Airlangga and Dr. drg. Mochammad Taha Ma'ruf, M.Erg, CMC., from Universitas Mahasaraswati. The activity was held in the Nazir Alwi Room, Faculty of Dentistry, on Tuesday (Feb. 2)

The Dean, Dr. Essie Octiara, drg., Sp.KGA. said that for the 2024 target, the Faculty of Dentistry will continue to improve its performance. Regarding the WCU target, the Faculty of Dentistry has already achieved targets such as holding Guest Lectures and inviting practitioners to teach.

"For example, the WCU target includes inviting practitioners to teach, and we have already done that. We have also had guest lectures from abroad," she said.

The Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry also added that by conducting this field assessment, the assessor team can provide input to improve the quality and performance of the program and maintain its superior accreditation.

"Of course, it captures the progress of the Study Program over the past five years. Hopefully, it is in accordance with the forms and performance targets," she added.

The assessor team, Prof. Dr. Eha Renwi Astuti, drg, M.Kes, Sp.RKG(K)., said that the Master's Program in Dentistry must improve its quality and be in accordance with the Tri Dharma of Higher Education. The work units must always collaborate to achieve the goals and targets effectively.

"We must improve education, research, and community service. And all of these will eventually become a unit and not be separated, as in the Tri Dharma of Higher Education," she said.
