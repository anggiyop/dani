“Foreign students who are accepted will first learn Indonesian for one year at the USU Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) before continuing their studies in the intended study program,” said Prof. Rudy.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an audience on Wednesday (25/09/2024) to discuss the international student exchange program. The event, which was attended by the Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) and Developing Country Partnership (KNB) students, took place in the USU Rector's Audience Room.

 

The Head of the USU Office of International Affairs (KUI), Prof. Dr. Rudy Sofyan, S.S., M.Hum., explained that USU will receive six foreign students from developing countries for exchange study programs, including 1 person in the Doctoral program, 3 people in the Master's program and 2 people in the Undergraduate program. Conversely, 18 IISMA students from USU will be sent to various universities abroad.

 

The selection process of foreign students who will come to USU is carried out strictly. Study programs with superior accreditation are the top priority. After that, prospective students will go through the registration process, be assessed by the Indonesian embassy in their home country, do online interviews, and get approval from the USU institutional directorate. Prof. Rudy also explained that foreign students who are accepted will first learn Indonesian for one year at the USU Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) before continuing their studies in the intended study program.

 

“Foreign students who are accepted will first learn Indonesian for one year at the USU Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) before continuing their studies in the intended study program,” said Prof. Rudy.

 

Meanwhile, the Dean of FIB USU, Prof. Dr. Dra. T. Thyrhaya Zein, M.A., welcomed the presence of international students at FIB. According to him, the intensive Indonesian language learning program for two semesters will help international students reach the B2 level of proficiency. In addition, international students will also be invited to interact with local students, learn cultural dances, and practice Indonesian in schools in Medan.

 

The IISMA program followed by USU students was also highlighted in the hearing. Prof. Rudy hopes that the IISMA participants can be good ambassadors for USU and Indonesia in the destination country. He said that his office will continue to monitor the development of IISMA students while they are abroad. With this student exchange program, USU further strengthens international networks and provides opportunities for students to learn, exchange cultures, and increase the number of foreign students who want to study at USU.

 

“We will continue to monitor the development of IISMA students while they are abroad,” said the Dean of FIB USU.
