"The collaboration between USU and Pertamina has been realized today. We hope for more partnerships in the future, such as having practitioners teach on campus and providing USU students with internship opportunities at Pertamina," stated Prof. Poppy.

USU PR—PT Pertamina (Persero) once again held the "Pertamina Goes to Campus" event at the Universitas Sumatera Utara(USU), themed "Energizing The Future Together." The event occurred in the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall, Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) USU, on Tuesday (May 21, 2024).

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., who serves as Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation at USU, hopes that this collaboration can be a significant initial step towards more extensive cooperation opportunities between USU and Pertamina in the future.

"The collaboration between USU and Pertamina has been realized today. We hope for more partnerships in the future, such as having practitioners teach on campus and providing USU students with internship opportunities at Pertamina," stated Prof. Poppy.

Julfi Hadi, the President and Director of PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk expressed that Pertamina aims to inspire and open doors for USU students to participate in shaping a sustainable energy future. He highlighted the increasing urgency of climate change and Indonesia's crucial role in achieving the net zero emission target by 2050.

"Now is the era of energy transition, and we all must realize that climate change is real, and Indonesia must genuinely push for net zero emissions by 2050. Pertamina will undoubtedly contribute," explained Julfi.

Julfi Hadi also outlined their views on career opportunities and development programs offered by Pertamina to students. He emphasized the various disciplines Pertamina seeks, ranging from technical fields such as geochemistry, geology, and geophysics to other disciplines like civil engineering, accounting, law, and chemistry.

Julfi Hadi stated that this event is just an introduction, and Pertamina hopes students will think more deeply about climate change and green energy transition after the event concludes.

"There may be more seminars in the future; this is just an introduction. Energy transition is important, and climate change is important. I hope that USU will start considering transitioning to green energy," said Julfi.

In this context, Eka Permana Sidik, S.Sos., M.M., Vice President of Human Capital at PT Pertamina Power Indonesia, provided an in-depth explanation regarding the selection of USU as the event location. He explained that USU is a pioneer in North Sumatra, and Pertamina's presence in the region opens up broader collaboration opportunities with USU.

"Moreover, PGE also has a working area in North Sumatra, specifically in Sibayak, which is why we chose USU," said Eka.
