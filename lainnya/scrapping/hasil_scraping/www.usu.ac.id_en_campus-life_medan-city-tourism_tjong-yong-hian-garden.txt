Not to be missed, the graves of Tjong Yong Hian and his wife are located within the garden. This proximity provides an emotionally moving personal touch for visitors. Not only that, but the inscriptions within the park are also eye-catching, with Arabic, Dutch, and Chinese inscriptions recounting Tjong Yong Hian's life journey and achievements.
