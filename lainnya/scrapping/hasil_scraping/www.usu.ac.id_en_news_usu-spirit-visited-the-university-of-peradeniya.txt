Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) participated together in realizing the final goal of this project, namely increasing awareness of young people to be able to prevent infectious diseases such as obesity, hypertension, chronic heart disease, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and other diseases through increased physical activity and proper nutrition. Universitas Sumatera Utara has developed it through seminars, workshops, summer courses, counseling, and conferences. Apart from that, there are also other collaborative collaborative activities, namely guest lectures or international guest lectures, adjunct professor activities, and student visits abroad. This was also expressed by Prof. Dr. Dr. Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked (OG), SpOG, Subsp. F. E. R., as legal representative and Secretary of USU.

 

USU's SPIRIT Coordinator is Prof. Dr. Dina Keumala Sari, M. Gizi, SpGK(K) stated that many achievements had been made during this project, involving USU students and also a collaboration with other universities, especially the development of the SPIRIT Club. The SPIRIT Club form was developed with a worldwide name, namely the Global SPIRIT Club Network (GSCN), which invites all young people throughout the world to prevent infectious diseases together by increasing physical activity and proper nutrition. One of the students who participated and played an active role was Ferdian Mei Sandra from the USU Faculty of Medicine, stating his commitment to developing the GSCN.

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., expressed his support for this project and its development in the form of a SPORT SCIENCES Center, which will be built at USU. This development is a manifestation of USU's support for the SPIRIT project, apart from that the USU SPIRIT Club Fitness and Gym Center has been running well with members from outside and inside USU. It is hoped that this will manifest the commitment to prevent infectious diseases at both the North Sumatra and Indonesian national levels.
