“We thank all the participants who have come and celebrated this anniversary. Hopefully, after participating in this Fun Run, everyone will remain healthy and fit to continue tomorrow's activities,” said Prof. Muryanto.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the annual USU RUN 2024 in celebration of its 72nd Anniversary with the theme “Celebrating 72 Years of Excellence”. This activity was officially opened by the USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. It took place at the USU Auditorium, on Sunday (08/12/2024).

The event was also attended by the Acting Governor of North Sumatra, Agus Fatoni. USU RUN 2024 has two race categories offered, namely Family Fun RUN 1.5 km and Obstacle Fun RUN 5 km, which can be followed by participants of various ages ranging from 7 to 79 years. In addition to the running competition, USU RUN also presents a bazaar of local Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) offering a variety of interesting products.

In his opening remarks, the USU Rector expressed his gratitude to all participants who had enlivened this event. He hopes USU RUN will not only be a sporting event but also a moment to maintain health and fitness.

“We thank all the participants who have come and celebrated this anniversary. Hopefully, after participating in this Fun Run, everyone will stay healthy and fit to continue tomorrow's activities,” said Prof. Muryanto.

Chairman of the Anniversary Committee, Dr. dr. Muara Panusunan Lubis, M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K), explained that USU RUN is in line with USU's vision to strengthen the higher education ecosystem. This activity is designed to establish intimacy between the academic community and the general public, as well as a place to strengthen cross-generational relationships.

“This activity not only strengthens friendship but also supports the higher education ecosystem in achieving the vision of a Golden Indonesia 2045,” he said.

In addition, Dr. Muara highlighted the high enthusiasm of participants who came not only from the USU environment but also from the general public. He hopes that similar activities can continue to be held in the future to further strengthen the relationship between community members.

“We hope that in the future, Anniversary activities like this can be more lively and establish intimacy between people,” he hoped.

In a further interview, Dr. Muara also revealed that USU RUN 2024 is not the end of the anniversary series. There is still a peak event on December 12, 2024 in the form of an Award Day, where awards will be given to outstanding faculty, lecturers, and students. The event will end with an evening of entertainment featuring national artists.

With this activity, USU confirms its commitment to continue to encourage innovation and togetherness, as well as being an important part in realizing the vision of a Golden Indonesia 2045.
