USU PUBLIC RELATIONS – MEDAN: The Indonesian Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology (POGI) held an audience with the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., MSi.

Henry Salim Siregar Sp.OG (K)-FER along with the directors.

The hearing was held in the context of implementing the Declaration of Vaccines for Pregnant Women in North Sumatra, which is planned to be held on Wednesday, September 1, 2021. Around 70 pregnant women are planned to be vaccinated on the day of the declaration.

Prof. Fauzi explained that pregnant women are a group that is vulnerable to Covid-19. Previously, the handling of pregnant women during the pandemic was still in confusion because there were no regulations related to its management.With this declaration, it becomes a momentum for handling pregnant women during the Covid-19 pandemic.

“After recent research, we can finally vaccinate pregnant women.Previously, we were confused about how to handle pregnant women because they are a vulnerable group.However, after 19 August it was declared at the center, we will hold it here,” said Prof. Fauzi.

Welcoming this explanation, the Rector of USU expressed his appreciation by entrusting the USU Hospital as the point of vaccination for pregnant women.He said USU Hospital was ready and would make the event a success.

"We have prepared the necessary facilities.We ask the Director of USU Hospital to help prepare the things needed to make this vaccination a success.We will prepare health facilities, vaccinators, and also the rooms needed," said the USU Rector.

As is known, the government through the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia based on Circular No. HK.02.01/I/2007/2021 has given a vaccine permit for pregnant women.The letter became the basis for POGI Indonesia to provide recommendations for the implementation of vaccines for pregnant women in Indonesia.

Prof. Fauzi, stated that POGI North Sumatra was given a mandate by POGI Indonesia to immediately vaccinate pregnant women in North Sumatra.Therefore, POGI North Sumatra requires a location and complete medical services to fulfill this mandate.According to him, USU Hospital is considered the right vaccination point for pregnant women.

“After being recommended by POGI, we started looking for a suitable location with complete medical facilities.That's why we are here to communicate with the USU Rector so that we can carry out this vaccination at USU Hospital," Prof Fauzi said.(RR/©ULC)
