"This socialization is a form of collaboration between BRIN LPDP and USU, aimed at reaching out to students to continue their education to higher levels," added the Director of the Student Achievement and Alumni Relations Directorate at USU.

USU PR—Attended by students from four faculties at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), including the Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, and Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, the Socialization of the BRIN Talent Management Program and LPDP Doctoral Scholarship was successfully held in the FISIP USU Hall on Wednesday (Jun. 12, 2024)

"We are pleased to see USU students' interest in taking advantage of the valuable opportunity to explore great potential in the BRIN Talent Management Program and the LPDP Doctoral Scholarship," said the Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations at USU, Rahma Yurliani S.Psi., M.Psi., in her speech. A total of 250 USU students attended this socialization event.

The BRIN Talent Management Program is a concrete step in strengthening a reliable and competent human resource infrastructure in various strategic sectors. The LPDP Doctoral Scholarship not only provides talented individuals with access to pursue advanced studies but also offers financial support and leadership development, enabling recipients to make significant contributions to the nation's progress.

Rahma Yurliani S.Psi., M.Psi., hopes that through this socialization, participants, especially USU students, will gain a deeper understanding of these two programs and be motivated to actively seek and utilize the available opportunities.

"This socialization is a form of collaboration between BRIN LPDP and USU, aimed at reaching out to students to continue their education to higher levels," added the Director of the Student Achievement and Alumni Relations Directorate at USU.

As a speaker at the socialization event and a Cooperation Analyst at the National Research and Innovation Agency, Bakhtiardi Putra Siswinanda, S.Pd., stated that the BRIN LPDP Program targets four key fields in Indonesia for further exploration: Advanced University Utilization, Deep Sea Maritime, Radiation & Nuclear Technology, and Space & Aeronautics, to produce outstanding researchers in these fields.

The scholarship selection will start from June 19 to July 18, 2024, through the LPDP website, which can be accessed by students. The requirements specify that bachelor's degree graduates must be a maximum of 25 years old and master's degree graduates a maximum of 27 years old, with backgrounds in the four mentioned fields.

"The BRIN LPDP is expected to be utilized by USU students to produce skilled researchers. Currently, these four fields are needed, but it is possible that we will open up opportunities for other fields in the future," said Bakhtiar.
