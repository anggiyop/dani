"Every university has its own way of managing student affairs. Through this forum, there will be an exchange of information, sharing of experiences, and transfer of knowledge. These discussions can become valuable references for setting student-related policies," said the Rector.

USU PR– Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., officially opened the Vice Rectors’ Forum for Student Affairs from universities across Indonesia on Friday (October 29, 2021). The event, held in USU’s Auditorium as part of the 34th National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS), brought together vice rectors responsible for student affairs from universities nationwide.

In his opening remarks, the Rector emphasized that the forum served as a platform for communication and input regarding campus policy development. He noted that each university has its unique approach to managing student affairs.

"Every university has its own way of managing student affairs. Through this forum, there will be an exchange of information, sharing of experiences, and transfer of knowledge. These discussions can become valuable references for setting student-related policies," said the Rector.

He acknowledged that universities are currently facing numerous challenges, particularly in implementing the Merdeka Belajar-Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) program initiated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology.

"We are dealing with many challenges, especially in the implementation of the MBKM program. As expected in the early years, many obstacles arise. This forum allows us to discuss ways to accelerate the resolution of these challenges," he added. 

Dr. Muryanto highlighted the need to enhance and recalibrate collaboration among universities, aligning their perspectives and strategies. He advocated for the establishment of collaborative virtual educational spaces within the framework of Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi by leveraging the resources of each institution.

Addressing the role of practitioner-lecturers in the MBKM program, he stressed the importance of appropriate policies and management. Since these lecturers come from various professional backgrounds, they require a distinct approach.

"Practitioner-lecturers must be addressed wisely. Their role in the MBKM program is crucial in imparting practical knowledge to students. However, the practicalities of integrating them into academic settings need further discussion to develop clear guidelines," he explained.

The Rector further highlighted the impact of MBKM on PIMNAS, stating that the program enhances students’ knowledge, which they can channel into innovative ideas and solutions for PIMNAS competitions.

"Through MBKM, students gain a wealth of knowledge that enhances their innovation. This knowledge can be transformed into ideas and concepts to compete in PIMNAS," he concluded.
