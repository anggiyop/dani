Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, who directly received the award, appreciated the Press Workers Union (SPS) for recognizing the Universitas Sumatera Utara's public relations efforts. This honor is the result of consistent effort and diligence.

USU Public Relations was awarded the Bronze Winner for the Higher Education Internal Magazine Category (MATA USU Magazine) during the awarding night of the Press Company Union (SPS) Awards 2023 on Monday, March 20, 2023, in Jakarta.

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, who directly received the award, thanked the Press Workers Union (SPS) for recognizing the Universitas Sumatera Utara's public relations efforts. This honor is surely the result of hard work and persistence.

"Thus, it is anticipated that we will receive a better place in the upcoming award. With this external recognition, the team spirit must be even greater. Prof. Mury stated on Tuesday (03/21/2023) that appreciation must be used as a whip to continue implementing transformation.

Prof. Mury noted that the transformation process is ongoing, and the pace is being sped up; the goal is creating a world-class university. Therefore, each line must continue to exert maximum effort with quantifiable and attainable goals.

"Do not be satisfied with today's accomplishments. Prof. Mury explained that the transformation process must continue until the intended outcome is attained.

USU Head of Public Relations, Protocol, and Promotion Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., Psychologist, noted that the SPS Awards 2023 honor was an incentive to continue working after USU won three important awards at the Public Relations Indonesia Awards (PRIA) 2023.

"Thank you to the university administration, particularly the Rector, Professor Mury, for supporting the USU Public Relations work program to its fullest extent. Certainly also to media colleagues who have accompanied the USU Public Relations Team's trip to date, and maybe in the future, even greater accomplishments will be realized," she said.

According to its press release, the 14th Awards 2023 Press Company Union (SPS) aims to promote quality journalism in government, higher education, and private institutions. Elected Chairman of the Press Company Union for 2023-2027, Januar P. Ruswita, explained that the SPS Awards event, in which member press publishers also participated, emphasized the importance of presenting quality journalism works for media sustainability.

Carrying the theme "Collaboration and Innovation for the Independence of the Indonesian Press," the SPS Awards 2023 event highlights the spirit of press industry warriors in navigating the dynamics of the development of an uncertain era: the confidence to always collaborate and the enthusiasm to continue innovating.

The SPS Awards include five categories this year, including the Indonesia Print Media Awards (IPMA), Inhouse Magazine Awards (InMA), Indonesia Student Media Awards (ISPRIMA), Indonesia Young Readers Awards (IYRA), and Indonesia Digital Media Awards (IDMA).

The 2023 SPS Awards Judges consist of: Ahmad Djauhar (Senior Journalist), Pung Purwanto (News Director of MNC Koran Sindo), Oscar Motulloh (Curator and Independent Photojournalist), Danu Kusworo (Photo Editor of Kompas Daily), Mas Sulistyo (Creative Director of DM ID), Ika Sastrosoebroto (Founder and CEO of Prominent PR), and Jojo S Nugroho (Chairman of the Association of Indonesian Public Relations Companies (APPRI))
