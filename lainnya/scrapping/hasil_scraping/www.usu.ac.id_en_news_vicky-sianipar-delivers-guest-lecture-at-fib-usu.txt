These are the insights we hope the students will absorb. We invite practitioners to collaborate as a teaching team in practical teaching," stated Prof. Thirhaya.

USU PR- Renowned musician Vicky Sianipar served as the guest speaker in a guest lecture titled 'Introduction to the Music Industry and Musician Competency Standards,' held at the Multipurpose Room of the Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) on Thursday (27/10/2023).

Dean of FIB USU, Prof. Dr. T. Thirhaya Zein, M.A., expressed the significance of the guest lecture by the Study and Creation of Arts at FIB USU. Having a prominent musician who plays a role as a music entrepreneur and practitioner present at the event is considered a valuable opportunity and joy for the students.

"We feel very pleased and fortunate because a great musician who is now a music entrepreneur and practitioner is present among us this morning," said Prof. Thirhaya.

The Dean of FIB USU voiced full support for this guest lecture program, highlighting the importance of musicians who engage in teaching. This is a valuable opportunity for FIB, particularly the Study and Creation of Arts and Ethnomusicology Programs, to gain insights from music practitioners.

"These are the insights we hope the students will absorb. We invite practitioners to collaborate as a teaching team in practical teaching," stated Prof. Thirhaya.

Prof. Dr. Ikhwanuddin Nasution, M.Si., Head of the Postgraduate Program in Arts Creation and Study, hoped that this activity could be absorbed and become a source of inspiration in lectures, as well as contribute to the development of the music industry after students complete their studies.

"We have Bang Vicky Sianipar presenting about the music industry this morning. Hopefully, Bang Vicky's presentation can be absorbed to become part of the music industry," said Prof. Ikhwanuddin.

As the moderator, Prof. Drs. Mauly Purba, M.A., Ph.D. stated that the visit of Vicky Sianipar, a practitioner in the music industry, provided a valuable opportunity by sharing experiences as well as an understanding of competencies and competency measures that apply in the music industry market.

"So, this is a great opportunity because the music industry is a significant opportunity for FIB USU students," explained Prof. Mauly.

Vicky Sianipar hopes to create synergy between the academic and practitioner worlds. He hoped musicians graduating from academia, especially FIB USU students, could be ready to work in the music industry.

"I see that FIB USU graduates have great potential to enter the music industry. As long as we work hand in hand to achieve common goals," expressed Vicky.
