The Operational Development Program (PPO) is a collaborative program that will be carried out by USU and PT. BTN. USU's Rector in his remarks admitted that he was interested in this collaboration. He assessed that the adaptation of flexibility to the PPO would bring many benefits to both institutions, both USU and BTN.

"We hope this can provide benefits for each institution, both for USU and for BTN," Muryanto Amin said.

In his remarks, the Rector also mentioned BTN's collaboration with other universities, especially regarding asset management. According to him, USU and BTN need to discuss further technical issues regarding this matter.

"We have seen several BTN programs at other universities, which later we will discuss the technicalities, especially now that we are being directed to utilize assets and then have asked third parties to work together to manage assets, so this seems like what we need to talk about technically," the Rector said.

Regional Office Head PT. BTN, tbk M. Amin Soleh explained, the PPO is compensation for USU's financial management at BTN to build infrastructure to facilitate education at USU.

"This is a signing of the PPO collaboration, so this PPO Operational Development Program is compensation from USU's management and finances at BTN that we provide to build public infrastructure that supports education at USU," he explained.

M. Amin Soleh hopes that through this collaboration, USU's synergy with BTN will get stronger, so that they can advance the world of education in Indonesia.

"In the future USU will synergize even stronger and to advance the world of education in Indonesia. Hopefully USU will be more victorious, successful, and enter the World Class University," M. Amin Soleh said.

Apart from PPO, previously USU and PT. BTN has collaborated on CSR programs. This program was realized by providing facilities in the form of USU operational vehicles, parking pockets, and park management.

PT. BTN itself has also partnered with USU in apprenticeship programs, talent scouting, procurement of houses for USU lecturers, payment of tuition fees, and others. (©ULC)
