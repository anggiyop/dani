Ameilia Zuliyanti Siregar, the head of the USU International Community Service Team, highlighted the direct implications of urban entomology studies on public health and the urban environment, which is crucial in supporting food security in Indonesia and Malaysia.

An International Urban Farming Workshop, a collaborative effort between the University of North Sumatra (USU) and Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), was held on Monday, Aug. 11, 2024, at the School of Biological Sciences, USM. The project was led by Ameilia Zuliyanti Siregar, M.Sc., Ph.D., and supported by a team including Prof Ir Zulkifli Nasution, M.Sc., Ph.D., Ir Nismah Panjaitan, S.T., M.T., Ph.D., IPU ASEAN Eng, and Prof Tulus, Vor. Dipl. Math, M.Si., Ph.D., who also serves as the Head of the USU Institute for Research and Community Service (LPPM). The Kajihayat Science Study Center was represented by Dr. Nik Mohd Izham Mohd Nor, Prof Madya Ts, Dr. Abdul Hafiz Ab Majid, and Dr. Rosnida Tajuddin.

 

Ameilia Zuliyanti Siregar, the head of the USU International Community Service Team, highlighted the direct implications of urban entomology studies on public health and the urban environment, which is crucial in supporting food security in Indonesia and Malaysia. By mitigating disease transmission risks associated with vector insects and promoting eco-friendly environments, the research aims to enhance the overall health and quality of life for urban populations. Additionally, adopting sustainable pest control strategies can minimize adverse effects on biodiversity and urban ecosystems.

 

Urban farming programs, encompassing hydroponics, budikember (vertical gardens), vertical farming, polybag cultivation, and rooftop horticulture, offer potential solutions for bolstering urban food security in Medan, Indonesia, and Penang, Malaysia.

 

Prof. Tulus, the Head of LPPM USU, outlined the objective of this international collaboration: "The aim of this international community service between USU and USM is to identify and study insect species and environmental factors influencing pest populations and distribution through urban farming activities (hydroponics and budikember) in Medan, Indonesia, and Penang, Malaysia."

 

Dr. Nik Izham, leading the team from SBS USM, expressed his aspiration for this international endeavor to serve as a trailblazer for future collaborative initiatives between USU and USM, paving the way for further impactful activities.

 

The program was inaugurated by Prof. Dato' Dr Amirul Al-Ashraf Abdullah, the Dean of the School of Biological Sciences, USM. He underscored the significance of hydroponics, a soilless cultivation method, as a frontrunner in the agricultural revolution. By utilizing nutrient-rich water solutions, hydroponics enables cultivation within urban settings, particularly in apartments and densely populated areas, optimizing available space and resources. This technique not only boosts crop yields but also curtails water consumption and eliminates the need for pesticides, establishing it as a sustainable option for communities.

 

Prof. Zulkifli Nasution expressed his hope for the expansion of these activities in both countries, especially within densely populated urban regions in Penang and Medan.

 

Dr. Abdul Hafiz concluded the workshop, attended by final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students from China, Nigeria, Malaysia, and staff from the School of Biological Sciences, USM, with the wish for continued collaboration between USM and USU, yielding benefits for the community.
