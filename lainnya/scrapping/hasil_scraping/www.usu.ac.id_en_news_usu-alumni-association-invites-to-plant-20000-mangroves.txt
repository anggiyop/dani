In this audience, IKA-USU, initiated by PUI, LPPM, and KADIN North Sumatra, invited USU to collaborate in strategically planting 20,000 mangrove seedlings. This activity was carried out to support World Environment Day, which fell on June 8, 2024.

USU PR — The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., received an audience from the USU Alumni Association (IKA-USU) of North Sumatra. The event occurred in the Rector's Audience Room on Tuesday (Jun. 11, 2024)

In this audience, IKA-USU, initiated by PUI, LPPM, and KADIN North Sumatra, invited USU to collaborate in strategically planting 20,000 mangrove seedlings. This activity was carried out to support World Environment Day, which fell on June 8, 2024. Ir. H. Murlan Tamba, M.M, as the Daily Chair of PW IKA USU, together with Amelia Zuliyanti Siregar, M.Sc, Ph.D, as the Chair of the IKA USU Mangrove Planting Committee, directly invited the USU Rector to open the event, which will be held on June 22, 2024, in Beras Basah Village, Kabupaten.

"Yes, we invite the Rector to come and directly open the event," said the Chair of the IKA USU Mangrove Planting Committee.

Amelia Zuliyanti Siregar, M.Sc., Ph.D., added that this mangrove planting activity is the second time it has been carried out after planting 10,000 mangrove seedlings. She mentioned that there are many natural resources that can be developed there, one of which is Trigona cultivation, which has been developed with PUI Mangrove as a Superior Innovation Product that will be launched later with the name USU as the product label.

"Because it is a series of events in the process of planting 20,000 mangrove seedlings donated by BPDAS, with the transportation process carried out to USU, and the loading will probably start this week. The second thing we will focus on is because there are many natural resources there, including one Trigona cultivation, which we have developed with PUI Mangrove. We will develop this in the future as a superior, innovative product that will be launched later with the name USU, which will be labeled there," she explained.

With this, it is hoped that there will be follow-up activities such as the planting process to support the SDGs in the world, including the oxygen sources that will be produced along with the fishery resources that can be developed. In addition, alumni participation is also expected for future activities so that there is concrete evidence of alumni who are expected to be able to work and have an impact on the wider community.

Ir. Fauzi Yusuf, M.M, Chair of the Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division of IKA-USU, fully supports this activity and advised to take action for change. He said that any small step we take will be beneficial in mitigating the effects of climate change that are already in front of us.
