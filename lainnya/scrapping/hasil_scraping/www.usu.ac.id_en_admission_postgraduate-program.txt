About Postgraduate Program

The USU Postgraduate Program is an education program for undergraduates (S-1) of higher education to continue their studies at the master's level (S-2) to obtain a master's degree and at the doctoral level (S-3) to obtain a doctoral degree. The USU Postgraduate Program Selection is a selection for new students of the postgraduate programs, both the master’s program (S2) and the doctoral program (S3), which is carried out independently by the USU Postgraduate School. The selection is carried out in two stages, the Academic Potential Test (TPA) and interview selection.

The registration process is conducted online so prospective students from various locations can access it openly without having to come directly to the USU Postgraduate School. Currently, USU has 62 postgraduate study programs consisting of 40 master’s study programs and 22 doctoral study programs, with 6 study programs (2 doctoral study programs and 4 master’s study programs) under the direct management of the Postgraduate School.

Postgraduate programs provide great opportunities for students with the aim of improving and perfecting their respective scientific knowledge. Information on the selection of new Postgraduate School student admission related to registration procedures, registration requirements, types of exams, exam locations, exam schedules, and tuition fees can be accessed on the SPS admission website.
