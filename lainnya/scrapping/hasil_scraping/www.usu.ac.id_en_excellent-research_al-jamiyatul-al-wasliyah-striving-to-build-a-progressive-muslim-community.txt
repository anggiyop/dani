This study examines the development strategy of Al Jamiyatul Al Wasliyah as an Islamic civil society organization in Indonesia. Using a historical approach, it highlights the organization's role in politics, education, and da'wah in fostering an inclusive and moderate Islamic civilization.

History serves as a silent witness to humanity’s struggles in facing the challenges of time. In Indonesia’s historical journey, Al Jamiyatul Al Wasliyah is recorded as a pivotal pillar in shaping a civilization rooted in Islamic values. More than just a community, this organization emerged as a transformative movement driven by the spirit of unification, education, and societal development. Founded in 1930 in Medan, Al Wasliyah arose amid the fragmentation of the Muslim community due to differing perspectives. Instead of being consumed by internal conflicts, it positioned itself as a bridge to unite the ummah and drive positive change.

 

The importance of understanding this history motivated researchers from Universitas Sumatera Utara—Warjio, Junita Setiana Ginting, and Haykal M. Raihan—to collaborate with scholars from Universitas Islam Negeri Sumatera Utara, Nursapiah Harahap, and Zaharul Abdullah from the Center for Distance Education Studies (PPPJJ) at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). Through a historical approach, their study, titled "Development Strategy of Islamic Civil Society Organization (CSO) in Indonesia: A Case of Al Jamiyatul Al Wasliyah," explores the organization’s background and its political role in Indonesia’s development.

 

"Is there anything more remarkable than witnessing unity in diversity?"

Al Wasliyah emerged as a bridge of peace among Muslims divided by traditionalist and modernist views. By emphasizing hablum minallah (relationship with God) and hablum minannas (relationship with fellow humans), they reinforced the idea that Islam is a unifying force, not a divisive one. They reminded society that differences should not be a cause for division but rather an opportunity for mutual enrichment.

 

However, Al Wasliyah’s journey was not solely about uniting the ummah. They recognized a greater mission: contributing to Indonesia’s independence struggle. At a time when the nation was under colonial rule, Al Wasliyah stood at the forefront, rallying the Muslim community against oppression. Their fight was not just about seeking freedom but also about embodying it through education and da'wah. They wielded knowledge and moral values as their weapons, believing that true independence could only be achieved through an educated and dignified society.

 

After Indonesia gained independence, Al Wasliyah understood that maintaining sovereignty was just as crucial as attaining it. They ventured into politics—not as a political party, but through their members who held strategic positions in the legislative and executive branches. Herein lay their wisdom: Al Wasliyah viewed politics not as a battlefield but as a platform for advocacy in the interest of the ummah. Through a moderate approach, they ensured that the voices of Muslims were heard without inciting conflict. This, indeed, is the essence of noble politics—serving as a tool for collective welfare.

 

One of Al Wasliyah’s greatest legacies is its contribution to education. They firmly believed that education is the cornerstone of a progressive society. However, their vision extended beyond merely establishing schools. They integrated religious and secular education, preparing young Muslim generations to face contemporary challenges without losing their Islamic identity.

 

"We must ask ourselves: how many organizations dare to take the steps that Al Wasliyah has?" Warjio remarked.

They did not confine their educational efforts to Muslim-majority regions but also established schools in predominantly non-Muslim areas, such as Batak Toba. This was no easy feat. They faced cultural, social, and economic challenges. Yet, they persevered, driven by the belief that da'wah is not just about preaching but also about taking real actions that benefit all.

 

Additionally, Al Wasliyah’s openness to collaboration with other organizations set an exemplary precedent. Despite being rooted in the Shafi'i school of thought, they actively engaged with Muhammadiyah and other groups. This collaboration demonstrated that differences should not be barriers but rather windows to new perspectives. Al Wasliyah taught us that true strength lies in unity, not division.

 

No great journey is without obstacles, and Al Wasliyah is no exception. This study found that one of the organization’s major challenges is financial limitations. A centralized financial system often hinders innovation in fundraising, making it difficult to execute larger programs. This highlights the importance of creativity in overcoming financial constraints.

 

"Moreover, academic attention toward Al Wasliyah remains limited compared to organizations like Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama," Warjio added.

This presents both a challenge and an opportunity. It is a challenge because their significant contributions often go undocumented, but also an opportunity to introduce Al Wasliyah to a broader audience.

 

This research concludes that Al Wasliyah continues to move forward, grounded in the understanding that moderation is the key to success. By integrating religious, social, and cultural values, they have created an organizational model that remains relevant to modern societal needs. This moderation is not just about balancing tradition and innovation but also about fostering harmony amidst diversity. They do not merely dream of a better society—they actively work to achieve it.

 

In education, politics, da'wah, and philanthropy, Al Wasliyah has made an undeniable impact. Though their journey began in Medan, their influence extends across Indonesia. They have shown us that with a clear vision, unwavering commitment, and the courage to take action, nothing is impossible.

 

"The story of Al Wasliyah is one of hope, courage, and perseverance. They have proven that Islam is a religion of enlightenment, not darkness," Warjio concluded.

With every step, Al Wasliyah stands as a living testament that faith and progress are not opposing forces but two sides of the same coin. May their journey continue to inspire us all to build a better society—not just for today, but for generations to come.
