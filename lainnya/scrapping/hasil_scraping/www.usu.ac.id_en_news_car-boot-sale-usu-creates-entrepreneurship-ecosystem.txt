This activity can encourage USU academics to produce campus innovation products with a selling value that the community needs," said Prof. Muryanto

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a "Car Boot Sale USU Enterprise 2023" event at the USU Pendopo on Thursday (12/07/2023)

The Car Boot Sale USU Enterprise 2023 was an effort to showcase commercial products produced by USU academics. The event also featured products from the final practicum of the General Mandatory Course (MKWU) Entrepreneurship, which has opened ten classes using methods and curriculum from Babson College, US.

The Car Boot Sale was held using car facilities as exhibition stands to make it look more attractive and efficient. This is a strategic first step to provide information to the public about USU products that have commercial value and benefits that have been well-tested through a series of responsible research.

In his remarks, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., stated that the car boot sale will become one of the annual events that also periodically becomes a forum for market testing. This car boot sale was also created to attract investment interest from outside USU to become new investors for the innovative products produced.

"This activity can encourage USU academics to produce campus innovation products that have a selling value that is needed by the community," said Prof. Muryanto.

Head of USU BPRI, Buchari, S.T., M.Kes., said that through MKWU Entrepreneurship, students not only benefit from theory but also directly participate in the practice of building markets and products. So, the learning process is focused on the core concept and the realization of practice as a final exam for students.

"There are many benefits that students get from this activity; currently, there are still ten MKWU Entrepreneurship that use the entrepreneurship curriculum," said Buchari.

In line with this, the Entrepreneurship and Career Development Manager, Drs. Ami Dilham, M.Si, presented a proposal to hold this event twice a year with the aim of attracting wider participation. An increase in the number of participants will likely encourage the development of entrepreneurs.

Dany Sitompul, ST., M.M., as the Head Mentor of BPRI, hopes that an entrepreneurship ecosystem will be formed at USU, considering the potential increase in young entrepreneurs, especially students. The formation of this ecosystem is expected to support the university's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The dean stated that BPRI firmly supports the growth of entrepreneurs, especially among USU students.

"My response to their products is amazing because this is from one semester of learning entrepreneurship from various study programs," said Dany.
