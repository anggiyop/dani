“All of us have to build synergy. Especially for us who are on the same island, we need to continue to build strength, work hand in hand, help each other to achieve progress in the field of education. After all, we must collaborate and synergize to achieve our goals,” he said.

MEDAN-USU PR: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from the Universitas Jambi. The reception was held on Friday (25/2/2022) in the IMT-GT Meeting Room, USU's Central Administration Bureau. Present to receive the visit of USU Vice-Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH.MA., USU Vice-Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Sc., Apt, Vice-Rector IV USU Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc, and USU University Secretary Prof. Dr.dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG (K), and USU Expert Staff.

In his speech, Prof. Opim mentioned the importance of this activity to increase the synergy between the two universities. He said that universities should improve and strengthen synergies with other universities.

“All of us have to build synergy. Especially for us on the same island, we need to continue to build strength, work for hand in hand, and help each other achieve progress in the field of education. After all, we must collaborate and synergize to achieve our goals,” he said.

Prof Opim also hopes that this visit will open up further cooperation in the future. According to him, some many fields and areas can be collaborated in a cooperative bond. Plus, current educational progress requires interaction with all parties.

“Furthermore, we can continue cooperation such as student and lecturer exchanges. In addition, it is also possible that the Universitas Jambi can open an industrial faucet that becomes a place for internships for USU lecturers and students in Jambi, and vice versa, "he said.

In addition, he also appreciated the visit made. He said USU welcomed and was heartened by the visit. He said that since the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak, in-person visits like this have greatly decreased.

“We are very happy and heartened by this visit. It's been a long time since USU has received a direct visit since the covid pandemic. In this case, the Chancellor of USU also left a message that he was sorry he couldn't be with us because he was on an assignment to Jakarta," he said.

Rector of Universitas Jambi Prof. Drs. In his speech, H. Sutrisno, M.Sc., Ph. D expressed his gratitude for the welcome given. He said that the purpose of his visit was to share information and knowledge, especially in improving education services.

"We thank you for this welcome. Our aim here is not only to increase friendship and synergy but also to share information on various matters. One of them is regarding the achievement of the Main Performance Index (IKU) of higher education," said Prof. Sutrisno.

He said that Universitas Jambi currently has the status of a Public Service Agency (BLU) State University. It is different from USU, which currently has the status of a Legal Entity State University (PTNBH).

“Our current status is BLU, while USU is already PTNBH. So we are like brothers, one level below USU. That is why we came to discuss what the key performance achievements and targets are," he said.

He also hopes that in the future, Universitas Jambi and USU can collaborate in the Center for Excellence in Science and Technology (PUI), industry, further studies, especially in specialist doctor education. Jambi University has not held a Specialist Doctor Education Program such as USU until now. (RR)
