“You will face various challenges both academically and practically. You will sharpen your clinical skills, enhance your medical knowledge, and handle cases requiring diagnostic precision and decision-making accuracy,” explained Dr. Edy.

 

USU PR—The Faculty of Medicine at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a welcome ceremony for new students of the Doctoral Specialist Education Program (PPDS) in Occupational Safety and Health (MKK) and Subspecialists for the August 2024 period. The event, held on Friday (Aug. 9, 2024), was a hybrid session with an in-person session at the USU Faculty of Medicine Meeting Room and a virtual session via Zoom.

 

This handover marks the beginning of a journey that will shape the new students into professional and empathetic specialists. Every diagnosis they make and every decision will reflect the values of integrity, ethics, and dedication instilled in them on their first day at the USU Faculty of Medicine.

 

USU Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., warmly welcomed the new students with optimism. He highlighted the importance of maintaining integrity during their education in this specialist program, especially given the increasingly complex challenges in the healthcare field.

 

“You will face various challenges both academically and practically. You will sharpen your clinical skills, enhance your medical knowledge, and handle cases requiring diagnostic precision and decision-making accuracy,” explained Dr. Edy.

 

Addressing the realities ahead, Dr. Edy reminded the students that ethical issues, particularly related to sexual harassment, are a serious concern in the academic environment. USU is committed to strictly addressing such violations with severe penalties, including expulsion. He emphasized the importance of reporting any form of bullying or sexual violence and maintaining ethical behavior throughout their educational and professional journey.

 

“If there is any bullying, sexual violence, or other issues, please report them. We will strive to protect all students,” he concluded.

 

The handover ceremony marks the beginning of 114 PPDS students and 11 Subspecialist PPDS students starting their education at the USU Faculty of Medicine. USU Faculty of Medicine Vice Dean I, Dr. Delyuzar, M.Ked., Sp.PA(K) hopes that the new students will not only become experts in their fields but also serve as role models for society and future generations.
