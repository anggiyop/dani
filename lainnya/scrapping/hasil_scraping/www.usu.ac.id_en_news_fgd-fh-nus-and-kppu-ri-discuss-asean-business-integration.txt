So we help the government to spread knowledge and understanding to the public about economic integration in ASEAN because there are so many fields and perspectives. We also hope that this activity can identify problems that can later be continued in the form of research and other activities so that they can be sustainable, "explained the Dean of FH USU.

USU PR - Faculty of Law (FH) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) together with the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Business Competition Supervisory Commission of the Republic of Indonesia (KPPU RI) sat together at a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) discussing Business Readiness to Face ASEAN Economic Integration. This activity, which is classified as International Service, took place in the DPF Room of the USU Faculty of Law, on Monday (11/09/2023).

This FGD brought in two speakers, namely Ong Tze En Burton, EW Barker Center for Law & Business Faculty of Law NUS, and Chief of KPPU Regional Office I Medan, Ridho Pamungkas, S.I.P.

On this occasion, FH USU together with NUS and KPPU RI tried to provide an understanding to the public about ASEAN economic integration. According to the Dean of FH USU Dr. Mahmul Siregar, M.Hum, this topic has great urgency to be discussed considering ASEAN has strong economic potential, both producers and consumers.

"Now this can provide economic benefits if managed properly for the benefit of the community and our economy," said the Dean of FH USU.

The Dean of FH USU hopes that this discussion will target the community to raise public understanding of their position and role in the process of economic integration in ASEAN.

It was previously known that ASEAN has several economic agreements and formed a single market to integrate multilaterally and regionally.

"So we help the government to spread knowledge and understanding to the public about economic integration in ASEAN because there are so many fields and perspectives. We also hope that this activity can identify problems that can later be continued in the form of research and other activities so that they can be sustainable," he added.

Responding to this international community service activity, the Head of LPPM USU Prof. Dr. Tulus, Vor.Dipl.Math., M.Si., Ph.D. said that this FGD also helped USU and the Law Study Program to achieve international accreditation. The Chairperson of LPPM hopes that the business integration discussed in this discussion can be developed, especially in North Sumatra Province.

"In this regard, it is certainly beneficial for FH, for FH to move to international accreditation, both study programs and faculties," he said.

Chief of KPPU Regional Office I Medan, Ridho Pamungkas, S.I.P. said that his party expects input from stakeholders to help KPPU RI in maintaining the business competition climate.

On the other hand, a speaker from the Faculty of Law NUS Ong Tze En Burton assessed that the activity has good benefits for students as the next generation. According to him, young people must dare to face challenges and look for various opportunities related to the future.

"We always keep collaborating, from my side we cannot stand alone, we definitely need stakeholders, USU students provide input to us about studies that can be input for KPPU RI," said Ridho.
