“Therefore, our activity today is important and strategic in strengthening future planning visions,” he said.

USU PR—The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) welcomed the Ambassador of Canada to Indonesia, H.E. Jess Dutton, who was invited as the keynote speaker for a Guest Lecture. This Guest Lecture, themed "Canada's Indo-Pacific Strategy and Indonesia," was held at the Digital Learning Center Building on Wednesday (Jun. 12, 2024)

In his welcoming remarks, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., stated that the theme of the guest lecture is very important because of Indonesia's significant impact. The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a cross-sectoral and cross-border approach to promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.

“This strategy includes enhancing partnerships with countries in the region, emphasizing the importance of international legal norms, and promoting peace and stability,” he explained.

The Rector added that a key point in this strategy is the importance of cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries, with Indonesia as a main actor. Indonesia plays a crucial role in realizing the vision of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.

“Therefore, our activity today is important and strategic in strengthening future planning visions,” he said.

The Ambassador of Canada to Indonesia, H.E. Jess Dutton, delivered a message to strive for dreams and to keep dreaming. He also advised to study diligently and make the best use of time.

“My message to the youth, especially the students at USU, is to pursue your dreams and aspirations and continue to achieve what you aim for in the future,” he stated.
