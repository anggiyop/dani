Description

The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is warning the public to stay alert against fraud schemes conducted in the name of USU officials. This cautionary message is issued as a preventive measure to protect individuals from scams.

People are advised always to be vigilant whenever an unfamiliar individual contacts them, claiming to be a USU official. To avoid falling victim to such fraudulent acts, individuals should verify information directly through USU’s official service channels.

If anyone has any doubts or concerns, they can contact the official USU information service at +62 821-6888-9060. Additionally, more information can be accessed through USU’s official website at usu.ac.id and its verified social media accounts, including Instagram at official.usu and usuofficial and Facebook under the name Universitas Sumatera Utara.
