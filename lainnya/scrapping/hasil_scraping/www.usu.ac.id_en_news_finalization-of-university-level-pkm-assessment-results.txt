“I feel that the target can be jointly achieved through teamwork,” said Vice Rector I.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) immediately finalized the results of the University-level Student Creativity Week (PKM) Proposal Assessment at the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall, Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) on Thursday, (15/02/2024).

In accordance with the newly published PKM 2024 guidelines, the Universitas Sumatera Utara has now moved up to cluster 1, thus the Vice Rector I of USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A said that USU has a ranking target for USU at the National Student Science Week (PIMNAS) this year. WR I said this year USU must be able to enter the top 20 at PIMNAS.

“I feel that target will be achieved through teamwork,” said Vice Rector 1.

The increase in cluster has an impact on the number of proposal quotas, meaning that cluster 1 gets an additional proposal quota from 250 to 400.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A expressed his hope that through this PKM activity students can become young scientists in the future.

“These students are to become new young scientists in the future,” said Dr. Edy.

Head of the USU PKM Center, Ir. Erni Misran, S. T., M. T., Ph.D, said that this year USU received as many as 464 proposals for PKM 8 fields, 64 proposals for incentive schemes in the form of scientific articles and Written Futuristic Ideas (GFT).

“We received these 64 proposals in 2 publications, so in the first stage, it was still below the quota, even at that time we thought we were still in cluster 2. Your cooperation can (make) USU move up to cluster one,” said Ir. Erni.

On the same occasion, the Head of the USU PKM Center said that he would conduct a workshop as a follow-up to today's finalization activity. The workshop will be attended by 41 internal reviewers to provide assistance supported by the PKM Center and PKM Corner teams.

“After this, we will also conduct workshops, so we will invite internal reviewers to provide assistance that needs to be supported by the PKM center and PKM corner team,” said Ir. Erni.

Secretary of Ditmawalumni, Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi, M.Psi, said that in 2023 as many as 98 proposals received funding from the ministry and as many as 8 teams passed to PIMNAS. Therefore, she hopes that this year USU can send more teams than last year to PIMNAS this year.

“So the hope is from 100 and above to be able to open a gap to be able to enter PIMNAS more than 8 teams, last year 8 teams. hopefully this year more than 8 teams, at least 20 teams or 15 teams, at least twice as much as the previous year.
