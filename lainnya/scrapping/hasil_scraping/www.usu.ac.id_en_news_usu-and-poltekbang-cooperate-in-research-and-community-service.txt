Biro Penelitian, Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat dan Kerja Sama Universitas Sumatera Utara together with Politeknik Penerbangan (POLTEKBANG) Medan held an audience in the room of Wakil Rektor III on Thursday (01/26/2023). This audience opened by the Head of the Cooperation Section Cut Hayatun Wardani as and accompanied by the Head of the Academic Sub-Division, Febry Elviana.

Poltekbang is a vocational level university under the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of Indonesia. The form of cooperation that will be carried out later is in research and community service. Lecturers between Poltekbang and USU are obliged to collaborate to do a research.

This is also in line with USU's strategy of seeking practitioners from outside USU to carry out joint research and community service. Later this collaboration can also work by giving each other permission for the facilities of each campus to be used to support the implementation of cooperation. (SS)
