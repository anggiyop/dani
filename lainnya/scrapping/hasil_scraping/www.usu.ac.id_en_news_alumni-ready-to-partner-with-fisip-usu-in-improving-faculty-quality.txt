“We expect the cooperation of all alumni to help the progress of FISIP USU together,” added Vice Rector II USU.

USU PR - Taking the theme “Moving Forward with Alumni”, the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) successfully held its 44th Anniversary with great fanfare at the FISIP USU Hall on Wednesday, (20/11/2024).

Appreciation was expressed directly through remarks from USU Vice Rector II, Dr. Muhammad Arifin Nasution S.Sos., M.SP., regarding the strong desire and commitment held by FISIP USU as one of the faculties that focuses on the development of social and political science. Not only competent graduates are also expected to have integrity, global insight, and care for the interests of society.

FISIP has produced many alumni who contribute in various sectors, ranging from government, ministries, companies, community organizations, media, academics to the business world. According to Vice Rector II USU, alumni are important assets that can reflect the quality of education and become the face of the faculty, so the cultivation of values is a crucial point that must be owned.

“We expect the cooperation of all alumni to help the progress of FISIP USU together,” Arifin added.

In line with VIce Rector II USU's statement, Chairman of the FISIP USU Anniversary Committee, Drs. Heri Kusmanto, MA, Ph.D., added the urgency of the role of alumni to collaborate with USU stakeholders so that all goals become more directed. Through the power of togetherness, it will form a stronger synergy to move forward to meet the world class faculty through alumni input and assistance.

The Dean of FISIP USU, Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., MSP., said that the presence of alumni offers extraordinary sharing experience to support the enthusiasm of students towards a brilliant career. The Endowment Fund will also be boosted through cooperation with alumni. Achieving international accreditation is also one of the paths to follow so that there will be international interaction with foreign countries later.

“Alumni on this occasion share their experiences and knowledge so that they are not afraid to take steps to achieve success,” said the Dean of FISIP USU.

Alumni, lecturers, and students are the three elements that strengthen each other to raise the campus and achieve the goals that have been formulated. As explained by Dr. H. Dedi Iskandar Batubara, S.Sos., S.H., M.S.P., M.H., C.I.R.B.C., C.W.C., students become agents of social change who are able to stretch the future of the nation. It is very necessary to develop knowledge that is adapted to technological developments and the current world situation. Students are expected not to stop learning and prepare themselves to face all challenges in the future.

One of the series of activities is an oration that can motivate the entire FISIP USU community. Oration is also an inspiration for students to be enthusiastic in carrying out learning. In addition, there was also a change of alumni association, bazaar, jobfair, and many other entertainments.
