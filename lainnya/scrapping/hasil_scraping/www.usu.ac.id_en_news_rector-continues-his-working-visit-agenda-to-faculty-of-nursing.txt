“This year, we need to know about the obstacles and continue to innovate. Make adjustments,” said Prof. Mury during a working visit.

 

Public Relations USU - The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., conducted a Working Visit at the Faculty of Nursing. This Working Visit discusses efficiency policies that require adjustments in various sectors, especially in the tri dharma of higher education. Conducted at the Faculty of Nursing on Monday, (10/03/2025).

 

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., said that under the government's efficiency policy, every faculty member at USU must make savings, especially in the use of water, electricity, and office stationery equipment. Efficiency is also applied in implementing academic and operational activities by optimizing the available budget without reducing the quality of educational services.

 

In response, the USU Rector emphasized that each faculty member innovates amid budget constraints. This step is needed so the university can carry out its strategic programs.

 

“This year, we need to know about the obstacles and continue to innovate. Make adjustments,” he said during a working visit.

 

The innovation in question is that the Faculty of Nursing collaborates with various companies or institutions so students can intern or be recruited to work in these places.

 

Furthermore, the Dean of the Faculty, Dr. Dudut Tanjung, S.Kp., M.Kep., Sp.KMB., said that this working visit could harmonize indicators and convey the faculty's aspirations to the rector and his staff. He also said that the efficiency program would adjust and adapt to priority programs. 

 

“We cannot abandon the tri dharma program of higher education, whether it is learning in the classroom, lab, or hospital; of course, we will maintain it,” he said.

 

Finally, the Faculty of Nursing has increased its achievements in various fields, including superior accreditation in S1 and S2 programs and being the only faculty to achieve the Integrity Zone.
