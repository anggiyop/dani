USU’s Vice-Rector I further explained that USU routinely holds an Award Night for outstanding students at the national and international levels every year.

"Hopefully, this activity can still be carried out at the end of the year, and these outstanding students can receive appreciation from USU. Even if, in the future, the activity is canceled for one reason or another, maybe there will be compensation given to USU's outstanding students. This does not only apply to this IMT-GT event but to all events recognized by Puspresnas and Simkatmawa, correct, "he explained. (RJ)
