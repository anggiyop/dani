Through this program, participants are expected to understand and collaborate and become a place to exchange knowledge between academics, practitioners, and local communities. “We hope that participants can deepen their understanding of the importance of mangrove ecosystems and their contributions. This program is intended as a platform to exchange knowledge and experience. We believe through this we can overcome challenges and create solutions,” said Abdi Dharma, S. Kom., M. Kom.

 

Prof. Mohammad Basyuni, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D explained that the purpose of this program is to introduce and internationalize USU. Activities are also assembled in a more varied manner to introduce Medan and its surroundings directly. “The goal is to introduce and internationalize USU. In terms of excursions, there are more this year. We introduce Medan and its surroundings. Because it is better for people to see things firsthand. So this year, the event is more varied, “explained Prof. Mohammad Basyuni, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D.

 

Furthermore, Prof. Mohammad Basyuni, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D said that he strongly supports the internationalization of USU. Prof. Mohammad Basyuni, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D emphasized that Indonesia, as the owner of the largest mangrove forest in the world, offers opportunities for deeper exploration because mangroves play a very important role. “In the past, USU was more outgoing, now we invite people from outside to come here. Participants from outside want to learn because Indonesia is the home of the world's largest mangrove. Mangroves are very interesting to explore more deeply,” said Prof. Mohammad Basyuni, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D.
