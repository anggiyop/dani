About Tenis Lapangan USU Student Activity Unit

The Tenis Lapangan USU Student Activity Unit is one of the active sports student activity units at USU. The involvement of the Tenis Lapangan USU Student Activity Unit is evident as it offers private training for students who wish to learn, sharpen, and enhance their skills in tennis. As one of the sports organizations, the Tenis Lapangan USU Student Activity Unit actively participates in the IMT-GT Varsity Carnival sports event. In 2022, they achieved third place in the 21st IMT-GT Varsity Carnival held in Wailak, Thailand. Playing tennis can burn more calories compared to other popular physical activities such as leisure cycling, golfing, weightlifting, dancing, or playing volleyball. This student activity unit is highly recommended for students who want to maintain their health, excel in sports achievements, and actively participate in sporting activities.
