"This entrepreneurial spirit is not only to be an entrepreneur, but a spirit never to give up," said the Rector.

USU PR - Student Entrepreneurship Center (SEC) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Soft Opening Expo for Business Products for Students Participating in PMW (Student Entrepreneurial Program) USU 2021/2022. This event was held at USU's SEC Entrepreneur Lab Friday (28/01/2022).

In this event, there were 11 businesses launched covering technology-based products, fashion, and food. Eight of the 11 businesses result from the USU PMW 2021/2022, one from the 2019 PMW, which is still consistent, and two from the Entrepreneurship Study Program, Faculty of Economics and Business.

The Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si said that PMW's innovations could awaken the entrepreneurial spirit.

"This entrepreneurial spirit is not only to be an entrepreneur, but a spirit never to give up," he said.

The Rector added that enthusiasm alone is not enough, to win the competition, students must have ideas and dreams, then create a narrative to realize the idea.

“Describe the idea, how the idea can be implemented, what are the stages. Then, the narrative is implemented," he said.

According to Dr. Muryanto, the product produced from PMW, needs to increase the value of its product to compete in the Entrepreneurship Category 2022 Student Creativity Program competition. One thing that needs to be done is to assess whether this product is marketable and can compete in the market.

"We must not be satisfied with this product, we must continue to adjust whether many people like this product. Explore again how attractive packaging forms, the manufacturing process, and so on," he said.

He also hopes that this activity can motivate other students to be interested in innovating to have the capital to become entrepreneurs.

"We need to increase entrepreneurship students so that USU can become a university that has many innovations," he hoped.

On the same occasion, the Advisory Coordinator of PMW 2021/2022, Buchari, S.T., M.Kes. said, these eleven products already have business licenses issued by the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM).

Technology products will be directed to obtain patents and downstream, while food products will be assisted in obtaining halal certification and obtaining Home Industry Product (PIRT) permits.

"One year in the future, we will sustainably develop them so that they can grow and be able to take part in the PKM competition," he said.

Buchari added that SEC is preparing a training center that will function as incubation through coaching and mentoring.

"We will bring in mentors that are suitable for their business so that they can learn so that existing businesses can be consistent and become MSMEs who go up in class," he said.
