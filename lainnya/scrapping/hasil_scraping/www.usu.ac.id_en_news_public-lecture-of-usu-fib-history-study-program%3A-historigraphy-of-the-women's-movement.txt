"I quote from Sheila Rowbotham, a female historian who stated that "Women are interpreters of history, and as interpreters, women are often forgotten in world history or human history". When I focused on women's studies, when I wrote my thesis I was guided by Prof. Kuntowijoyo. I also take a quote from Kuntowijoyo “Why women rarely have an important role in writing Indonesian history”.

USU PR - USU History Study Program held a public lecture "Historiography of the Women's Movement" by presenting two speakers, namely Ita Fatia Nadia from the Archives and History of Indonesian Women, and Mutiah Amini, a lecturer in History at UGM.

Head of the USU FIB History S1 Study Program Dra. Lila Pelita Hati, M.Si said the public lecture aims to invite the younger generation to increase their love for history, especially the struggle of women.

"This activity is also expected to contribute ideas about the role of women in the history of our struggle," she said.

The activity itself is in collaboration with the History Science Masters Program which is chaired by Prof. Pujiati, MSoc., Sc., PhD. The initiator of the event Prof. Dr. Budi Agustono views that women have a history of their own movement in liberating the Indonesian nation. But unfortunately, so far the studies or research related to the role of women in our Indonesian history are still very minimal.

"Through this activity, it is hoped that ideas will emerge to further review the role of women in the history of our struggle," said the former Dean of USU FIB (Faculty of Cultural Studies)

Dra. Ita Fatia Nadia, MA who was presented as a speaker further discussed the raising of the red and white flag which rarely gets a place in the writing of Indonesian history, even though there were many women in the event. And in that event there were women who became flag bearers, this is interesting because women are the process of independence.

"I quote from Sheila Rowbotham, a female historian who stated that "Women are interpreters of history, and as interpreters, women are often forgotten in world history or human history". When I focused on women's studies, when I wrote my thesis I was guided by Prof. Kuntowijoyo. I also take a quote from Kuntowijoyo "Why do women rarely have an important role in writing Indonesian history," she said.

According to her, the central theme is closely dominated by the military, politics and this is history with a masculine perspective. Kuntowijoyo also stated that masculine history dominates Indonesian thought and historiography. History of women in gender perspective. In fact, she explained, after the proclamation of Indonesia's independence in 1945, male national leaders actively sought support from women's organizations. Attention to women's problems is unprecedented, male leaders provide guarantees of rights and equality for women in the 1945 Constitution.

"After the National Women's Congress in Klaten in December 1945 and the Congress in Solo in 1946, The Indonesian Women's Congress (KOWANI) was formed. KOWANI is a federation of women's organizations supporting Indonesian Independence," she explained.

She explained that in the 1950s a women's organization from the Indonesian Socialist Party emerged, namely the Socialist Women's Movement. Initially, PSI relied on its relationship with the women's movement through the Isteri Sedar organization. However, for the sake of the 1955 General Election, PSI felt the need to form its own women's wing. As a medium to expand the spread of Gerwani's ideas, in 1955 Gerwani published a magazine, “Wanita Indonesia”. Due to lack of progress and irregular publications, it was finally discontinued in mid-1956. After that, "Berita Gerwani" was published, whose circulation was limited to only 2,000 copies.

Meanwhile, Dr. Mutia Amini, MA explained that there are many women's names that have been omitted in our historical memory, so this has an impact on the lack of scientific research. Another problem, perhaps when the historical sources of women have been obtained, we historians have problems in understanding women.

"We write the history of the women's movement and the history of women, so that if we can solve this problem, then we can be free from the hoaxes and historiographical problems of Indonesian women's history. There are so many historical narratives that enter when digital media can mill around freely. So what we have read has been in research, we can explain something when we have done in-depth research," she said.

Based on the research she has done, there is a shift in the pattern in the women's movement. In the early 20th century in the emerging social movements there was a unity in groups of students, bureaucracy, journalists, etc. There are many newspapers that have been produced by women that bind organizations, bureaucracy, journalism, and the educated. There was an affiliation of female names with newspapers circulating in the early to mid 20th century.

"But at different times, there were divisions between the bureaucracy, organizations, the educated, and journalism which seemed to disappear especially after independence. There were almost no women's newspapers circulating in society. It was destroyed in the 1960s and up to the New Order, it can’t do any movement," she said.

"The independence of the nation is a joint struggle, both men and women, unfortunately this is rarely present in historiography. The presence of women in the bureaucracy is also a means of struggle to fight for women's rights," she said. (©ULC)
