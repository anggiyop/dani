MEDAN-PUBLIC RELATIONS USU: The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., inaugurated 2,208 the Universitas Sumatera Utara graduates who had completed their studies from June to August 2021. The USU graduation period IV for the 2020/2021 academic year was held online via streaming usuofficial's youtube channel, Thursday (9/16/2021).

In his speech, the USU Rector reminded the graduates to be able to maximally fulfill their intellectual mandate in helping to overcome various humanitarian problems.The knowledge they gained in college will be tested in a professional capacity in the world of work in accordance with the scholarly competencies that have been achieved.When a pride in a bachelor's degree is not accompanied by academic responsibility, it will only generate to intellectual arrogance that is misleading.

“The bachelor's degree you earned today must be continued with hard work to make a major contribution to global change.The world is currently undergoing enormous and rapid changes.The Covid-19 pandemic is the toughest challenge in various aspects of human life.Restrictions on space for movement and social interaction, economic slowdown, unemployment and changes in lifestyle are a series of problems from the impacts we face in the pandemic era.Everyone needs their role and participation not only to survive in the midst of the pandemic, but also to move forward and make life better than ever before," the USU Rector said.

He said the graduates must be able to become problem solvers in various problems that entangle the people and the nation.As a generation that represents the spirit of global change and renewal in all fields, the graduates are expected to become the next high-level generation in the digital era, which will be able to take part and compete not only in the local realm, but also at the national and global levels.

Muryanto reminded, the challenges ahead are not getting easier.However, with the spirit, ability and youthful energy possessed, these challenges will be able to be overcome properly."Young people are a great force that is expected to be able to find strength when overcoming all difficulties in managing ideas that give birth to important innovations as the forerunner of a creative industry that has never been thought of to solve social problems," he said.

Graduates who have undergone the educational process are mandated to produce two criteria at once in themselves, namely actively helping to overcome humanitarian problems and contributing to advancing Indonesia.

“Through innovation, various patterns of human transformation from the old way of life to the new pattern of life with the use of technology are made possible quickly.Employment expansion from fields of work that were previously traditional will gradually be replaced with jobs that require hi-tech skills and abilities.New professions will emerge with increasing demands for thestandardization of knowledge and skills possessed by university graduates.The knowledge gained in lectures must be continuously added, updated and modified with other sciences in order to produce ideas that are in line with the needs of the times and the human resources needed by the global market, "said Dr Muryanto.

He also emphasized that the current natural, social and humanitarian problems can no longer be solved by one discipline, but using multidisciplinary cross-contributions.All competencies needed are hybrid competencies between one science and another.There is no more superiority of science.The Universitas Sumatera Utara participates in encouraging the creative and innovative process of mixing knowledge through the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka policy, which provides flexibility for students to study other fields of science as well as opportunities for internships in the field that is their passion.Currently, as many as 15 students from the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) have successfully passed the selection conducted by PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk and USU in the recruitment activity for the Independent Special Region Leadership Candidate (CPDK).There were also 60 USU students who passed the internship selection organized by USU and PT Pos Indonesia.

USU's vision to become a university that has academic excellence as a barometer of scientific progress, which is able to compete at the global level is the vision that underlies all of USU's progress.This is in line with the demands of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 to integrate smart education with increasing and equalizing the quality of education, expanding access and relevance in realizing world class.Learning interactions are carried out through collaborative and participatory classes in compiling blended learning, project based-learning, flipped classrooms and so on through public interactions and digital interactions.

USU keeps on strengthen research, innovation and publication lines that are synergized with community service, to produce products that are needed by the community in improving their standard of living and solving various existing problems.USU will also make changes to institutional governance, namely by revising the agile organizational structure and meeting organizational performance achievements, improving the quality of lecturers and education staff resources.In addition, it also revitalizes all infrastructure facilities in the principle of sharing tools and strengthens owned laboratory facilities.For the academic field, a very important substance that will be adapted is increasing the ability to digitize the learning process through a hybrid learning process and facilitating the creation of collaborative and participatory classes.

“We must all be prepared to migrate from analog citizens to digital citizens or at least to become digital smart users in the learning process.An important issue in the field of research and community service is to increase applied research through research groups with appropriate TKT to achieve downstreaming.The scientific products produced by USU must have commercialization value by involving the industry in sharing funding and experiences that benefit both parties.To accelerate the implementation of this transformation, it is hoped that the role of Professors as leaders to foster scientific developments at USU will have an impact on offering practical solutions to social problems and public policies by strategic industries as well as government and community institutions," he concluded.

The inaugurated graduates consist of 20 people from the doctoral program, 155 masters program people, 5 masters programs and specialist doctors, 36 specialist doctor education programs, 1 specialist dentist education program, 36 master doctor programs, 214 education programs professions, 1,148 people from undergraduate programs and 593 people from diploma programs.(RJ/©ULC)
