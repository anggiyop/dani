USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si said that the form of Corporate Social Responsibility carried out by Bank BTN is in the form of infrastructure development. Previously, Bank BTN had several times provided assistance to USU in the form of procurement or repair of the infrastructure. It is known that later improvements will be made to the public park for students.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) together with Bank BTN held a Fun Run event. The activity took place in the courtyard of the USU Rector's Bureau on Thursday (8/11/2022).

This activity is a form of collaboration between USU and Bank BTN. The format of the event started with a morning run, breakfast together, entertainment events, and ended with the handing over of placards between USU and Bank BTN.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si said that the form of Corporate Social Responsibility carried out by Bank BTN is in the form of infrastructure development. Previously, Bank BTN had several times provided assistance to USU in the form of procurement or repair of the infrastructure. It is known that later improvements will be made to the public park for students.

"This is build-up infrastructure facilities from the Deputy President Director symbolically and this is not the first time. BTN has always provided great assistance for the procurement or repair of infrastructure at USU," the USU Rector said.

The Rector said this event was a way to share with each other even though it was not in a formal situation. The activity itself is carried out with a family atmosphere and familiarity so that it will produce more productive things and bring positive energy while exercising.

"Yes, this is a way that we can share with each other, therefore, it's not in a formal atmosphere, the atmosphere is kinship which will produce more productive results and positive energy while exercising," he said. (©ULC)
