The morning is half over, inching towards noon with warming sunlight. The clear blue sky shaded the Moot Court Building located in the Faculty of Law, Universitas Sumatera Utara. The optimistic atmosphere lasted from Friday (4/2/2022) to Saturday (5/2/2022). The crowd did not seem to stop in the faculty that was in the midst of celebrating its 68th Anniversary.
