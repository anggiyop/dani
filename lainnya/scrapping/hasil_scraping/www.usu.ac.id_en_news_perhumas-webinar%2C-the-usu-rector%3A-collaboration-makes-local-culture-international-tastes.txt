USU PUBLIC RELATIONS - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Dr. Muryanto Amin said, in the promotion of culture, collaboration from all parties is needed. This collaboration will turn local culture into international tastes.

“Not only one party is trying to do this. There must be collaboration," said Mury at the Public Relations Talk Series 7 of the Young Public Relations Association (Perhumas) with the headline Talking North Sumatra, Talking Culture on Monday (9/27) online.

Muryanto emphasized the collaborative role of the campus, community, and government. “Campuses, communities, and also the government must work hand in hand to realize sustainable cultural promotion. It can't be done if only one element works," Mury said.

He added that the role of the campus as a higher education institution is also very important. The campus is a center for cultural studies and development. Culture must be developed through research and review.

“At USU itself, I encourage the Faculty of Cultural Studies to become a center for cultural studies. We are currently working to meet their needs,” he said.

The Rector explained that currently there is a tendency for people, especially young people, to be reluctant about culture.

“Many young people today are reluctant to have anything to do with culture. We admit that, for example, like traditional clothes, we need extra time to prepare them, but there should be potential for innovation in how to use culture to be simpler without leaving the meaning of the culture itself," said Mury.

Umri Sulthony, Head of the Provincial Culture and Tourism Office, explained that North Sumatra is rich in culture. Many ethnic groups and tribes in North Sumatra have their own characteristics.

“Talk about North Sumatra, talk about culture. There are many tribes and cultures in North Sumatra, so we cannot highlight just one culture to describe North Sumatra. This is the wealth we have,” said Zumri.

He invites people to increase their love for local culture. With this love, it becomes the main capital to improve and promote a local culture.

“We primarily expect us to love our culture. This is a capital for us to be able to promote our culture. Culture is not only dancing, but clothing, culinary also are part of culture,” he said.

The Perhumas webinar activity itself was filled with remarks from the Chairman of BPC PERHUMAS Medan, Saurma MGP Siahaan, M.I.Kom, MIPR, and speakers including USU FIB Lecturer, Drs. Irwansyah, M.A., Director of IR & IR Songket Deli, Irfania Ramadhani Lubis and 2020 North Sumatra Cultural Ambassador Fellix Rimba.(©ULC)
