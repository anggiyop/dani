“We hope that this MoU will lead to the creation of outstanding, job-ready graduates who contribute to national development and the improvement of public welfare,” Prof. Muryanto said.

USU PR — Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and Universitas Nahdlatul Ulama (UNUSU) have officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the start of a strategic collaboration between the two institutions. The signing ceremony took place at UNUSU’s campus on Thursday, Aug. 15, 2024.

 

USU’s Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., expressed his appreciation and optimism about the partnership. He emphasized that the MoU would serve as a foundation for deep collaboration, particularly in supporting the implementation of the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) program, which will involve faculties, institutions, and units from both universities.

 

“We hope that this MoU will lead to the creation of outstanding, job-ready graduates who contribute to national development and the improvement of public welfare,” Prof. Muryanto said.

 

The collaboration encompasses various aspects of the Tri Dharma Perguruan Tinggi, including education, training, research, and institutional development. Both universities are committed to enhancing human resources through activities that support the advancement of knowledge and innovation.

 

With the signing of this agreement, Prof. Muryanto hopes that the relationship between USU and UNUSU will strengthen and positively impact both institutions as well as the nation. The success of the partnership will be measured to evaluate future collaborative efforts.

 

“This collaboration is not just about signing a document; we need to measure the success of the program's implementation to evaluate future steps,” Prof. Muryanto added.

 

UNUSU’s Rector, Dr. Ibnu Affan, S.H., M.Hum., expressed his pleasure and highlighted the value of collaborating with USU, a prominent university in Medan. He hopes that the MoU will be more than just a document and will lead to effective implementation.

 

“We sincerely hope for USU’s supervision so that we can further develop, both in terms of human resources and other aspects,” Dr. Ibnu Affan said. He also noted that the collaboration would help enhance the capacity of UNU’s teaching staff, particularly in areas with a shortage of lecturers, such as public health.

 

“We look forward to learning from USU, and with their guidance, we hope to improve our accreditation status,” he added.
