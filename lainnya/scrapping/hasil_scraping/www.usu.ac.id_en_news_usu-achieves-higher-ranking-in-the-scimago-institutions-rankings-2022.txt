USU has risen one place to become the 6th position on the list of the best universities in Indonesia after last year being in the 7th. Internationally, USU has improved its ranking from previously being in 708 position to 620 or up 88 ranks.

USU MEDAN-PR: The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) recorded an achievement in the first quarter of 2022. As reported on its official website, USU rose in rank in the 2022 Scimago Institutions Rankings (SIR). USU rose one place to the 6th position on the list of the best universities in Indonesia after last year being in the 7th. Internationally, USU improved its ranking from the previous 708 position to 620 or increased by 88 ranks.

In response to this, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, said this was an encouragement for USU. USU is currently carrying out a series of transformations to improve USU's image and ranking in the world.

“Alhamdulillah, USU achieved an increase in the rankings carried out by the Scimago Institutions Rankings. This momentum must be maintained for the good of USU. This shows that the transformation carried out has shown good progress and initial results.

He encouraged USU not to be complacent but to motivate themselves to be better.

"USU's future target is to produce 3,000 articles published in reputable international journals. Besides that, it encourages the academic community to produce innovations in solving social problems," Muryanto Amin said.

The Chair of USU World Class University, Prof. Dr. Eng Himsar Ambarita ST, MT, added that USU would continue to focus on assessment indicators. By fulfilling the existing requirements, he hopes that USU can continue to climb up in the rankings.

“The SRI methodology is based on 3 major indicators, namely Research, Innovation and Societal. This increase was driven more by improvements in the fields of Innovation and Research. This is a very good base to improve USU's performance in the future," he said.

Prof Himsar also feels grateful for this achievement and hopes that all parties will intensify the transformation efforts that are being carried out. “We are very grateful for this because the transformation process that is being launched by USU has started to show improvement. These results are also used as the basis for formulating accelerated programs and also improving academic services at USU. As an institution, USU must be able to conduct research and produce innovations that are useful for the community," Prof. Himsar said.

Not only through the SIR assessment agency, USU is currently also participating in the assessment process at several rating agencies, both national and international. Among them are Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings, Times Higher Education University Ranking, to the ranking of universities by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, Technology, and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia.
