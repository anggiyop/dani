“Discuss with each other and don't hesitate to ask questions so that the discussion is very interactive,” said Dr. Joverdia in her speech.

 

Public Relations USU - The Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) together with the Sumbagut Oil and Gas Special Task Force - Contractor Cooperation Contract (KKKS) North Sumatra Region conducted a Public Lecture with the theme “Introduction to the Upstream Oil and Gas Industry”. It was held on Tuesday (25/02/2025).

 

The public lecture brought speakers from the oil and gas industry and a USU anthropologist to discuss the dissemination of the results of good practices of cooperation between the upstream industry and higher education institutions in research to examine social, political, and cultural relations between the upstream oil and gas industry and the surrounding community.

 

The remarks of Vice Rector I, represented by the Secretary of Development and Education of USU, Dr. Joiverdia Arifiyanto, S.H., M.H., highly welcomed this public lecture and was a continuation of the previous collaboration with SKK Migas Sumbagut. With interactive discussions, students can have the opportunity to exchange ideas.

 

“Discuss with each other and don't hesitate to ask questions so that the discussion is very interactive,” said Dr. Joverdia in her speech.

 

The anthropologist of FISIP USU, Fikarwin Zuska, said the purpose of the public lecture was to introduce matters related to the upstream oil and gas sector more widely. He advised the students who attended this public lecture to research the community around upstream oil and gas.

 

“The aim is to introduce more widely what is upstream oil and gas. So that's roughly why it was also held at FISIP,” he said.

 

Yanin Kholison, head of the Department of Formalities and Communication of SKK Migas Sumbagut, said that a Migas Center or Migas Corner would be created at USU. This center would function to obtain information about SKK Migas and matters related to the oil and gas sector.

 

“We make a migas center or corner because USU is part of the stakeholders from North Sumatra and part of the work of Sumbagut,” he said.

 

Finally, with the public lecture conducted by FISIP, students know earlier about the challenges of this industry, not only prioritizing a technical approach but also hoping that students will be able to contribute to smooth operations.
