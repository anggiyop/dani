Welcome, new students of Universitas Sumatera Utara! It seems that the sentence began to echo in the blue sky that overshadowed the Universitas Sumatera Utara Campus at the beginning of the second week of August 2021. On August 12 to 13, an official welcome will enthusiastically welcome the new students (freshmen) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara for the 2021/2022 academic year through the virtual realm in the title of Introduction to Campus Life for Students (PKKMB), which was held in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
