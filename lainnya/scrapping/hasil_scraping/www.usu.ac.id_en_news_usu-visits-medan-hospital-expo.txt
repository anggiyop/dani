"So it is similar to our theme transformation towards to ultimate because indeed change is a necessity in the health sector, especially in this digital era, where everything should be easier, easier and more advanced in patient handling," he said.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara, represented by the University Secretary, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp. O.G, Subsp. F.E.R attended the Seminar, Workshop Perumahsakitan XIV and Medan Hospital Expo XII Perhimpunan Rumah Sakit Seluruh Indonesia (PERSI) North Sumatra Region. This activity was held at Santika Premiere Dyandra Hotel Medan on Wednesday (02/21/2024).

This series of activities carries the theme "Hospital Readiness in Transforming Activities in the Digital Age." Prof. Fidel said this theme is very much in line with USU's vision, mission, and theme, Transformation Towards Ultimate, which emphasizes transformation in all fields, especially in the digital era. In this case, the hospital is transforming to provide facilities and improve patient services.

"So it is similar to our theme transformation towards to ultimate because indeed change is a necessity in the health sector, especially in this digital era, where everything should be easier, easier and more advanced in patient handling," he said.

Prof. Fidel added that this activity also involved the role of institutions, especially USU, which has a hospital. Every hospital is expected to continue to transform following technological developments. One of them concerns health facilities that must be adequate in every service. Hospitals must also be responsive to public complaints.

"Our role as an institution is that we have a hospital, whether it is a general hospital or a dental and oral hospital, and of course, we must also be ready for society's transformation in this digital era," he added.

According to information, this activity also carries out health checks, such as checking blood sugar, blood fat, cholesterol, and blood type. Visitors can also donate blood through PMI.
