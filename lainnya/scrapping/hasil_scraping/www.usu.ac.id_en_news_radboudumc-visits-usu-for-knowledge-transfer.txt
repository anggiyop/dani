This visit discussed the cooperation between USU and Radboudumc. The two universities have collaborated for more than 30 years. The collaboration between the two is aimed at transferring knowledge.

Doctor Inke Nadia Diniyanti Lubis M.Ked(Ped)., Sp.A, Ph.D, hopes that after this visit, cooperation can be realized again by signing a memorandum of understanding and implemented in a cooperation agreement.

Several forms of cooperation that have been planned by the USU Medical Faculty are holding guest lectures, student exchanges, and sending staff to Radboudumc to exchange knowledge.

"The next step is to sign the MoU and MoA between USU and Radboudumc," doctor Inke said.

Meanwhile, Radboudumc offers students to work with specialized teams such as performing cleft lip, palate, and hand surgeries. Consultant Plastic Surgeon Univ. Prof. Dr. Paup H.M. Spauwen said he wanted to treat patients at the same time and teach and train students like teaching about surgery when an operation is taking place at the same time.

"I really hope we can offer something for students because we work with a highly specialized team there," Prof. Paup said.

Dr. dr. Eddy Sutrisno Hendrowasito SpBP-RE(K), a USU Faculty of Medicine lecturer, hopes that after this there will be USU students sent directly to Radboudumc to conduct research.

"Five years ago, students there were sent to USU to conduct research, when do USU students go there to carry out research," Eddy mentioned. (©ULC)
