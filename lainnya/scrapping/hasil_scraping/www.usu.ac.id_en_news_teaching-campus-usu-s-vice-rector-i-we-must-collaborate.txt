USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Socialized the Registration of the USU Partner Teaching Campus Program on Monday (30/01/2023) via zoom meeting.

This socialization activity guest speakers Teaching Campus Coordinator Wida Akasah, S.Agr., M.Sc, and USU Partner Teaching Campus Alumni Dio Syafaruddin.

USU Vice Chancellor I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs said that stakeholders at USU must try to achieve success targets in every program promoted by the government, such as the involvement of Field Supervisors, as well as tools for monitoring and evaluation.

"What must be prepared to be able to see all the processes of implementing the Teaching Campus program are by the minimum standards. We can no longer just let it go. Therefore, the involvement of DPL, the involvement of tools for monitoring and evaluation, is very important," explained WR I USU.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan also thinks that deans and academicians can keep in touch by working together to fix significant problems. Among these activities is the Ministry's building of learning platforms and modules that students can use to follow lectures on campus.

"I hope deans, deputies, and academic fields can continue coordinating. We collaborate and improve everything. I want to convey to all the students and the field assistant lecturers to adjust to the platform developed by the Ministry's teaching campus. The modules are already in place, so it's not something extraordinary. Although there is still an opportunity to do improvisation and so on," he said.

Teaching Campus Coordinator resource person Wida Akasah, S.Agr., M.Sc explained the technicalities of registering for the teaching campus program, starting with the files to be prepared, the registration timeline, and the benefits. Dio Syafaruddin, a USU Partner Teaching Campus Alumni with a placement at SD 064027 Medan Polonia, also shared his experience while participating in this ministry program.
