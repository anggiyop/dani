So far, most students before knowing this program, right, did data analysis manually, and this certainly takes time in data analysis. With digital programs with NVIVO, we hope that the acceleration of student studies can be accelerated so that the acceleration of student studies will increase the accreditation of study programs," he said.

USU PR - The Master of Linguistics (PMSL) Program at the Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB), Universitas Sumatera Utara, conducted a webinar "Workshop on Qualitative Data Analysis with NVivo". The webinar was conducted virtually via Zoom Meeting, on Wednesday (16/08/2023).

NVivo itself stands for NUD*IST and Vivo. NUD*IST means Non-Numerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching and Theorizing), while Vivo itself means coding based on what participants experience in the field. Thus, NVivo can be interpreted as software used to analyze and compile qualitative data.

Prof. Dr. Drs. Mulyadi, M.Hum, the Head of the Linguistics Study Program, said that after this workshop the Linguistics Study Program students could easily and quickly conduct research.

"So that students of the Linguistics Doctoral program can be easier and faster in conducting data analysis using the NVIVO program. So far, most students before knowing this program, right, do data analysis manually and this certainly takes time in data analysis. With digital programs with NVIVO, we hope that the acceleration of student studies can be accelerated so that the acceleration of student studies will increase the accreditation of the study program," he said.

Secretary of the Linguistics Study Program, Dr. Gustianingsih, M.Hum, said that the target was to prepare an MoA with Bengkulu University.

"This S3 Linguistics Study Program with Bengkulu University can be created. Currently, we are preparing an MoA with Bengkulu University and the Linguistics Doctoral Program at Universitas Sumatera Utara, which also collaborates with the deans and deans, because the deans and deans, both Vice Dean I, Vice Dean II, and Vice Dean III are very supportive of this collaboration,” she explained.

As the speaker, Dr. Eko Risdianto, S.Si., M.Cs., from Bengkulu University explained that the purpose of this activity was that educators or students in the Linguistics Study Program could process data better.

"Of course it is very helpful for you in later visualizing, exploring data, then visualizing data. And later you will get more valid research conclusions, yes, than if we use it manually," he explained.
