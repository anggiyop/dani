"Since 57 years ago, of course, there are many hopes for the future. One of them is to achieve more brilliant achievements, both at the national, regional and international levels," FIB Dean Dr. Dra. T. Thyrhaya Zein, MA said.

Welcoming the 57th Anniversary, the USU Faculty of Cultural Sciences held a series of events to enliven the anniversary, 9/8/2022.

FIB Dean Dr. Dra. T. Thyrhaya Zein, MA said that 57 years is not a young age anymore. That way we must be more mature so that later we will develop the Tridharma of Higher Education.

"Since 57 years ago, of course, there are many hopes for the future. One of them is to achieve more brilliant achievements, both at the national, regional and international levels," he said.

The Dean hopes that later he will be able to realize the rector's program, namely internationalization.

Chairman of the Committee Dr. Rudy Sofyan, SS, M.Hum said that this activity was the first time there was a crowd after the pandemic.

He hopes that this activity can be a welcoming party, a welcome celebration for new students and at the same time inviting students in 2021 to be able to meet their lecturers.

With this activity, there will be a return to the existing emission bonds, and can make the past 57 years an experience to be able to improve and increase the effectiveness of the performance of the USU FIB academic community. (©ULC)
