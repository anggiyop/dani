“These alumni are extraordinary. They spread in various regions and positions but still remember the alma mater. The renovation of the main courtroom will be very useful for younger students in improving their achievements,” said the Dean of FH USU.

USU PR - The Faculty of Law, Universitas Sumatera Utara (FH USU) held a grand reunion of Alumni Class of 1989, an event that is not only a gathering event but also reflects the commitment of alumni in supporting the development of the almamater. The activity, which was attended by alumni from various regions, took place at the FH USU Hall. On Saturday (11/24/2024).

In his remarks, the Dean of FH USU, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum., emphasized the importance of alumni contributions in supporting the improvement of the quality of education in the faculty. One of the contributions highlighted was the renovation of the main courtroom of the Moot Court.

“These alumni are extraordinary. They are spread in various regions and positions but still remember the alma mater. The renovation of the main courtroom will be very beneficial for the younger students in improving their achievements,” said Dr. Mahmul.

The renovated main courtroom is now a more representative and modern facility, so that it can support the implementation of various academic activities. Faculty of Law USU itself has been known as one of the institutions that often wins the national level Moot Court competition. The Dean of Faculty of Law USU hopes that this new facility will further motivate students to continue to excel.

“With better facilities, I am sure students will be more comfortable in practicing and preparing themselves. Their achievements so far have been extraordinary, especially if supported by adequate facilities like this,” he added.

The Chairperson of the Alumni Gathering, Junita Sari Ujung, S.H., M.Kn., explained that the reunion preparation process required intensive coordination. Although most of the alumni had busy schedules, communication through WhatsApp groups was an effective solution to bring them together.

“We started the preparation by forming a small team of 12 people, then distributed invitations through communication technology. Alhamdulillah, many were enthusiastic and adjusted their time to attend,” said Junita.

The choice of reunion location on campus is also part of the strategy to strengthen emotional ties with the alma mater. The Alumni Gathering Chairperson added that this event also presented senior lecturers who had taught the 1989 batch, thus creating a warm and memorable atmosphere.

“We want this event to be an opportunity to return home, see firsthand the development of the campus, and make a real contribution. By being held at Faculty of Law USU, the nostalgic atmosphere becomes more pronounced,” he continued.

Apart from contributing to the development of facilities, alumni also want to encourage students to continue their education to a higher level. According to the Chairman of the Alumni Gathering, the reunion is not just a nostalgic event but also a form of commitment to have a positive impact on the faculty and the next generation.

“We want to be more solid as an alumni community. In addition, we also hope to be a source of inspiration and help for younger students on campus. Whatever we achieve today, it all started here, from Faculty of Law USU,” he explained.
