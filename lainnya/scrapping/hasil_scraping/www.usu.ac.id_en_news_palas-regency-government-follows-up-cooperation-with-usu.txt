Zarnawi said that there were many things that Palas and USU could collaborate on. These include education, health, agriculture, as well as fisheries and development.

PR USU - The Padanglawas Regency Government (Palas Regency Government) is following up the collaboration with the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU).

The follow-up to the collaboration between USU and the Palas Regency Government (Pemkab Palas) in various fields was attended by the Acting Regent of Palas, Ahmad Zarnawi Pasaribu, with the Rector of USU, Muryanto Amin, in the audience room of the USU Rector's Bureau, Friday (7/8/2022).

Zarnawi said that there were many things that Palas and USU could collaborate on. These include education, health, agriculture, as well as fisheries and development.

"The purpose of this collaboration is to improve the quality of community human resources and the State Civil Apparatus (ASN) in Palas," said Zarnawi.

Zarnawi also said, although previously there had been cooperation in the field of community service, cooperation in other fields such as education, livestock, and regional development also needed to be done.

"It is also possible to open including the creation of USU's PSDKU (Outside Main Campus Study Center)," Zarnawi said.

In addition to the cooperation between the Palas Regency Government and USU, Zarnawi hopes that the relationship between USU and Palas will improve in the future.

"We also hope that the establishment of good cooperation between the Palas Regency Government and USU can help rural communities who are the targets of the community service program," Zarnawi said.

USU Rector Muryanto Amin said USU was ready to cooperate with the Palas Regency Government. "Basically, USU is ready to cooperate, certainly with fields or sections that allow cooperation," Muryanto said.

Muryanto also said that USU is currently building cooperation with the Palas Regency Government in the field of community service.

"Surely we’re ready to implement what is possible for USU in the future," said Muryanto. (©ULC)
