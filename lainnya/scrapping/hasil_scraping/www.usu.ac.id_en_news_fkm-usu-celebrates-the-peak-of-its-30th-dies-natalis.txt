This is one of the achievements mentioned earlier, having quite significant performance. Both in developing contributions, improvements, and increasing performance,” said Prof. Muryanto.

USU PR- The Faculty of Public Health (FKM) at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the peak celebration of its 30th Dies Natalis, with the theme ‘The Role of Public Health in Building Community Resilience in the Digitalization Era.’ The event took place at FKM USU on Tuesday (12/19/2023).

Various activities were conducted to enliven the peak of Dies Natalis. These included silat and regional dance performances; Scientific Orations titled “Inovasi Tiada Henti Dalam Mencapai & Menjaga Kesinambungan Universal Health Coverage”(Endless Innovation in Achieving & Maintaining Universal Health Coverage); the presentation of FKM Awards to Alumni; fashion show; bazaar; creative gymnastics and health checks.

In his virtual opening address delivered via a video, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., expressed his joy over FKM USU reaching 30 years. The Rector also appreciated the quite significant progress in performance. This is indicated by the accreditation of its S1 program, which is accredited excellently by LAM-PTKes, as well as the good management of FKM USU infrastructure.

“This is one of the achievements mentioned earlier, having quite significant performance. Both in developing contributions, improvements, and increasing performance,” remarked Prof. Muryanto.

Dean of FKM USU, Prof. Dr. Dra. Ida Yustina M.Si., stated that the achievement of FKM USU students has increased by more than 200% in 2023. They have been reviewing past achievements year after year to improve student performance continuously. In their effort to enhance it, they have implemented certain strategies. One such strategy is through Puspita (Student Achievement Center).

“Thank God, we see good results, inseparable from the guiding lecturers' role. So, from the beginning, they enter, we identify their talents, and then we strengthen them through workshops and training,” revealed Prof. Ida.

Further, Prof. Dr. Dra. Ida Yustina M.Si. explained that FKM USU continuously carries out various efforts and strategies to achieve performance targets. The focus is always on how to meet or exceed the set targets. The strategies applied vary depending on the issues faced.

“What we aim to achieve for the next year is certainly IKU. Like in internationalization, we will strive to contribute to improving USU's ranking at the global level,” asserted Prof. Ida.

Chair of the Dies Natalis Committee of FKM USU's 30th anniversary, Dani Syahputra Bukit S.KM, MKM, outlined that there was a collaboration with the City Government of Medan and Medan State University related to health check activities and foot massages. Additionally, a gathering with alumni and partners related to FKM USU will be held to obtain inputs and opinions for the development of FKM.

“Today is the peak when we give awards to the winners of each competition. My hope for FKM USU is that reaching 30 years can demonstrate maturity and adulthood,” hoped Dhani.
