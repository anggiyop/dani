"Through this activity, the collaboration between UPM and USU is also expected to be further strengthened and expanded in various fields, as stated in the Higher Education Tri Dharma," added Prof. Opim.

USU PR—Together with Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (Fasilkom-TI) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a collaboration through the "International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things in Perspective from Indonesia and Malaysia" which took place at the Digital Learning Centre Building of USU on Tuesday (May 7, 2024).

The symposium was organized in light of the thriving potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in various sectors. Vice Rector IV of USU, Prof. Dr. Drs. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., also mentioned the dynamics in the implementation of AI, making the symposium a platform for discussing perspectives between Indonesia and Malaysia to enhance the utilization of AI.

Additionally, Vice Rector IV of USU added that the event was an effort to share information regarding technological advancements, particularly the rapid strengthening of AI. Nowadays, everything in daily life has shifted to AI. Therefore, the symposium served as an information-sharing platform about the development of AI, how to utilize AI for the common good, and how to overcome challenges that arise alongside its development.

"Through this activity, the collaboration between UPM and USU is also expected to be further strengthened and expanded in various fields, as stated in the Higher Education Tri Dharma," added Prof. Opim.

To expand internationalization efforts in line with the USU Rector's program, the collaboration between UPM and USU is one of the initiatives, according to the Dean of Fasilkom USU, Dr. Maya Silvi Lydia, B.Sc., M.Sc. Apart from the symposium, there was also a student mobility program from UPM, where students spent several days attending lectures at USU. This program aimed to strengthen collaboration and promote information and cultural exchange, enhancing the relationship between USU and UPM.

"The collaboration plan has been in place for quite some time, but it is only now that it can be realized. We have also prepared for further collaboration with UPM, such as the possibility of USU students participating in mobility programs to UPM," said the Dean of Fasilkom-TI USU in an interview.

The presentations from the International Symposium will be recorded and subsequently go through a review process, leading to journal publications. Furthermore, the Dean of Fasilkom USU mentioned that further collaborative efforts, such as Joint Conferences, will enhance students' knowledge of AI and its developments.

Delivered online, the Dean of the Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology of UPM, Dato' Prof. Dr. Shamala K. Subramaniam, expressed great anticipation for further collaborations with USU to strengthen cooperation and achieve good international collaboration.

According to Prof. Dr. Rahmita Wirza O.K. Rahmat, the Chairman of the UPM-USU International Symposium, Malaysia and Indonesia have the same perspective regarding AI and IoT; the difference lies in how AI is implemented, as discussed during the symposium.

"AI and IoT greatly facilitate human work, making it faster. With this collaboration, we hope to strengthen the relationship between UPM and USU, which is important given the proximity of Malaysia and Indonesia," explained Prof. Dr. Rahmita Wirza O.K. Rahmat.
