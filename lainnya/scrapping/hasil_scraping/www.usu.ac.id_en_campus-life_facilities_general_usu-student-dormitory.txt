USU Student Dormitory

The USU Student Dormitory is a housing facility provided by Universitas Sumatera Utara for male and female students of USU. The Student Dormitory facility is prioritized for new students and students who receive Affirmation and Bidikmisi scholarships, but it is also open to temporary residents who are not USU students, such as exchange students or participants in competitions at USU. The male and female dormitories are located in separate buildings, both near the USU campus and guarded by USU security personnel for safety. The USU dormitories offer affordable fees with amenities like wardrobes and mattresses. You can register directly at the Rectorate Building or meet with the dormitory head for registration.
