In his remarks, USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., warmly welcomed the reviewers and analysts from the Directorate of Institutional and Vocational Education Resources at Kemdikbudristek. He stated that their presence is a great honor for USU and is significant in the shared effort to improve the quality of vocational education in Indonesia, particularly at USU.

 

The Rector also emphasized that the CF Vocational Program 2024 is strategically important in preparing human resources with competencies and skills that meet the workforce's needs. USU is committed to improving governance, partnerships, and the quality of learning and facilitating students in the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka program.

 

"We hope this activity provides constructive feedback on this program's progress and strengthens the existing collaborative relationships," said the USU Rector.

 

Anggun Puspita Sari Siswanto, Ph.D., a reviewer from Universitas Diponegoro, expressed appreciation for USU's achievements, as outlined in the progress report. She also stressed the importance of fostering a sense of belonging among faculty and students towards the program. She hopes the vocational program at USU can continue to be developed, offering broader opportunities for graduates.

 

“What has been achieved since the last verification becomes part of the progress report because it’s already August. There’s still time before the fiscal year ends. It’s important to see what percentage of the target has been met so far. Also, don’t hesitate to ask questions or share openly,” said Anggun.
