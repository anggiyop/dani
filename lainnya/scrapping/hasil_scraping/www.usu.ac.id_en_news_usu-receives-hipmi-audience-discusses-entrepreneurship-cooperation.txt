"Perhaps as entrepreneurs, we can share with students who have an interest or desire to become entrepreneurs. Not only are students ready to work, hopefully, they are also ready for entrepreneurship,” said Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si.

USU PR - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si received an audience from the Indonesian Young Entrepreneurs Association (HIPMI) Medan at the USU Rector's Office on Friday (02/02/2024).

Head of HIPMI Medan, Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si, revealed that USU is a university that is focusing on the field of entrepreneurship with various plans and programs, one of which is the UMKM Center, which is expected to achieve effective collaboration between USU and HIPMI in realizing these programs.

“We see that USU is one of the campuses that focuses on entrepreneurship. There are company study programs and USU programs that involve entrepreneurial activities. We see the need for cooperation. Earlier, there was also a discussion about the UMKM Center built on USU land. Hopefully in the future, we can establish good communication to be able to collaborate on all existing programs,” said Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si.

Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si stated that universities need to prepare students not only to be ready to work but also to be ready for entrepreneurship. This collaboration is expected to give birth to new entrepreneurs from students who are interested in entrepreneurship.

“Maybe as entrepreneurs, we can share with students who have an interest or desire to become entrepreneurs. Not only students who are ready to work, hopefully, they are also ready for entrepreneurship,” said Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si.

Furthermore, Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si said HIPMI will provide assistance, input, and experience aimed at helping new entrepreneurs start a business and overcome various problems that arise in it.

“There is an internship program, which may be in many HIPMI subsidiary companies. Hopefully, from there, we can learn and have the knowledge to start a business. Assistance for new entrepreneurs who may be confused about having problems in their business. We can provide input or learning,” said Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si.

Finally, Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si hopes that this collaboration can be a solution in addressing the gap between graduates and employment. Becoming an entrepreneur is considered an effective way to provide wider employment opportunities.

“Because we need students who are not only good at the world of work, but can open new jobs. Maybe starting this business can be the answer to the gap between graduates who have worked and those who have not,” hoped Ryalsyah Putra, S.E., M.Si.
