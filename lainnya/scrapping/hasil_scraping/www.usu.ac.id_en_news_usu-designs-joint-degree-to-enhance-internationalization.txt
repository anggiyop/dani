In the future, this will benefit other study programs and students as well," explained Prof. Poppy

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is designing a Joint Degree program to enhance internationalization. This was revealed during the Workshop on How to Establish Joint Degree Program (Realization of the Equity Program by the Ministry of Education and Culture 2023-USU) held by USU at the Grandhika Medan Hotel on Tuesday (12/12/2023)

The workshop featured Puji Mudiana, S.P., M.A., the Director of International Education at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) University, who delivered a presentation on "Penyelenggaran Program Double/Joint Degree di IPB University" (Implementation of Double/Joint Degree Programs at IPB University) Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., stated that this program is one of the international initiatives in the form of Joint/Double Degree cooperation. The collaboration is expected to benefit by expanding networks, especially for other study programs, and providing significant advantages for students.

"In the future, this will benefit other study programs and students as well," explained Prof. Poppy.

Puji Mudiana, S.P., M.A. explained the difference between joint and double degrees. A double degree involves different study programs with approximately 50% similar learning outcomes, making the differences more dominant. On the other hand, a joint degree seeks similarities, and the more similar, the better. Both involve different universities, and students will receive two diplomas.

"The most important thing to prepare is to find the right partners. So, it is crucial to find suitable partners, as that is the key to its implementation," Puji emphasized.

Prof. Dr. Dwi Suryanto, M.Sc., the Chairman of the Curriculum and Learning Innovation Institute, expressed hope that this plan can be implemented soon and affirmed the commitment to provide curriculum assistance to ensure agreement and alignment between partners and USU. After the planning stage, the next step is to execute the plan promptly.

Secretary of the Curriculum and Learning Innovation Institute, Ely Hayati Nasution, S.S., M. Si., added that after reaching collaboration agreements, there is a plan to conduct a specific workshop to discuss curriculum development. Their main focus is on curriculum development so that it can be well-adjusted.

"So, after today's workshop, after the collaboration is agreed upon, we will organize a specific workshop to discuss the development of the curriculum," Ely said.
