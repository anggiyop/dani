USU PR - A total of 522 Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) students will be dispatched to participate in the Kuliah Kerja Nyata Tematik (KKN-T) Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) program in 38 villages spread across 11 districts in North Sumatra Province. This release took place in the courtyard of the Rectorate Building on Tuesday, (1/10/2024).

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos. M.Si, represented by Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., reminded students to immediately adapt to local culture and respect local customs. The KKN aims to develop students' scientific competence while contributing to the development of village communities through three main pillars: human resource development, socio-economic development, and village environmental development.

 

“This opportunity is an opportunity and challenge for you to jointly develop scientific competence,” said Vice Rector I.

 

Furthermore, Vice Rector 1 hopes that this program can strengthen collaboration between USU, local governments, and the private sector in the development of science, technology, and art, and contribute to the development of rural communities.

 

“I hope that there will be further collaboration between the university and government institutions and private institutions in the province of North Sumatra, especially collaboration with the local district government which is the location of the Thematic KKN,” said Vice Rector 1.

 

In its implementation, students will be accompanied by 56 field supervisors (DPL) to run a structured program and achieve a recognition target of 10 to 20 credits. Ismayadi, S.Kep., Ns., M.Kes as the KKN-T Program Coordinator said that students and DPLs have been given briefings through zoom meetings so that they can carry out activities in the local village. This program is expected to not only benefit the community, but also provide valuable experience for students as future leaders of the nation.
