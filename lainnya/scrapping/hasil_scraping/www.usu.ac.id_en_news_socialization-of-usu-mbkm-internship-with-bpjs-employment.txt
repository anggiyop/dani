"One of the main activities is the internship program for one semester, which lasts 3-4 months according to the academic calendar," explained Dr. Edy.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has carried out the Socialization of USU Partner Internships for the Odd Semester T.A. 2024/2025 to BPJS Employment Participant Companies. Representatives from BPJS Employment Medan City and various BPJS partner companies attended the event, which took place online via Zoom Meeting on Friday ( 07/12/2024).

 

USU Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., explained about Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM). He said the MBKM program has various activities, such as Campus Teaching, Merdeka Student Exchange, Thematic KKN, Certified Internships, Independent Studies, humanitarian, and state defense activities.

 

“One of the main activities is the internship program for one semester, which lasts 3-4 months according to the academic calendar,” explained Dr. Edy.

 

In the context of the internship, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., explained that students will undergo a more structured and measurable internship, unlike the previous internship program. They will be provided with learning modules compiled through communication between BPJS partner companies and study programs at USU. In addition, students will receive guidance from mentors at the company and university.

 

“Students will undergo control and evaluation to ensure that they gain relevant insights, knowledge, and practical experience. This program also allows students to pursue broader passions and interests,” said Dr. Edy.

 

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., emphasized the importance of cooperation between USU, BPJS Employment, and partner companies to provide greater opportunities for students to join the MBKM program. With a participation target of around 6,000 students per semester, USU is committed to supporting off-campus activities for its students.

 

“I hope this event can increase collaboration and provide great benefits for USU students,” said Dr. Edy.

 

In his speech, the head of BPJS Employment Medan Kota Branch Office, Jefri Iswanto, expressed his gratitude for the synergy built between USU and BPJS Employment. He also expressed his appreciation to the BPJS-assisted companies participating in this program and hopes that this internship program can continue to grow in the future.

 

Jefri Iswanto also emphasized BPJS Ketenagakerjaan's commitment to support this program and is ready to assist in socialization with partner companies. He hopes this internship program can benefit students and help them be prepared to face the world of work with higher competence.

 

“The point is that we want to help our children who want to increase their competence before entering the world of work. We hope that the participation of our partner companies can help students develop the necessary skills,” said Mr. Jefri.
