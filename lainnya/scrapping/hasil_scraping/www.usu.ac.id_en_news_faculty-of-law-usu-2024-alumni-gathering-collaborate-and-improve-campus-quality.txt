“Tonight is a special moment where we gather to share information, contribute ideas, and explore how Faculty of Law USU can continue to develop globally,” said Prof. Fidel.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) organized the Faculty of Law USU Alumni Gathering, themed “Alumni Networks for Better Future.” It took place at Grandhika Hotel Medan on Friday (11/15/2024).

In his speech, Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp. F.E.R, emphasized the importance of the role of alumni in supporting the development of the faculty and university as a whole. According to him, solid alumni relations can support the achievements of the faculty, as well as provide a positive influence for new graduates who want to pursue careers in various industry sectors.

“Tonight is a special moment where we gather to share information, contribute ideas, and explore how Faculty of Law USU can continue to grow globally,” said Prof. Fidel.

The USU Secretary also expressed his hope that alumni can continue to contribute to improving the university's reputation at the national and international levels, in line with USU's strategic goal to achieve international recognition, including being ranked in the 500 QS World University Rankings, in the coming year.

“We hope that alumni who have occupied important positions in various companies can continue to provide a good image for this university,” he added.

In line with that, the Dean of Faculty of Law USU, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum., said that the class of 89 alumni will renovate the Moot Court courtroom in collaboration with the Faculty of Law USU Alumni Family Association (IKA) to improve campus facilities. The Dean also highlighted the low participation of alumni in the QS WUR survey, which only reached 71-79 respondents.

“Many alumni do not respond to the survey due to lack of information or worry. Through events like this, we try to remind alumni to care more,” he explained.

The Head of IKA Faculty of Law USU for the period 2022-2026, Hasrul Benny Harahap, S.H., M.Hum., said that the main purpose of this activity was to gather the alumni as well as discuss their participation in supporting the improvement of USU's ranking. The Head of IKA Faculty of Law USU also emphasized the importance of consolidation and alumni involvement to advance the campus.

“In the future, we will hold alumni events on a larger scale to strengthen relationships and support campus progress. Alumni have a strategic role in advancing the campus,” he said.

With the presence of alumni from various generations and backgrounds, this event is expected to generate innovative ideas that can be applied to advance the faculty and university, as well as strengthen the role of alumni in producing a superior generation of professionals.
