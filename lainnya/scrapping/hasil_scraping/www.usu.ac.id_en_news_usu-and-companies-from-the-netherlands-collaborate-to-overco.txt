“This is the initiation of cooperation between USU and companies from the Netherlands. Later, I want to work together for waste management at the Waterfall TPA," explained Prof. Poppy.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., received Aica Mugi Indonesia's audience to discuss the cooperation plan.

The visit took place in the Rector's Hearing Room of the USU Central Administration Building on Thursday, (09/29/2022).

Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and USU Cooperation, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Sc., Apt, explained that this company visit initiated the establishment of cooperation for waste management at the Waterfall TPA.

“This is the initiation of cooperation between USU and companies from the Netherlands. Later, I want to work together for waste management at the Waterfall TPA," Prof. Poppy explained.

Later this collaboration with Aica Mugi Indonesia will coordinate with waste management companies in Medan and involve the Environmental Engineering study program to manage waste at the Waterfall TPA.

This collaboration is still at the discussion stage, therefore WR III hopes that the collaboration between USU and Aica Mugi Indonesia can be realized by involving many stakeholders and many study programs other than Environmental Engineering.

"Hopefully the cooperation will be realized. This is still a preliminary discussion, of course, more stakeholders will be involved," he said.

Senior Vice President Environment, Social, Governanca Aica Asia Pacific Holding, Reinder Arie Meijer said that his company is ready to support this project because USU with knowledge and technology also supports activities for the environment.

Reinder Arie Meijer hopes that through this project, methane emissions can be reduced so as to create a cleaner and safer environment.

"I hope that with this project, methane emissions can be reduced, so that later there will be a cleaner and safer environment at the Falls Landfill or other landfills," Reinder said.

Reinder Arie Meijer is very pleased with the strong support from the USU Rector and USU's willingness to help implement the project and hopes that it will be successful and help the people around. (©ULC)
