The Rector of USU said that this collaboration could have an impact on the economy of many people. "So it can be used for the benefit of the community, especially the people in North Sumatra," he said.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) cooperates with the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI) to develop and utilize the land for Campus II Kwala Bekala, Deliserdang.

The form of cooperation between the two institutions was stated in the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) which was held at the USU Central Administration Bureau Building, Friday (1/14/2022).

Accompanied by Vice Rector II Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos, M.SP, Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Sc., Apt, Vice Rector IV Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul. M.Sc and Vice Rector V Ir. Luhut Sihombing, MP., USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., explained that with this collaboration, it is hoped that the campus land will be utilized by building a research window. The window is a symbol for research interests related to the use of oil palm plants.

“The storefront construction was carried out together, the land was prepared by USU which built GAPKI and several sponsors. GAPKI gave a grant to USU and the management was carried out by GAPKI," the Rector said.

The Rector of USU said that this collaboration could have an impact on the economy of many people. "So it can be used for the benefit of the community, especially the people in North Sumatra," he said.

North Sumatra GAPKI chairman Alexander Maha explained that making North Sumatra a storefront location would restore the dignity of North Sumatra as the first province in the history of oil palm plantations in Indonesia.

Alexander hopes that this activity can develop research results to create superior human resources.

“This is an execution of research that has been carried out by the education sector. So that it can be used for technology development and creating superior human resources in North Sumatra," Alexander said. (©ULC)
