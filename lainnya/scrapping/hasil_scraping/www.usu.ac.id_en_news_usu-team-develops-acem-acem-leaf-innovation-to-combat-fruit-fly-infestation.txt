The Community Service Program (PKM) is led by Dr. Eka Lestari Mahyuni, SKM, M.Kes., from the Faculty of Public Health, and includes members such as Isra Suryati, S.T., M.Si, from the Faculty of Environmental Engineering. Students from both faculties also participated in the project.

The Community Service Team of Universitas Sumatera Utara (TPM USU) has developed the acem-acem plant (Oxalis dehradunensis R.) as an innovative solution to combat fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis sp.) infestations. This initiative took place in Desa Semangat, Merdeka District, Karo Regency, on Aug. 3, 2024, as part of efforts to empower horticultural farmers and promote ecological sustainability and occupational health in the agricultural sector.

 

The Community Service Program (PKM) is led by Dr. Eka Lestari Mahyuni, SKM, M.Kes., from the Faculty of Public Health, and includes members such as Isra Suryati, S.T., M.Si, from the Faculty of Environmental Engineering. Students from both faculties also participated in the project.

 

“This is a longstanding problem in the Karo region. Fruit flies, commonly known as ‘cit-cit,’ are the primary enemy of Karo farmers, often causing significant crop losses. These flies are responsible for fruit rot and reduce the market value of agricultural products such as tomatoes, oranges, coffee, and other horticultural crops,” Eka said.

 

Eka has researched the benefits of the acem-acem plant, which has properties as an insecticide and repellent for these pests. The initiative to use acem-acem leaves (Oxalis dehradunensis R.) represents an innovative solution to address pest problems in horticultural crops.

 

Acem-acem leaves, according to Eka, are wild plants found in the mountains around the Karo region. Previously considered of no value, they have now been developed into a natural pesticide effective against fruit flies (Bactrocera dorsalis sp.).

 

Eka further explained that since 2019, her team has developed various products from acem-acem leaves, including pesticide-cleansing soap, anti-aging cream, and effervescent powder. The latest development is a natural pesticide to combat fruit flies.

 

“This program not only provides farmers with a solution to increase their crop yields, but it also offers an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical pesticides,” Eka stated.

 

The community service activities began on June 28, 2024. Dr. Eka taught the farmers in Desa Semangat how to produce plant-based pesticides from Oxalis dehradunensis R. extracts. The activities continued on August 3, 2024, with the testing of this botanical pesticide on tomato plants infested with fruit flies, followed by pesticide application.

 

Dr. Eka and her team also conducted environmental measurements, particularly of ambient air quality, using parameters such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter of 2.5 microns (PM2.5), particulate matter of 10 microns (PM10), total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), formaldehyde (HCHO), and meteorological factors like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind direction, and speed. The results showed that all air pollutant parameters were well below ambient air quality standards, proving that the use of acem-acem leaves can maintain ecological balance. Acem-acem, often considered a weed, need not be discarded but can be cultivated as a raw material for botanical pesticides.

 

According to Dr. Eka, farmers have long treated this plant as agricultural waste, often discarding it as a weed that could interfere with crop growth.

 

“Farmers have often discarded the acem-acem plant, but I believe that everything created by God has a purpose. This botanical pesticide is my fifth product, created to maintain the environmental cycle and ecology by managing agricultural waste,” Dr. Eka explained.

 

Research conducted by Dr. Eka in 2023 showed that acem-acem plants could be processed into health products and agricultural products like botanical pesticides. This utilization can increase farmers' incomes and benefit others, aligning with Dr. Eka’s preventive efforts to create healthy farmers, safe products, and a controlled environment. This is part of the health and sustainability agriculture program she initiated in 2019, focusing on the safety and health of farmers in the Karo region.

 

“This service marks the beginning of new product innovation development. In early 2021, I proved the efficacy of acem-acem as a pesticide cleanser with a hand soap gel product made from acem-acem leaf extract. In addition, the acem-acem leaf has also been developed into anti-aging cream and effervescent powder products, all while focusing on farmers' safety and health. Empowering farmers to utilize acem-acem is an ongoing development effort, not only to improve farmers' health but also to preserve the environment while developing the village,” Dr. Eka added.

 

“Desa Semangat is the second village targeted for the development of the acem-acem leaf utilization program. The more farmers use acem-acem to support agricultural management and health, the more their incomes in the Karo region will increase. This program is a concrete step in supporting local farmers and ensuring environmental sustainability. We hope this innovation inspires similar practices in other areas and provides long-term benefits to the community,” Eka concluded. (RJ)
