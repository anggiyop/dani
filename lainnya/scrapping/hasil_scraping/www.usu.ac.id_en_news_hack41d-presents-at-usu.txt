According to the Head of BPRI USU, our hope for this activity is that participants will learn how to solve community problems. To achieve this, they are presented with a specific case related to Telkom, which they can then solve with the guidance of their mentors. Through this process, they will develop problem-solving skills while also fostering teamwork and collaboration.

HUMAS USU - The Hack41D program took place at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) on Saturday, June 27, 2023, in the Multipurpose Hall of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP). Hack4ID is a Hackathon program that forms part of the National Movement of 1000 digital startups initiated by the Ministry of Communication and Information. It serves as a supporting program during the implementation stage of the main program.

This program aims to foster collaboration among industry players to nurture prospective startup founders and develop digital innovations that can effectively address industrial challenges.

Buchari, S.T., M.Kes, the Head of USU's Research and Innovation Development Agency, commended the Hack4ID program as a valuable initiative by Kominfo. He expressed the hope that through this program, participants would generate diverse innovative ideas in the realm of digital business.

"Our goal with this program is for participants to acquire problem-solving skills and tackle real societal issues. By presenting them with specific cases, particularly those related to Telkom, and providing mentorship, we encourage them to develop their problem-solving abilities and emphasize the importance of teamwork," he explained.

Buchari also stressed the significance of students understanding the transition from a traditional economy to the current borderless digital economy. Furthermore, he expressed his desire for participants to establish digital-based businesses in the future.

Denny, the Regional Operations Manager, identified the current global challenges as the toughest hurdle.

"The most challenging aspect lies in truly comprehending the problem. While we may acknowledge its existence, understanding it at its core is the biggest challenge," he elaborated.

To facilitate problem-solving and encourage collaborations with industry players in Indonesia, the program incorporates the principles of the Design Thinking method. This approach enables participants to create effective solutions for the industry's challenges while fostering valuable partnerships.
