“In principle, we support the Grab Indonesia to participate together with us to provide good service to the academic community. We are currently planning an open space for pedestrians and cyclists. It feels like this program can be synchronized with the Grab program," the Vice Rector V said.

USU PUBLIC RELATIONS – The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is collaborating with Grab Indonesia to expand its industrial network. The collaboration was realized by widening the scope of cooperation that had previously been agreed upon through the MoU.

At the Monday meeting (10/4) in the IMT-GT Room, USU Central Administration Bureau, representing USU Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt, Vice Rector V Ir. Luhut Sihombing, MP, Head of the Asset and Business Bureau, Head of the Bureau of Research, Community Service, and Cooperation, Expert Staff, and Education Personnel. Meanwhile, Grab Indonesia was represented by Assistant Manager Bussiness Development Medan TM Saddam, Account Support Specialist Business Development Medan Bunga Nabilah, and Sales Support Coordinator Bussiness Development Ditha Ardini Siregar.

Luhut Sihombing said that USU was ready to collaborate with Grab Indonesia to provide the best service for the USU academic community. In charge of asset and business management, Luhut said that Grab Indonesia could help with facilities and increase USU income.

“In principle, we support Grab Indonesia to participate together with us to provide good service to the academic community. We are currently planning an open space for pedestrians and cyclists. It feels like this program can be synchronized with the Grab program," Luhut said.

In response to this, Grab Indonesia, as stated by Saddam, has prepared at least four cooperation sectors. He conveyed this as a form of Grab Indonesia's commitment to support universities in carrying out activities.

"We have prepared at least four cooperation sectors between Grab Indonesia and USU. We hope that we can agree on these four programs soon so that we from Grab Indonesia can also immediately prepare their needs," said Saddam.

The four work programs in the facility sector consist of facilities that will be prepared in the form of Grab Shelters and Grab Wheel Shelters for the convenience of student transportation. In addition, there is also a Digital Payment Support program to assist with payment administration matters within USU. Grab Indonesia also offers efforts to increase the socialization of buying domestic products through the Government Goods and Services Procurement Policy Institute (LKPP) portal, as well as partnership programs.

Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa thanked Grab Indonesia for choosing USU as its partner. He explained that currently USU is trying to attract various companies to cooperate with USU. He also said that he was ready to distribute competent human resources.

"We will be able to prepare human resources both from lecturers and students to collaborate with Grab Indonesia, which of course fits the criteria. This is also important as the implementation of the Independent Learning-Free Campus," said Poppy.(©ULC)
