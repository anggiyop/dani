USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) accepted 2,889 new students for the 2021/2022 academic year from the Independent Student Selection (SMM) route whose exams were held on July 4-9, 2021. The announcement of the names of the SMM participants who passed was published on the page http://pengumuman.usu.ac.id/smm2021, Saturday (7/17/2021) night.

This was explained by USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., through the Head of the USU Public Relations, Protocol and Promotion Office,Amalia Meutia, M.Psi, Psychologist, to the media, Sunday (7/18/2021).

The Rector added that the 2,889 students who passed were part of the 8,999 SMM participants who took part in the selection this year, consisting of 4,654 participants in the Science exam group, 3498 participants in the Social Studies exam group and 847 participants in the IPC (Mix Science and Social Science) exam group. The results of the Diploma Program Student Admissions Selection (SPMPD) will be announced on July 22, 2021. SPMPD is the last route that can be used by SMA/SMK (Senior High School/Senior Vocational School) alumni to become USU students in the 2021/2022 Academic Year whose lectures’ process will begin in August.

Separately, USU's Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH., MA., also said that in 2021 the study program that was the favorite of the examinees was still relatively the same as in previous years. For the science examination groups, the favorite study programs are Public Health Sciences (1,458), Medical Education (1,310) and Information Technology (1,230). While the Social Studies exam group, the favorite study programs are Law (2,138), Management (1,767) and Psychology (1,134).

Considering the Covid-19 pandemic situation which has not yet subsided and referring to government policies that have not given the green light for face-to-face lectures, USU also cannot confirm when the offline/face-to-face lectures will be held. "For the time being, because the situation is not yet conducive, and in line with the policies issued by the North Sumatra Provincial Government, we will still apply online lectures. However, if the policy changes and the government has allowed face-to-face lectures, USU is ready to implement it," the Rector said.

USU Public Relations Head Amalia Meutia added that SMM participants who have passed can register and submit files online from 19 to 23 July 2021, via the http://registrasi.usu.ac.id page. Meanwhile, for sending registration files via post, also on the same date, 19 to 23 July 2021 and addressed to the Academic Bureau of the University of North Sumatra, Jl. Dr. T. Mansur, No. 9, Medan.

Amalia appealed to all SMM participants who have passed to read and pay close attention to all registration procedures contained on the http://registrasi.usu.ac.id page. "We hope that all SMM participants who pass can adhere to the entire schedule listed properly. Don't be late because it will affect the graduation of the participant concerned in which the status of the pass can be cancelled," Amalia concluded. (YH-©ULC)
