"Establishing this Investment Gallery took almost two years. We hope that this gallery will provide students with practical experience, not just theory," said Dr. Isfenti.

 

USU PR—The Vocational School of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) inaugurated the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) Investment Gallery, marking the beginning of the second-anniversary celebration of the USU Vocational School. The inauguration was attended by officials from the Financial Services Authority (OJK), IDX North Sumatra, and PT Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia. The event took place in the USU Vocational School Auditorium on Tuesday, July 23, 2024.

 

The Dean of the USU Vocational School, Prof. Dr. Isfenti Sadalia, S.E., M.E., stated that the investment gallery will primarily serve the Banking and Finance Study Program. However, it will also be accessible to students from other programs such as Informatics Engineering, Analytical Chemistry, and Tourism.

 

"Establishing this Investment Gallery took almost two years. We hope that this gallery will provide students with practical experience, not just theory," said Dr. Isfenti.

 

The investment gallery is one of the teaching factories aimed at providing students with practical skills, particularly in the fields of capital markets and finance. Prof. Dr. Isfenti Sadalia expressed hope that students of the USU Vocational School would not only understand theory but also be able to apply their knowledge in real-world situations.

 

"We ask for support from OJK, IDX, and PT Mirae Asset to help shape graduates who are competent in hard and soft skills. This is a great start for all of us," said Dr. Isfenti.

 

Tomi Taufan, Director of PT Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia, explained that the Investment Gallery is part of a larger program called the Academic Support and Development Program by PT Mirae Asset. The gallery will host guest lectures and Eureka Universe events to provide a deeper understanding of the capital market.

 

"We hope that students can collaborate, exchange ideas, and develop creativity in the Investment Gallery, especially in economics and capital markets," said Tomi.

 

Nur Hanjantie, Senior Vice President of Regional Development Area 1, explained that establishing the Investment Gallery at USU's Vocational School aims to develop students' competencies in understanding the capital market in theory and practice. The IDX is highly focused on developing capital market education across academic institutions in Indonesia.

 

"There are continuous programs that we will synergize with our partners in establishing this Investment Gallery," said Nur.

 

The head of the IDX North Sumatra Representative Office, M. Pintor Nasution, explained that the Indonesia Stock Exchange has a movement called "Aku Investor Saham," which aims to introduce the idea that anyone, including students from various backgrounds, can become an investor.

 

"Our movement is about showing that anyone can be an investor. Whether they are students or from any other background, everyone can become an investor," he said.
