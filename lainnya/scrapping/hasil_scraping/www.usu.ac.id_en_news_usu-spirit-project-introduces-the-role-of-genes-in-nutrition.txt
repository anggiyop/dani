The hospitals involved are Haji Adam Malik Hospital Medan and Prof Hospital Chairuddin P Lubis, as a teaching hospital.

Apart from that, nutritional associations are also involved, namely the Association of Clinical Nutritionists (PDGKI) and the Association of Medical Nutritionists (PDGMI). This topic is very interesting because nutrition has a dominant role and identifies nutritional responses to disease conditions. Apart from that, physical activity can be influenced by genes, both in performance in sports and endurance in physical activity.
