Researchers from Universitas Sumatera Utara reveal the potential of modified jackfruit starch with enhanced thermal stability and functional properties. This starch holds great promise for applications in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and eco-friendly product industries.

Jackfruit, a tropical fruit commonly found in markets, turns out to have greater potential than merely being consumed as a snack or used in sweet dishes. In addition to its distinctive sweet flavor and chewy texture, jackfruit is rich in essential nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and iron. It also contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, as well as nine essential amino acids beneficial to the body. However, despite these health benefits, jackfruit has a relatively short shelf life, which makes it prone to spoilage if not consumed promptly.

 

To address this issue, researchers from Universitas Sumatera Utara—Cut Fatimah Zuhra, M. Zulham Efendi Sinaga, Suharman, and Petra Josua Situmorang—proposed a solution by processing jackfruit into flour or starch. This form not only serves the food industry as a thickening or binding agent but also holds significant potential in pharmaceutical products and biodegradable materials.

 

However, like starch derived from many other plant sources, native jackfruit starch has limitations in terms of its functional properties. It cannot perform well under high temperatures or extreme acidic or alkaline conditions, which are often required in many industrial applications.

“Jackfruit starch is still inadequate for industrial applications that demand resistance to extreme temperature and humidity changes. Therefore, research on modifying jackfruit starch was conducted to improve its functional properties and make it more effective for various industrial applications,” explained Cut Fatimah Zuhra.

 

The researchers modified jackfruit starch using two main methods: oxidation and cross-linking. These modification processes successfully produced starch with significantly improved characteristics compared to the native form, particularly in terms of thermal stability, heat resistance, and thickening capacity. The first method, oxidation, was carried out using sodium periodate (NaIO4), a chemical agent that transforms the starch into dialdehyde starch. In this process, sodium periodate targets specific chemical bonds in the starch molecules, altering their structure and forming aldehyde groups. The oxidized starch is then further treated with cross-linking agents such as trisodium trimetaphosphate or citric acid.

 

Following these modifications, the researchers observed that the jackfruit starch exhibited superior properties compared to the unmodified version. The oxidation altered its molecular structure, producing aldehyde groups beneficial for industrial applications. Meanwhile, the cross-linking process increased the starch’s stability, enhanced its resistance to high temperatures, and improved its solubility in hot water. These improvements not only enhanced the starch’s quality but also made it more efficient for food processing, where raw materials often need to withstand high heat and humidity.

 

To confirm the success of the modification and to evaluate the physical and chemical changes in the starch, the researchers conducted various analyses.“One of the analyses used was FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), which showed that the starch modified through oxidation and cross-linking exhibited new functional groups, such as aldehyde groups resulting from the oxidation process. These changes provide evidence that the starch underwent significant modification that enhanced its quality,” said Cut Fatimah Zuhra.

 

Additionally, SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis was used to examine the starch's morphology. The results indicated that native jackfruit starch had smooth, globular granules, while the modified starch had more irregular, rough, and porous granules. This transformation suggests that the modified starch has improved water absorption capacity, a desirable trait for various industrial applications.

 

The modification process also affected the starch’s thermal properties. DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) analysis revealed that the modified starch had a lower melting point compared to the native version. This is advantageous, as it can help conserve energy in food processing, particularly for products requiring high-temperature cooking. Moreover, the enhanced thermal stability of the modified starch makes it more suitable for use in products like sauces, soups, and other items that rely on thickening or binding agents.

 

“The key benefit of modified jackfruit starch lies in its improved stability under various processing conditions. Starch modified with trisodium trimetaphosphate or citric acid exhibits better resistance to high temperatures and humidity. With these properties, modified jackfruit starch can be applied in a wide range of food industry products, such as sauces, soups, and other foods that require thickening or binding agents,” explained Cut Fatimah Zuhra.

 

Furthermore, the newly acquired properties of modified starch also open new opportunities in the pharmaceutical field. It can serve as a binder in tablet formulation and as a coating agent for pharmaceutical products requiring environmentally friendly materials. Similarly, in the cosmetics industry, modified jackfruit starch can be used as a natural and safer base ingredient in beauty products.

 

This innovation also contributes to environmental sustainability. As awareness grows regarding the importance of sustainability in industry, the use of renewable, plant-based materials such as jackfruit starch offers an eco-friendly solution. Modifying jackfruit starch not only improves product quality but also helps reduce agricultural waste by utilizing fruit that might otherwise be discarded. As such, jackfruit starch presents a more sustainable alternative compared to starch from crops that require greater resource input for production.

 

Moreover, this modification process enables the production of biodegradable materials, offering alternatives to plastic and other harmful chemicals. This represents a significant step toward more environmentally friendly and sustainable industries, aligning with the global trend of adopting natural materials and reducing dependency on synthetic substances.
