USU Faculty of Forestry Dean Dr. Rudi Hartono, along with all vice deans, led and participated in the planting activity. In his remarks, the dean expressed his gratitude to Kaka Slank and all members of the Vespa communities.

 

Together with Kaka Slank and members of various Vespa communities such as KBSS, Elders, and the Electric Vespa Community, the academic community of the Faculty of Forestry at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a greening activity at the USU Bekala campus on Monday, July 22, 2024.

 

The nationwide greening activity was initiated and led by Kaka Slank and supported by the Minister of Forestry and Environment, Siti Nurbaya. The planting of multipurpose tree species (MPTS) at the USU Bekala campus was supported by BP DAS Wampu-Ular and by.U Telkomsel. High-quality tree seedlings such as grafted avocado and durian were planted around the Faculty of Forestry campus building.

 

USU Faculty of Forestry Dean Dr. Rudi Hartono, along with all vice deans, led and participated in the planting activity. In his remarks, the dean expressed his gratitude to Kaka Slank and all members of the Vespa communities. He explained that the MPTS trees were selected to provide broad benefits to the academic community and surrounding society, including fruits, a cooler microclimate, and potentially valuable timber if needed. Meanwhile, as he planted, Kaka Slank prayed and hoped that the plants would be well-maintained and grow prosperously to provide widespread benefits.

 

Kaka Slank even took the opportunity to educate participants by sharing his recent interest in planting various types of plants and trees. He shared his personal experience that planting trees brings hope and joy, resulting in a positive psychological effect. Kaka owns a fairly large plantation. He also expressed his happiness in nurturing trees, comparing it to caring for children who need love to eventually provide extensive benefits to their surroundings. While educating, Kaka also expressed his hope that the planted seedlings would grow well and provide widespread benefits in the future.

 

The Faculty of Forestry at USU warmly welcomed Kaka Slank and several Vespa communities, including KBSS, Elders, and the Electric Vespa Community. This visit by the lead singer of the legendary band was the first in history and brought particular joy to the academic community of the USU Faculty of Forestry. The visit by the singer of "Terlalu Manis" aimed to carry out tree planting around the USU Forestry campus area as a form of pro-conservation support.

 

As known, Om Kaka, as he is affectionately called, is an avid conservationist, particularly in coral reef preservation. Additionally, Om Kaka and other Slank members have served as Yaki Ambassadors to support the conservation of the Yaki (Macaca nigra) population, which has drastically declined in recent years. In several of his concerts, he has also included messages and calls to preserve the environment as a form of concern for ecosystem sustainability. This rock and roll band has also held several charity concerts to support nature and environmental conservation on four islands in North Sulawesi.

 

The scorching sun did not dampen the spirits of Kaka Slank and the guests who attended to plant the superior seedlings that had been prepared. Along with the Dean of the Faculty of Forestry at USU, Dr. Rudi Hartono, S.Hut., M.Si., Vice Dean I, Dr. Alfan Gunawan Ahmad, S.Hut., M.Si., Vice Dean II, Dr. Pindi Patana, S.Hut., M.Sc., Vice Dean III, Prof. Dr. Agus Purwoko, S.Hut,. M.Si., and the entire academic community of the Faculty of Forestry at USU, Kaka Slank, and the attending guests planted superior seedlings in the prepared holes. The seedlings included MPTS trees such as avocado, guava, durian, and mango grafts. The use of grafted MPTS seedlings aims to increase fruit production and shorten the growing period to reach the mature tree phase.

 

After planting the seedlings, the event continued with a group photo with a collection of legendary Vespa motorcycles that had been converted into more environmentally friendly electric motorcycles. The event concluded with a relaxed discussion and chanting together in the Faculty of Forestry's garden.
