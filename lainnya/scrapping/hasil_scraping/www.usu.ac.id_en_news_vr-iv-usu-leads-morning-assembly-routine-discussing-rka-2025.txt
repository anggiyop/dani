“In carrying out various activities that have been written in each RKA, we should all adhere to the principles of prudence and financial efficiency,” Prof. Opim said in his mandate.

 

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a morning assembly routine activity, led by USU Vice Rector IV, Prof. Dr. Drs. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc and attended by the entire academic community at the USU Rector's Bureau Ground on Monday (03/02/2025).

 

On this occasion, USU Vice Rector IV emphasized the importance of prudence and financial efficiency in carrying out the 2025 Activity and Budget Plan (RKA).

 

“In carrying out various activities that have been written in each RKA, we should all adhere to the principles of prudence and financial efficiency,” Prof. Opim said in his mandate.

 

He reminded that the challenges in implementing priority programs are getting bigger, both from the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemdiktisaintek RI) and USU Rector's priority programs.

 

In addition, VR IV USU appreciated the hard work of the entire USU academic community, which achieved an average RKA performance of 84.79% in 2024.

 

“I would also like to thank all of you who have worked hard throughout 2024,” he added.

 

USU also continues to develop an Enterprise Resource Planning-based information system (ERP-USU).

 

USU's achievements in the Government Agency Accountability Report (LAKIP) this morning were also highlighted. After obtaining the A predicate in 2023, USU improved to the AA predicate in 2024.

 

At the end, USU Vice Rector IV invited all USU staff to continue to innovate and work together to face challenges in 2025 and realize better and higher-quality education.
