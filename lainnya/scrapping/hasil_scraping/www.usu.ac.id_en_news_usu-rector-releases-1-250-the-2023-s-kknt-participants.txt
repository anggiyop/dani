This is an opportunity and challenge for you to jointly develop scientific competence, demonstrate your role and responsibility and contribute to development, especially for people in rural areas, "said Prof. Mury

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a symbolic release of 1,250 students of the Community Service-Thematic Program (KKN-T) of Universitas Sumatera Utara in 2023. The release was carried out by USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, at the USU Rector Bureau on Thursday (13/07/2023).

The USU Rector said that KKN-T aims to prepare students of Universitas Sumatera Utara to become graduates with the capacity as true learners who are competent, flexible, and resilient (agile learners).

"This is an opportunity and challenge for you to jointly develop scientific competence, as well as demonstrate your role and responsibility and contribute to development, especially for people in rural areas," he continued.

This year's KKNT participants come from the Faculty of Law, Faculty of Agriculture, and Faculty of Cultural Sciences, located in 8 districts spread across 73 villages. The departure of Regular KKN-T participants began on Monday, July 17 to July 21, then the release of National KKN participants on July 19, and International KKN on July 20, 2023.

The Rector advised that students participating in the USU KKNT can learn in the village enthusiastically, be responsible, take care of themselves, and maintain the good name of the alma mater and not harm themselves and others.

"Uphold the ethics of courtesy in the local area and do not commit acts that can harm yourself and others. Be smart and wise in using social media and communicating so there is no misunderstanding with the local village community. Don't forget to maintain health and safety," he explained.

Dr. Zulfan Lubis, S.S., M.Hum, as Chairperson of KKN-T PPM USU, hopes that participants can contribute solutions or innovations to village communities by upholding the ethics and manners of local wisdom in each village.

KKN-T Regular Coordinator Eko Yudhistira SH, M.Kn said what needs to be addressed is how to have manners when coming to someone else's village and how to mingle with the village community so that it can be well received.

Social security will be given to all students who carry out KKN-T as a form of state presence to protect the nation's next generation. Andi Widya Leksana conveyed this as the head of the Tanjung Morawa Social Security Organizing Agency (BPJS) office.
