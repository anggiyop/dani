"One way to overcome this is from an early age, children must be familiarized with computational thinking, which is now commonplace in developed countries," said Baihaqi.

USU PR - USU lecturers contributed their thoughts in a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) event that discussed the main principles of State Policy related to Socio-Cultural Affairs. The USU lecturers are Dr. Fotarisman Zaluchu, S.K.M., M.P.H from FISIP and Baihaqi Siregar S.Si., MT from Fasilkom-TI.

In the FGD which was held at the Hotel Santika Premiere Dyandra, Medan, Monday (12/27/2021), Baihaqi Siregar said, it was necessary to anticipate the demographic bonus so that it would not become a demographic disaster.

The current generation must be prepared for its capabilities in accordance with future work needs. Moreover, there is the issue of automation that can erode incompetent human resources.

"One way to overcome this is from an early age, children must be familiarized with computational thinking, which is now commonplace in developed countries," he said.

According to Baihaqi, the use of data that is integrated and not redundant needs to start from the lowest level in society (kelurahan, neighborhood) and be bottom-up, not top-down as it is today.

"So that the decisions made by the government feel that they can directly meet the needs of the community," he continued.

He added that sustainable research will also produce innovations that can become commercial goods, require large costs and take a long time to focus on research objectives.

“For example, in Switzerland, which is country no. 1 in the Global Innovation Index 2021, able to issue a value of 60M for 1 research proposal. Singapore prepares Rp. 3,000T funds for innovation," said Baihaqi.

For information, this FGD activity is intended to explore more deeply about the development of the social and cultural fields in achieving the Vision and Mission of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia as stated in the preamble to the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia.

"The results of this FGD become a recommendation for the MPR Review Board regarding the direction of social and cultural development policies in the Main Principles of State Policy," said Baihaqi. (©ULC)
