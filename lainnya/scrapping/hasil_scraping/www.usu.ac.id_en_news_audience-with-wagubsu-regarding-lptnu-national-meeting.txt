"This is a good thing for us by introducing North Sumatra, especially Medan City, from all the potential in it," stated the Deputy Governor.

USU PR- Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., Rector of Universitas Sumatra Utara (USU), attended an audience with the Deputy Governor of North Sumatra, H. Musa Rajekshah, S.Sos., M.Hum., to review the preparations for the National Working Conference (Rakernas) of the Nahdlatul Ulama Higher Education Institute (LPTNU), held at the North Sumatra Deputy Governor's Office on Monday (20/02/2023)

This year, Medan will host the LPTNU RAKERNAS in March. North Sumatra's Deputy Governor stated that the LPTNU RAKERNAS event might introduce the potential of North Sumatra.

"This is a good thing for us by introducing North Sumatra, especially Medan City, from all the potential in it," stated the Deputy Governor.

According to the Deputy Governor of North Sumatra, not only must the Rakernas preparations be completed, the NU organization itself needs to be improved, given that NU is celebrating its centennial this year. This organizational improvement affects the institutions within it, one of which is LPTNU.

"The Nahdlatul Ulama organization, which has entered its 100th year, can continue to improve and reform the organization and its institutions, including the Nahdlatul Ulama higher education institution, LPTNU. LPTNU may develop regulations and enhance higher education to help build the human resources of those who attend universities, "added he.

Meanwhile, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., USU Rector, reported that 70% of the preparations for the LPTNU National Conference had been completed. The Rector announced that K. H. Ma'ruf Amin, the Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia, the Minister of Education and Research, the Ministry of Religion, the Chairman of PBNU, the Director General of Diktiristek, and the Director General of Pendis would all be present at a nationwide seminar (Ministry of Religion).

"Rakernas LPTNU is a nationwide activity administered by LPTNU under the supervision of PBNU for which preparations have reached 70%. God willing, the Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia, the Minister of Education and Research, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the Chairman of PBNU, the Director General of Diktiristek, and the Director General of Pendis (Ministry of Religion) will attend a national seminar program later on "said Muryanto Amin.

According to the Rector, hosting the LPTNU Rakernas could improve education not just in Java but also in Sumatra. (Bambang Riyanto).
