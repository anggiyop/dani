Now the required competency is focus. People have to be focused because this habit of procrastination is what makes us unfocused. Distracted. So we have to develop the competency of focus and then be able to control our cognition so that we can devote our attention," he explained.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the University of Indonesia (UI) collaborated in organizing a Guest Lecture with the theme "Opportunities and Challenges for Companies in the Era of Global Economic Globalization from the Perspectives of Business and Law." The event occurred at the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall on Tuesday (10/10/2023).

In his remarks, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum., Dean of the Faculty of Law, said that in the era of globalization, humanity is experiencing a period of disruption. The world community is experiencing an industrial revolution, an information technology revolution, and a pandemic that impacts their behavior patterns.

"And it all results in the emergence of a new perspective, a new way of life, and affects how we live our lives," he said.

This guest lecture invited Prof. Rhenald Kasali, Ph.D., an academic and practitioner, and a professor at the University of Indonesia. Prof. Rhenald also explained the development, changes, and competencies that young people, especially students, must have.

Now the required competency is focus. People have to be focused because this habit of procrastination is what makes us unfocused. Distracted. So we have to develop the competency of focus and then be able to control our cognition so that we can devote our attention," he explained.

Furthermore, Prof. Rhenald also added that students must be prepared for the future. The role of the professors is not merely to deliver the entire course material; rather, they should provide students with the opportunity to seek information themselves.

"Professors can present questions a week prior or provide imaginative questions, allowing students to think, present, and explain," he added
