In his remarks, the Rector said that the inauguration was not just a mere ceremonial but a matter that has serious consequences for humans, the universe, and responsibility to God Almighty.

PR USU - Rector of the Unversitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Sc., officially inaugurated Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., MSP becomes the Dean of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences for the period 2021-2025. The event was held at the Multipurpose Hall Building, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) USU, on Tuesday (7/26/2022).

In his remarks, the Rector said that the inauguration was not just a mere ceremonial but a matter that has serious consequences for humans, the universe, and responsibility to God Almighty.

“This inauguration is not just a mere ceremonial. But what we have heard together has very serious consequences,” said the Rector.

According to the Rector, the oath of office has meaning for each person's life, especially in carrying out the mandate to carry out noble tasks for the advancement of education at USU and Indonesia.

"The oath of office has meaning for the lives of each carrying out the mandate to carry out noble tasks for the advancement of education at USU and also in Indonesia," the Rector said.

The USU Rector advised the newly inaugurated FISIP Dean that all priority programs that had been set could be implemented and then monitored for a better FISIP.

In addition, there are many challenges faced by FISIP so that the Rector hopes that the academic community can improve their performance such as having a lot of writings and international networks.

"FISIP surely has many challenges, because for social scientists the distance is still slow, so this is extra effort and work so that lecturers can perform better, write more," he said.

On the same occasion, the Dean of FISIP Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., MSP., said that FISIP will be guided by USU's vision and mission and then jointly achieve the 500 World Class University target.

"We are guided by USU vision and mission and then the performance contract that we have agreed with the Rector and also work together to achieve academic reputation," said the Dean of FISIP.

Dr. Hatta Ridho hopes to complete all the Strategic Plans that have been made in 2020 so as to increase USU's achievements, especially the achievement of FISIP.

"We can complete all the annual Strategic Plan work that we made in 2020 so that later together we can improve the achievements of USU, especially FISIP," he said. (©ULC)
