Inter Coffee

Inter Coffee USU is a new cafe launched in August 2021 alongside the International Guesthouse at the Universitas Sumatera Utara. Originally intended to cater to guests at the International Guesthouse, the cafe is now open to the public, not just USU students. With an aesthetically pleasing outdoor cafe space and a fabulous indoor space with glass walls, Inter Coffee USU offers a diverse menu of food and beverages, including coffee, fresh juices, and dishes such as fried rice and french fries. The spacious space and soothing ambience, with a blue pool connected to the sunlight, attract students and non-students who wish to enjoy the cafe well into the evening.
