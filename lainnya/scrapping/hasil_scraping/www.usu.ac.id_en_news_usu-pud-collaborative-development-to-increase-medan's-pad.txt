The Rector explained that USU will provide assistance by a team of experts on priority programs that have been designed by the Development PUD.

"USU will provide a team of experts who will provide input and suggestions for the PD Pembangunan program," said Muryanto.

Not only that, USU will also help the Development PUD to recruit potential human resources. "For the selection of HR, we will first examine the direction of the company and examine the readiness of HR so that it can be a solution for the Development PUD,"

The President Director of the Medan City Development PUD Gerald P. Siahaan, S.H, S.E, M.M., his party will cooperate with USU to carry out developmental matters, especially in the technical and regional management fields.

“The next step that we will take together with USU is to have a coffee morning, hold an informal meeting. Until later, we will discuss the form of cooperation in terms of designing the PUD," said Gerald.

He hopes that every regional and non-regional company will seek advice from academics in supporting the program. (©ULC)
