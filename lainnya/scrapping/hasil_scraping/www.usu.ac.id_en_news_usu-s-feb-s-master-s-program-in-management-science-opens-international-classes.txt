Field evaluation is the beginning point for enhancing the teaching and learning process. Ensuring that SPMI, for example, is adopted and implemented. Together with our two assessors, we will spend the next two days laying the groundwork for an improved state.

USU PR - In support of the university's internationalization program, as reiterated by USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin, the USU FEB Master's Program in Management Science has accepted two students from China.

Monday (22/05/2023), the Self-Accreditation Institute for Economics, Management, Business, and Accounting (LAMEMBA) conducted a field assessment of the Master of Management Science Study Program at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). 

Prof. Dr. Aurik Gustomo, ST, MT, from the Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), and Dr. Aris Budi Setyawan, SE, MM, from Universitas Gunadarma, participated in the activity as LAMEMBA assessors.

Dr. Fadli SE., M.Si., dean of USU's FEB, stated that in the past two years, USU, particularly FEB, has looked into obtaining international accreditation from FIBAA. This accreditation procedure is anticipated to facilitate the attainment of additional international accreditation from AACSB. It is known that LAMEMBA and AACSB have signed a memorandum of understanding.

"USU, specifically FEB, has been exploring FIBAA international accreditation for nearly two years. A memorandum of understanding has been established with AACSB, as is common knowledge. So that the provision of the accreditation process will become an asset in the future."

EB USU has established international-scale cooperation marked by holding international classes in Undergraduate, Masters, and Doctoral study programs. Following this, the USU's FEB Master's Program in Management Science announced that it would admit two Chinese students.

The objective of the field evaluation is to conduct examinations and observations as part of the study program accreditation procedure. The LAMEMBA assessor team spent two days conducting a field evaluation of the USU FEB's Master's Program in Management Science.

Previously, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, USU Vice-Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, stated that the field assessment is the first stage in improving the learning process and ensuring that the Internal Quality Assurance System (SPMI) is truly implemented and executed.

Prof. Dr. Aurik Gustomo, ST, MT, a LAMEMBA assessor, revealed the criteria for accreditation assessment, including the Vision, Mission, Goals, and Strategies (VMTS), Tri Dharma, namely education, research, and community service, supporting aspects such as the quality and quantity of human resources, facilities, finances, and an important evaluation, namely the LAMEMBA international competitiveness standard.

"The most crucial aspect relates to VMTS as the initial standard for LAMEMBA accreditation. "The ones below discuss the Tri Dharma domain, beginning with education, research, and community service," said Professor Aurik.

"Field evaluation is the starting point for enhancing the instruction and learning process. Ensuring that SPMI, for example, is adopted and implemented. Therefore, we will spend the next two days with our two assessors laying the groundwork for an improved state."
