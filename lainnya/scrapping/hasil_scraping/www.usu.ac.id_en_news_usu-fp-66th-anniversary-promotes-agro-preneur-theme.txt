"All university leaders, in this case, the Rector, of course really appreciate all of FP's achievements. We heard about a number of things that could increase USU's ranking, especially those produced by FP," Prof. Fidel said.

USU Public Relations - Commemorating the 66th Anniversary of the Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an open session, Friday (11/18/2022) in the Suratman Hall.

The USU FP's 66th Anniversary Celebration carries the theme "Acceleration of Agro Preneur Bachelor of Agriculture for Sustainable Food". Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp.F.E.R responded positively to all the developments and achievements of FP in the last 66 years which support the Main Performance Index (IKU) of Higher Education.

"All university leaders, in this case, the Rector, of course really appreciate all of FP's achievements. We heard about a number of things that could increase USU's ranking, especially those produced by FP," Prof. Fidel said.

According to the Secretary of the University, the theme raised at the celebration of the 66th Anniversary was the right moment for USU's Faculty of Agriculture to increase the number of graduates interested in the agroporener profession. University leaders will always encourage USU FP so that it can be on par with FPs from other leading BH PTNs.

"FP is one of the oldest faculties at USU which is 66 years old. Thus, FP has achieved a lot of progress. In the future, the KPI has been achieved by USU," he said.

Dean of USU's Faculty of Agriculture Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana, M.S in his report stated that 3 of the 6 Study Programs in USU's FP had excellent accreditation.

According to the Dean of USU FP, this faculty has experienced rapid development and is still trying to become the best faculty at USU. After this, by involving alumni assistance, USU's FP will prepare to achieve international accreditation in 2023 as one of USU's supporters in IKU and World Class University assessments.

"The target of FP is in line with its mission to achieve several IKUs and WCUs," the Dean of USU FP mentioned.

FP USU itself has become the first winner as the organizer of the Scopus-indexed international conference in 2022, then in the same year it became the first winner as the organizer of the SINTA-accredited USU TALENTA Journal, and has the highest number of Scopus-indexed Journal Articles as of October 31, 2022.

The initiator of the 66th Anniversary of USU FP was initiated by alumni of the 92nd batch with Albert Gusti Tanjung as chairman. On the same occasion, USU IKA FP Representative said he was pleased with the achievements of USU's FP and alumni of USU's FP who have spread on a national and international scale.

For information, there was a scientific oration at the open session of the USU FP 66thAnniversary that delivered directly by the Regent of South Tapanuli, Dolly P. Pasaribu.

In the oration, the regent conveyed several important things related to the theme raised.

He said, people must return to farming productively and efficiently because Indonesia is an agricultural country. The Regent hopes that USU's Faculty of Agriculture will prioritize entrepreneurial traits.

"My hope for FP is to be far more entrepreneurial, which means that he can see something that other people cannot see but he can try and make it useful," the Regent of South Tapanuli who is an alumni of USU FP conveyed. (©ULC)
