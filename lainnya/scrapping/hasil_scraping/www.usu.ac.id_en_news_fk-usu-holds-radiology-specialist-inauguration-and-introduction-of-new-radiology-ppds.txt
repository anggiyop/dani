“We not only give certificates but also as a symbol of the commitment of radiology practitioners who start a new journey that demands seriousness and perseverance, in line with the vision of radiology to produce doctors who are moral, qualified, community-oriented and superior global competitiveness,” explained Dr. Joiverdia.

One of the things requested by the Rector to the new Radiology Specialists is that they can continue to develop themselves into doctors who are moral, qualified, community-oriented, and globally competitive.

“We do not only give certificates but also as a symbol of the commitment of radiology practitioners who start a new journey that demands seriousness and perseverance, in line with the vision of radiology to produce doctors who are moral, qualified, community-oriented and superior global competitiveness,” explained Dr. Joiverdia.

Meanwhile, the Dean of FK USU, Prof. Dr. dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe, Sp.S (K) said, Radiology, as a newly formed Study Program in September 2018, certainly had faced several problems which over time were successfully overcome together. There was an increase in the number of graduates of FK USU Radiology Specialists and PPDS when compared to last February, responding to this, the Dean of FK USU expressed his hope that the PPDS Radiology Study Program could graduate on time, 8 semesters.

“We also understand that this is a new study program opened in September 2018, so there are several obstacles that thank God together we can face, we hope that in the future this will be even better, and we hope that all FK USU Radiology PPDS can graduate on time in 8 semesters,” said the Dean of FK USU.

In line with that, the Head of the Radiology Study Program at FK USU, dr.
