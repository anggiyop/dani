Jogging Track

The jogging track, located around the USU Auditorium and behind the USU Central Bureau of Administration building, is a place that is often used by locals and USU students after work or college in the afternoon to do sports activities. On weekends and weekdays, this track is always crowded with people who want to exercise with friends or family. The track is long and wide, so you can often see young athletes and people doing physical training here.
