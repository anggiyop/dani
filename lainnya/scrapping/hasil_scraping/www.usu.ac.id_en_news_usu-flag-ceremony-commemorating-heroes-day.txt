In line with the Hero's Day theme, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., while reading the message from the Minister of Social Affairs, Tri Rismaharini, invited the public to take action to carry out the mission of heroes to defeat the enemy, namely poverty and ignorance in a broad sense.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a flag-raising ceremony to commemorate Heroes Day with the theme "My Hero Inspiration". This commemoration ceremony was solemnly held in the courtyard of the USU Administrative Center Building, Wednesday (11/10/2021).

In line with the Hero's Day theme, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., while reading the message from the Minister of Social Affairs, Tri Rismaharini, invited the public to take action to carry out the mission of heroes to defeat the enemy, namely poverty and ignorance in a broad sense.

"We have great potential in winning the war against poverty and ignorance, because Indonesia has abundant natural resources and a strategic geographical location," said the minister as read by the Rector.

He explained, in the next 20 years, Indonesia will enter a demographic bonus, namely the period when the dependency ratio reaches a minimum. In that period, there will be more productive labor that is useful for winning the war against poverty and ignorance.

“But on the other hand, there is also a tendency to reduce job opportunities which must be anticipated. We must face this reality with an entrepreneurial spirit,” he added.

Through this Heroes' Day commemoration, the Rector said that every Indonesian citizen can become a hero in any field. "We can start by being a hero for the economy of our family and community," he said.

The Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs concluded by inviting the USU academic community to hold a moment of silence for 60 seconds simultaneously as a tribute to the services and sacrifices of the heroes.

On this occasion, the Rector also symbolically attached the Satyalencana Karya Satya honor to several USU lecturers and teaching staff who have served for 10, 20 and 30 years. (©ULC)
