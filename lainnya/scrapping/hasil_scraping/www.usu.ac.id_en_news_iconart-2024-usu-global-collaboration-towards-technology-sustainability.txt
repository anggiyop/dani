Vice Rector III underlined the importance of this conference as an intellectual interaction to encourage critical and collaborative discussions that generate innovative ideas and sustainable solutions. He hoped that participants could contribute significantly to solving pressing global challenges, especially in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

 

“The conference theme reflects our shared commitment to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,” he added.

 

The conference, which took place under the sub-theme “Resilience and Innovation Research on Sustainable Natural Resources and Technology in the 4.0 era”, became an important platform for sharing knowledge and experiences in facing the challenges of the industrial era 4.0, especially in the fields of natural resources and sustainable technology.
