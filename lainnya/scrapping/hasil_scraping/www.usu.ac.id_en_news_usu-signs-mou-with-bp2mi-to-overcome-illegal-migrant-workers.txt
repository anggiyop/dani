"The goal is to provide clarity, skills or abilities needed by foreign countries that accept workers, so that we can protect them together," said the Rector.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utrara (USU) plays a role in overcoming the problem of illegal Indonesian migrant workers, especially in North Sumatra. This was manifested in the signing of the MoU with the Indonesian Migrant Worker Protection Agency (BP2MI) at the Tengku Rizal Nurdin Hall of the Governor's Office, Wednesday (3/9/2022).

North Sumatra Governor Edy Rahmayadi said 46,000 North Sumatrans became workers who were dispatched illegally, since the Covid-19 pandemic. One way to solve this problem is to provide education to people who will work abroad.

"The goal is to provide clarity, skills or abilities needed by foreign countries that accept workers, so that we can protect them together," he said.

For this reason, Edy Rahmayadi said that his party would involve USU as an educational institution in providing education, as well as finding the right solution. According to him, every year universities create tens of thousands of graduates, but not all of them get internal jobs, so it is necessary to provide solutions for these prospective workers.

"We will discuss with the rector and the university regarding this handling," he said.

In line with that, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. said USU was asked to facilitate prospective workers who want to improve their skills and abilities. In addition, USU will also conduct a study to produce recommendations that can be given to deal with the problems of TKI (Indonesian Workers) in North Sumatra.

"The training and studies carried out will involve lecturers and students," said the Rector.

He added that this collaboration also involved the North Sumatra Province Manpower and Transmigration Office and companies related to sending workers.

"After this, the deputy or his technical staff will hold another meeting with USU to discuss what follow-up actions will be taken," said the Rector.

According to the Head of BP2MI, Benny Rhamdani, a strong commitment from all parties is needed to overcome this human trafficking problem. This can be done by ensuring a safe migration process, facilitating immigrants through adequate training, certification, and foreign language skills.

"We need to collaborate and synergize, the handling of TKI is our responsibility," he concluded. (©ULC)
