“These students are agents of change. That's why the government targets students in holding this competition so that they can transmit the spirit of mental revolution to the surrounding environment," said Prof. Poppy.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) handed out prizes to students who won the Big Ideas Competition 2021 National Mental Revolution Movement held by the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenko PMK RI). The prize was handed over directly by USU's Vice Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si, M.Si, Apt at Inter Coffe USU, Thursday (12/23/2021).

Prof. Poppy said that students are the right subjects in the effort of the National Movement for Mental Revolution. This is realized because students are aspirational connectors who are in direct contact with the community.

“These students are agents of change. That's why the government targets students in holding this competition so that they can transmit the spirit of mental revolution to the surrounding environment," said Prof. Poppy.

She also mentioned that students become agents of change because they have idealistic thoughts. Therefore, innovation and breakthroughs from students are very much needed in the efforts of the National Movement for Mental Revolution.

As is known, USU plays an active role in helping the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Culture to succeed the National Movement for Mental Revolution. USU takes a role in the field of cleanliness by carrying out various activities such as seminars and competitions with the title "Clean Indonesia Movement, Students as Agents of Change".

“I hope that in future activities there will be more ideas and innovations from students who take part in this activity. We often mention that some foreign countries are very clean, but we forget to apply it in our own country. Therefore, these students are the agents of change," Prof. Poppy concluded.

Syahma Nadita from the Agribusiness Department won first place with the title "Indonesian Free Waste with Waste Factory Application". In second place was Hosana Hotma Febriani Pasaribu from the Agribusiness Department with the title "Organic Compost Making for Better Waste Management", and Tresa Roselina Hutagalung from Environmental Engineering ranked third with the title "Automatic Takakura Bin".

Meanwhile, M Faidhil Iman from the Department of Psychology won the first hope with the title "Roof Tiles out of Plastic". Next is Kevin Darma Surya from the Department of Environmental Engineering with the title "wasterevolution.id: Educational Platform for the Indonesian Waste Management Revolution" in the second position of hope.

The third hope was achieved by Abdul Karim Manoarfa from the Department of Public Health with the title "Efforts to Reduce Waste Amid Low Awareness and Knowledge in Managing Waste".

Present at the meeting were Expert Staff Ikhsan Siregar ST., M.Eng and Dr. Rulianda Purnomo Wibowo SP., M.Ec. (©ULC)
