"This is also special because we listen to the views and experiences of the President Director of BPJS Health. His presence provides an extraordinary opportunity for all of us," said Dr. Edy.

USU PR—The Faculty of Medicine (FK) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) organized the Global Health Seminar Series Lecture on "National Health Insurance and the Direction of Its Future Development." The event was held on Wednesday (02/21/2024) in the third-floor hall of FK USU.

The activity invited the President Director of BPJS Kesehatan (Social Security Administrator for Health), Prof. Dr. Ali Ghufron Mukti, M.Sc., Ph.D., as a guest speaker. Discussions took place related to the dynamics in the development of the national health insurance system and steps to ensure that access to quality health services can be enjoyed by all levels of society.

Opening his remarks, USU Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., appreciated the implementation of the Seminar Series as proof of USU's commitment to discussing important issues in the world of health, especially regarding national health insurance.

"This is also special because we listen to the views and experiences of the President Director of BPJS Health. His presence provides an extraordinary opportunity for all of us," said Dr. Edy.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., also expressed his hope that this seminar would be a conducive discussion space for exchanging ideas, experiences, and knowledge, resulting in learning for all participants in determining future steps so that it will have a good impact on improving the health system and national welfare.

"Thank you to the Dean of the USU Faculty of Medicine and his staff. Hopefully, our collaboration today can make a meaningful contribution to improving the national health system," said Dr. Edy.

The Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Prof. Dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe Sp.S(K), stated that health insurance is the right of every Indonesian citizen, and the development of national health insurance, especially BPJS Health, has grown rapidly. This understanding creates an appreciation for the development of the health insurance system in Indonesia as well as efforts to ensure the health rights of every individual are fulfilled.

"Everyone needs health insurance; it is a basic human need," Prof. Aldy emphasized.

Prof. Dr. Ali Ghufron Mukti, M.Sc., Ph.D., said that this activity is also an example of the application of Pancasila values and the culture of gotong royong that can be felt by hundreds of millions of Indonesians through the JKN program. However, it has been realized that many still do not completely know about JKN. Therefore, this activity was held to convey JKN's urgency.

"BPJS always innovates through digitalization, including JKN. We always bring services closer to the community, so now people can take hospital queues from home," said Prof. Ali.
