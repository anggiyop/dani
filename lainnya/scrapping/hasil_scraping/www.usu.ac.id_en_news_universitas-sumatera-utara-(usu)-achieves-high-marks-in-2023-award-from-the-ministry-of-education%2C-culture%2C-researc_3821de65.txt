USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) achieved a high score in the awards conducted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology for 2023. With a Budget Performance Score (NKA) of 93.21%, USU was awarded the "Very Good" rating and secured the top position in the category of State Universities with Legal Entity status. The results were announced during the Mendikbudristek Award Ceremony at the Ki Hajar Dewantara Building, Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, Jakarta, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024.

 

In her opening remarks, Suhartini, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, expressed her appreciation to all institutions, work units, and organizational units within the Ministry for their excellent performance. She encouraged everyone to use this achievement as motivation for continued growth.

“We extend our deepest appreciation to all work units and organizational units within the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology that have supported and ensured the successful implementation of all priority programs. We urge everyone to continuously cultivate commitment and responsibility in improving performance and to consistently strive for continuous improvement,” said Suhartini.

This event is an award ceremony hosted by the Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, recognizing organizations based on their Budget Performance Scores (NKA), the implementation of the Government Agency Performance Accountability System (SAKIP), Public Information Disclosure (KIP), and Best Archival Management for the 2023 fiscal year. The awards were presented to Echelon I and II organizational units, state universities, and Technical Implementation Units (UPT) to promote accountability and budget performance improvement.

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., received the award directly from Minister Nadiem Makarim. He expressed his gratitude to his entire team, stating that the achievement was not due to individual or small group efforts but rather cross-sector collaboration.

“The transformation of performance, which has long been oriented around individualism or limited to a few individuals, has yielded results. The cultivation of collaboration values at Universitas Sumatera Utara is gradually showing positive progress. Today’s award is proof that the strength of collaboration makes us stronger and capable of fulfilling all responsibilities,” said Prof. Muryanto Amin.

Prof. Muryanto Amin urged his team to look toward 2024 with optimism. The achievement of a "Very Good" NKA rating serves as a key asset. The experience gained in managing priority programs so far is expected to provide the strength needed to reach further achievements.
