"Later, there will be an appeal for all public relations of the academic community from faculties, study programs, and so on to use this product in daily activities," said the Rector.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), together with the Development of the Prosperous Alma Mater (PAS), officially launched a number of innovative products. USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Sc. attended the launch activities, which took place at the USU Central Administration Bureau Building on Thursday (3/31/2022).

At the event, there were five innovative products released by USU, including Ina Klin, which consisted of dish soap, floor cleaner, and hand soap, which were inventoried by Prof. Dr. Ir Rosdanelli Hasibuan, MT from Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering (FT) USU. Then there is my Gold Sugar product in the form of sugar produced from natural palm sugar which is inventoried by Ir. Neyti Herlina, MT from USU's Environmental Engineering Faculty. Then there is the Hanspas hand sanitizer product, inventoried by Imam Bagus Sumantri S. Farm., MSi, Apt. The production process of a number of innovative products is also inseparable from the contribution of students.

On this occasion, the Rector said that later, all faculties and academics at USU would be encouraged to use these products in their daily activities.

"Later, there will be an appeal for all public relations of the academic community from faculties, study programs, and so on to use this product in daily activities," he said.

The Rector added that later, the marketing of several of these innovative products would target the entire community, both at the household and corporate levels.

“All these things, we will do sales to the general public and all the companies. The main target is, of course, the general public,” Dr. Muryanto Amin added.

On this occasion, the DiRector of PT PAS, Ryalsa Putra S.E., M.Si, hoped that the products created could be maintained and accepted by the market. He also hopes that by holding this event, inventors will be motivated to work with PT PAS.

"First, the hope is that the product is sustainable, accepted by the market, and also becomes a trigger for other inventors to work together with PAS," Ryalsa Putra said.

On the same occasion, Commissioner of PT PAS USU Doli Dalimunthe, S.E., M.Si also said that the launch of this innovative product is a step that USU is ready to transform into an entrepreneurial university.

"The existence of PT PAS can be the frontline party in generating entrepreneurship at USU," he added. (©ULC)
