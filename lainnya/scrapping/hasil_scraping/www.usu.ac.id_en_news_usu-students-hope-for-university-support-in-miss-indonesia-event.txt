“This is a very positive example of an USU student whose talent can be optimized, and have the confidence to be able to do something, not only for herself but also for the Universitas Sumatera Utara. We also see that she wants to build a spirit of a student who continues to move in achieving achievements," said WR I.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Faculty of Engineering student Wenda Yunita Tarigan made friends and hoped for university support through Vice Rector 1 Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H. M.A. to come forward to represent North Sumatra Province at the Miss Indonesia event which will be held on January 12, 2022 at Graha Mustika Ratu, Jakarta.

During the gathering, Monday (1/10/2022) at the USU Central Administrative Bureau Building, the Expert Staff of the Rector for Student Affairs and Alumni, Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi., Psychologists were also present.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan really appreciates the activities that Wenda Yunita Tarigan will participate in in the Miss Indonesia event and hopes to be a trigger for USU students to be enthusiastic about achieving achievements.

“This is a very positive example of an USU student whose talents can be optimized, and have the confidence to be able to do something not only for herself but also for the Universitas Sumatera Utara. We also see that she wants to build a spirit of a student who continues to move in achieving achievements," he said.

He said that USU would fully support Wenda Yunita's activities by building a media campaign with USU Public Relations so that USU students could optimally support Wenda in the audition event.

“Wenda needs support in the form of support through social media platforms. So we will ask the USU Public Relations Team to build a kind of media campaign for her so that the Universitas Sumatera Utara students can provide the maximum support for Wenda through his Instagram account. Thus, there will be more support, and show that she has an extensive network and great support not only from USU, but also from her domicile area," he said.

Wenda Yunita Tarigan explained that the form of support was through social media platforms. "For example, if there is a post of photo or video, I hope that all of the students in the Universitas Sumatera Utara like it and make positive comments in the comments column," she said. (©ULC)
