The emergency response simulation was carried out to increase awareness of disasters that might occur in the laboratory such as fires and earthquakes. So that laboratory equipment needs to be educated on how to take steps when in a disaster situation.

HUMAS - The Integrated Laboratory of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an emergency response simulation assisted by PT Deksa Megaraya Indonesia and the National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) of Medan at the Integrated Laboratory of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) USU on Thursday, (09/01/ 2022).

Head of Integrated Research Laboratory Ir. Rahmi Karolina ST., MT., IPM said that her party carried out emergency response simulations to increase our awareness of disasters that might occur in the laboratory.

By holding the evacuation simulation, Ir. Rahmi Karolina ST., MT., IPM hopes that all laboratory equipment can be responsive to take action in the event of a disaster so that it minimizes casualties.

"Hopefully all of us who are in the integrated laboratory, laboratory equipment, and the head of the lab here can quickly take action, for example if something like a fire or an earthquake occurs we can minimize casualties," he said.

Director of PT. Deksa Megaraya Indonesia Taufiq Azria said that this evacuation simulation was a very good activity to do at USU. Because this training was conducted in a multi-storey building and USU has many high-rise buildings, with the assistance of BASARNAS, emergency response education for disasters was carried out to employees of the USU Integrated Laboratory.

On the same occasion, M. Rizal Rangkuti, the instructor of the Medan SAR Office, explained that there were two forms of evacuation carried out. Namely self-evacuation in earthquake and fire simulations by hiding under a table or slowly walking out looking for an evacuation route. The next evacuation is the evacuation of high altitudes by using equipment. In this simulation, for the first time it was carried out using PPE prepared by the Integrated Lab in a complete and safe manner.

"So there are two things related to evacuation, namely self-evacuation, when we simulate a disaster, for example, a fire or an earthquake, we can evacuate independently, either we hide under a table maybe or we walk slowly out through the evacuation route," said the instructor.
