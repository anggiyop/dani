"With the visit of the Singaporean Ambassador, we hope to encourage more student exchanges between USU and universities in Singapore," Prof. Himsar said.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted a public lecture titled "Singapore and Indonesia: Neighbours by Geography, Partners by Choice" on Friday, Aug. 2, 2024, at the university’s Senate Academic Room, 3rd Floor.

 

During the event, Singapore’s Ambassador to Indonesia, H.E. Kwok Fook Seng, discussed Singapore's limited resources due to its small size but highlighted the country's rapid progress in empowering its youth and advancing technology. He emphasized Singapore’s strategic partnerships with various countries, including Indonesia.

 

In his remarks, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., noted that USU has signed four Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and one Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with Singaporean institutions, including Singapore Health Services PTE LTD (SingHealth), the National University of Singapore (NUS), and Don Shudar International Workforce PTE LTD.

 

"We hope this event deepens our understanding of how Indonesia and Singapore can continue strengthening their partnership," added Prof. Muryanto Amin.

 

Singapore has maintained diplomatic relations with Indonesia for 57 years. Many Indonesian students pursue their studies in Singapore, and various partnership programs exist between educational institutions in both countries. This lecture allowed students to learn from Singapore's systems, which could be adapted to address challenges in Indonesia, particularly in climate change mitigation.

 

Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., M.T., Director of USU’s Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships, explained that USU has engaged in numerous internationalization activities with Singaporean universities, particularly in healthcare and palm oil research, and has facilitated student mobility programs, sending nearly 200 students abroad.

 

"With the visit of the Singaporean Ambassador, we hope to encourage more student exchanges between USU and universities in Singapore," Prof. Himsar said.

 

H.E. Kwok Fook Seng emphasized that USU students would benefit from this collaboration. With a medical lab at USU, students will have opportunities to learn and participate in research. He also highlighted the importance of building interpersonal relationships through personal connections and networks independent of government initiatives.

 

"Indonesia’s Minister of Health, Budi Sadikin, has introduced many reforms and made significant efforts to improve the healthcare sector. We support that journey. This is a concrete example of ongoing collaboration between the two countries," he explained.
