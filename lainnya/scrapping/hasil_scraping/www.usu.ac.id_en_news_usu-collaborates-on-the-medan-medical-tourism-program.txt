The memorandum of understanding was signed at the Heritage City Hall Hotel Medan.

In his remarks, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that USU had a significant role in this memorandum of understanding. USU's role is related to health education and specifically medicine, which examines diseases in tropical communities.

"The research results are expected to help other health industries or the people of North Sumatra in dealing with their illness," he said.

He said that the USU Hospital would improve the quality of its services and facilities to achieve international standards so that the people of North Sumatra no longer needed to go abroad for treatment.

"Let us work together to make the Medan Medical Tourism program a success with a strong determination," he said.

Mayor of Medan Bobby Afif Nasution, S.E., M.M. said that this program, will lead to economic movement in health, tourism, and education.

"Associations incorporated in this program require deliberation to resolve problems or obstacles and require the roles of these associations so that the program is carried out properly," he said.

He also hopes that USU will not only participate in the field of research but can also be implemented in other fields to advance the world of health.

"Hopefully, with this program, the development of the city of Medan will be even better in the future," said the Mayor of Medan.

On the same occasion, the Chairman of PERSI, dr. Syaiful M Sitompul said that seven hospitals collaborated, one of which was the USU Hospital (USU Hospital). He hopes that every hospital has standards that are appropriate for the community and promotional facilities so that people know about this program.

"I feel happy because Medan Medical Tourism has proceeded," he said.

ASITA chairman Solahuddin Nasution, S.E., MSP said that the program can also develop tourism in the city of Medan as in developed countries. This program will encourage people to visit North Sumatra because there are already hospitals with international standards.

"Therefore, there are no more medical travel packages abroad, only package trips to Medan or other cities in Indonesia. I appreciate this program because Medan tourism will develop," he said.
