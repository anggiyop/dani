About Silat USU Student Activity Unit

Since its establishment, the Silat USU Student Activity Unit has provided a platform for USU students who have an interest in martial arts and aim to improve their achievements in the field of silat. This student activity unit was founded to preserve and promote Indonesia's cultural heritage through traditional martial arts, which have become an integral part of the nation's identity. Through regular training and self-development programs, students participating in this student activity unit are developed to become skilled and accomplished silat athletes. They are taught basic techniques, competition strategies, and the mental skills required to achieve success in competitions or self-defense. The Silat USU Student Activity Unit also frequently organizes silat performances and workshops to introduce this martial art to the local community. This student activity unit is highly recommended for students who want to acquire martial arts skills as well as enhance their confidence physically and spiritually.
