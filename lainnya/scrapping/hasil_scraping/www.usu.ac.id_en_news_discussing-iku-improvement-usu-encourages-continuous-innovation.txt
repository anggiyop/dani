This Key Performance Indicator is one end of a process that is carried out continuously. This KPI starts in 2020 and 2021, before that it was a ranking at PTN, "said Prof. Muryanto.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Focus Group Discussion to discuss the Improvement of USU's Main Performance Indicators (IKU). The activity took place in the Academic Senate Meeting Room of the USU Central Bureau of Administration Building. On Thursday (07/09/2023).

KPI is a set of parameters that measure the achievement and efficiency of universities in achieving the goals of education, research, and community service. KPI serves as a guide that directs academic and administrative efforts, monitors student progress, and encourages continuous innovation.

In his speech, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si. said that KPIs have been the focus of continuous improvement since 2020 and 2021, in the ranking of higher education institutions in Indonesia. KPI plays an important role in innovation and creativity in developing new indicators, to improve the quality of education.

"This Key Performance Indicator is one end of a process that is carried out continuously. This KPI starts in 2020 and 2021, before that it was a ranking at PTN," said Prof. Muryanto.

The USU Chancellor also provided an understanding of the curriculum transition from the old to the MBKM curriculum, which is one of the keys to increasing KPIs. This requires adaptation and innovation, thus opening up opportunities for USU to form quality graduates in facing future dynamics.

"So we need to understand the process of these changes because it is a demand to produce quality graduates. An example is related to curriculum changes," explained Prof. Muryanto.

Finally, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si emphasized the need for innovation and creativity in higher education to create changes that can lift the Main Performance Indicators (KPI). Thus, paving the way for USU to optimize more dynamic and quality education.

"What I want to say is that universities must now be more innovative and creative to create changes that improve KPI indicators," said Prof. Muryanto.

Franova Herdiyanto, Sub-Coordinator of Higher Education Data at the Directorate General of Higher Education, Research and Technology of the Ministry of Education and Culture, said the government encourages universities to achieve programs such as IKU, by ensuring students participate in off-campus activities. It also encourages lecturers to engage in industry activities and collaborative work in curriculum transition to achieve international accreditation, as milestones towards improving the eight indicators of International Labour Organization (ILO) at USU.

"We encourage the Ministry's scheduled programs, such as KPI, to be achieved by every university. So we hope that the 8 indicators can be improved by USU," said Franova.
