"Indonesia's role in navigating the various challenges faced by ASEAN is highly necessary. In carrying out its chairmanship this year, Indonesia has adopted the theme ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth, with three key focus areas during its leadership," explained the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia

USU Public Relations – The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in collaboration with Universitas Sumatera Utara, held a Public Lecture titled “ASEAN, Global Challenges, and Indonesia’s Foreign Policy Role.” This event was conducted simultaneously in 38 provinces across Indonesia. The lecture at USU took place on Monday, August 21, 2023, in the Senate Meeting Room at the USU Central Administration Bureau Building.

 

The Public Lecture at USU represented North Sumatra Province, aiming to reach a broader audience by introducing ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and educating students on global challenges as well as Indonesia’s significant role in foreign policy as part of the Republic of Indonesia.

 

In her virtual welcoming speech, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, Retno Lestari Priansari Marsudi, highlighted the theme carried by Indonesia during its ASEAN Chairmanship: “ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth.”

 

She further explained that Indonesia’s chairmanship focuses on three main aspects: establishing a strong foundation for ASEAN’s 2045 vision amid an unfavorable global situation, strengthening Southeast Asia as a center for economic growth, and promoting the implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.

 

"Indonesia plays a crucial role in navigating the various challenges faced by ASEAN. In leading ASEAN this year, we have adopted the theme ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth, with three key focus areas," said the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

 

"First, we aim to establish a strong foundation for ASEAN’s 2045 vision in the midst of an unfavorable global situation, ensuring that ASEAN has the capacity to address future challenges and make decisions in emergency situations. Second, we seek to reinforce Southeast Asia as an Epicentrum of Growth by strengthening ASEAN’s resilience in food security, energy, healthcare, climate change, finance, and human resource development. Third, Indonesia's priority as Chair is to encourage the implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific," she continued.

 

The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, in his speech, explained how USU, as an educational institution, has strengthened its relationships with universities across Asia through student exchanges, collaborative research, and other forms of cooperation.

 

"To enhance collaboration among universities in Asia, we engage in student exchanges and collaborative research to maintain and establish partnerships," stated the USU Rector.

 

A representative from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bhima Dwipayudhanto, expressed gratitude to USU for hosting the public lecture. He was pleased with the enthusiasm of the students, who actively engaged in the session with critical questions, proving the event to be highly effective.

 

"We are very grateful to Universitas Sumatera Utara for its willingness to collaborate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in organizing this public lecture, which is held simultaneously in 38 provinces. USU represents North Sumatra in our efforts to reach a wider audience," said Bhima.

 

"Seeing the students' participation, we are delighted with their enthusiasm, and their questions were quite challenging. This proves that the lecture was highly relevant and effective," he added.

 

The Dean of the Faculty of Social Science and Political Science (FISIP) USU, Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., MSP, hoped that this public lecture would motivate students to achieve academic excellence, participate in student exchange programs and international competitions, and eventually take on roles as diplomats to advocate for Indonesia’s economic and foreign policy interests.

 

"Hopefully, this event will inspire students to excel, participate in student exchange programs, compete internationally, and even aspire to become diplomats who will advance Indonesia’s economic interests while upholding an independent and active foreign policy," said the Dean of FISIP USU.
