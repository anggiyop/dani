The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si appreciated the El-Shaddai Choir UKM which had won gold medals in international choral competitions.

USU's Director of Student Achievement and Alumni, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE., M.Sc., said USU's DITMAWALUMNI supports and fosters the achievements and creativity of USU students because it acts as a companion in improving the transformation of SME governance.

"We provide assistance, the first is improving the governance transformation of student activity units, because that is the basis for us to support, foster student achievement and creativity," said Doli.

Doli emphasized that later USU students who excel both nationally and internationally will be invited to the award night. On that night, USU will reward the efforts of outstanding students who contribute to the achievement of IKU at USU.

"Individually, USU students with national and international achievements will participate in the award night where we will provide incentives," he explained.

El-Shadai UKM supervisor, Prof. Dr. eng. Himsar Ambarita, ST., MT explained that El-Shadai is one of the choirs built by the lecturers' association. Some time ago, El-Shadai on behalf of USU won a medal in a competition held in Japan.

"So yesterday they went to participate in the competition, indeed they were carrying the name of USU, so today I want to convey to the Rector that we are bringing medals," said Prof. Himsar

The coach of El-Shadai mentioned that El-Shadai had coordinated with DITMAWALUMNI USU to gather the best students among the best to join and be ready for a bigger competition. This is because there are several Choir UKM groups at USU.

"So if there is a competition, come forward to collect the best of the best. So that the forces do not separate," he said.

Prof. Himsar Ambarita hopes that El-Shadai can fully support this because according to him if the scattered talents are brought together it will be something extraordinary.

"I hope El-Shadai also fully supports it because after all, if these talents are spread together, it will be even more powerful," he said. (©ULC)
