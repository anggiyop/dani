About PPDS

The Specialist Doctor Education Program (PPDS) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Faculty of Medicine (FK USU) is an advanced level of Medical Doctor Profession Education. Various fields of medical specialization have been established and accredited at the USU Faculty of Medicine, providing opportunities for general practitioners who graduated from FK USU to pursue specialist education at their alma mater. Since the establishment of PPDS in 1961, FK USU has gained extensive experience in educating PPDS students and producing competent graduates in line with the needs of the communities in Sumatra Island and, overall, Indonesia. With the support of the Coordination Team for the Implementation of the Specialist Doctor Education Program, FK USU is increasingly capable of conducting well-coordinated education, producing specialist-1 doctors who possess academic abilities and specialized services in accordance with the advancements in science and technology.

PPDS aims to produce Specialist-1 Doctors who are competent and able to provide specialized services in accordance with the development of medical science and technology. Some of the Specialist Doctor Education Programs (PPDS) that already existed in that year were the Pediatrics PPDS, led and taught by Prof. Jo Kian Tjai, Surgery PPDS by Prof. J.O. Picauly, Obstetrics and Gynecology PPDS by Prof. Tan Oen Siang, Internal Medicine PPDS by Prof. Ahmad Sofian, and Psychiatry and Neurology PPDS by Prof. Mohammad Ilyas Datuk Raja Enda Mora (Ildrem) Siregar. Through the various fields of specialist doctor study programs that have been formed, FK USU provides opportunities for general practitioners who have graduated from FK USU to continue their specialist education. Graduates are expected to provide the best services in their respective fields, advance scientific knowledge, and contribute to solving health-related issues.
