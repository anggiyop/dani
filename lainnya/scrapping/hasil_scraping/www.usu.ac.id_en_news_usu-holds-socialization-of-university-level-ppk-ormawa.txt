“I want to make sure that we can give serious attention so that we can really prepare professionally. I believe next year we already have a pattern that can be followed like the pattern in PKM, which has a schedule and sequence as well as substance in the context of assistance,” said Dr. Edy Ikhsan.”

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) carried out the Socialization of the University Level Student Organization Capacity Strengthening Program (PPK Ormawa) in Hall I of the Abdul Hakim Building of FK USU Clinical Pathology on Monday, (19/02/2024). This socialization was held in order to prepare all student organizations at USU for the 2024 PPK Ormawa competition.

The achievements made by HMJ FP USU in PPK Ormawa 2023 show extraordinary potential. Thus, this socialization aims to expand opportunities for students in the competition, which will be supported by more intensive assistance.

Vice Rector I of USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., in his remarks, stated that he would ensure that he paid serious attention and said that there would be a more effective system for preparing for the PPK Ormawa competition, especially in terms of assistance for students.

“I want to make sure we can give serious attention so that we can really prepare professionally. I am sure that next year we will have a pattern that can be followed like the pattern in PKM, which has a schedule and sequence as well as substance in the context of assistance,” said Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., said that PPK Ormawa is a ministry program that aims to increase the capacity of student organizations. Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., said that this year, USU has a large quota for sending proposals. Therefore, it is hoped that there will be more student participation in the competition.

“This year, we are trying to achieve greater achievements. I received information that we have a quota to be able to send 16-20 proposals this year. Therefore, we hope that more can enter and participate in the national PPK Ormawa competition,” said Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

Head of the USU Center for Student Achievement (Puspresma), Dr. Ir. E. Harso Kardhinata, M.Sc revealed that the campus is improving student organizations which will then give birth to achievements by students not only in the PPK Ormawa competition, but also in various other competitions.

“We are improving the institutional order of student organizations, we will build solid pillars between BEM, HMJ, student UKM groups, and so on. The better the relationship and coordination between them, the more a healthy student atmosphere will be built. It is a forerunner to have opportunities or achievements not only in this PPK Ormawa but also in other competitions, “said Dr. Ir. E. Harso Kardhinata, M.Sc.

For information, HMJ FP USU managed to bring one gold medal and two silver medals in PPK Ormawa 2023.
