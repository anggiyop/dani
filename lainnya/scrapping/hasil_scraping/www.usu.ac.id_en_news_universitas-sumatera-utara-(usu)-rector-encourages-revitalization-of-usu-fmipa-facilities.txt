USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: The Rector of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., paid special attention to the condition of educational support facilities at the USU Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA). During his working visit to the faculty on Friday (6/25/2021), he directly visited all existing facilities, from laboratories to toilet facilities.

Muryanto Amin found that many rooms were inadequate but were still used by students and lecturers in the teaching and learning process.According to him, this is quite worrying considering that FMIPA is one of the faculties which contribute the most of Student Creativity Proposals(PKM) at USU.

"After walking around, I saw that there were many inadequate facilities at FMIPA. Even though, as we all know, FMIPA is one of the largest contributors to PKM Proposals at USU," said the USU Rector.

He directly listened to the complaints felt by the USU FMIPA academic community.In his communication with one of the laboratory assistants, he received information that the existing equipment stillcame from the 1974 procurement.

The Dean of FMIPA, Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, MSc., confirmed this.He said that the faculty he led had been untouched by a comprehensive rejuvenation effort for a long time.Rejuvenation is needed toincrease student comfort.

"As we can see, especially in our laboratories, there are still many shortages of equipment needed. In FMIPA alone there are 28 laboratories, and all of them require a touch of rejuvenation. Some laboratories are even in very risky conditions touse," Nursahara said.

In response, the USU Rector hoped that the faculty would immediately map the needs and plans needed.He stressed that the plan must be completed immediatelyso that it can be budgeted immediately.

"In June we will enter a period of changing the Budget Work Draft (RKA), and in the eighth month we begin to draw up the RKA for 2022. So it is necessary immediately from the faculty to make a proposal. Please explain the needs and planning in detail, not only laboratory equipment, but the laboratory design It also needs to be conveyed. For the money, we will think about it and look for ittogether," Muryanto Amin said.

He linked the availability of adequate facilities to support points that have been USU's weakness.Muryanto Amin explained that so far USU needs improvement, especially in two aspects.

"There are two aspects that are USU's weaknesses in several ranking indicators, namely Tracer Study and student innovation. Tracer Study is our work together so that we can monitor our graduates. Meanwhile, to increase student innovation,adequate facilities are needed," he said.

In addition, he also hopes that adequate facilities will encourage FMIPA students to complete their studies on time.The USU Rector thoughtthat after hearing complaints from FMIPA lecturers who said students had difficulty completing research because of the incomplete facilities at USU's FMIPA.

The USU Rector was present at USU's FMIPA accompanied by the USU Vice Rectors, the Rector's Expert Staff, the USU PSI Head, and the USU Exist Team Leader.On the other hand, USU's FMIPA is represented by the Dean and Deputy Deans, as well as lecturers and education staff.(RR/©ULC)
