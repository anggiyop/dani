This activity took place at the USU Faculty of Economics and Business Hall Building on Wednesday, (01/03/2023).

In his remarks, the USU Rector congratulated the head and secretary of the study program and the newly appointed officials. The position that is held is expected to be a cog and executor who is able to act and think quickly to find the right formula in carrying out the established IKU achievement targets, as well as increasing the academic achievements of students and lecturers, multiplying the quality and quantity of community service, as a manifestation of tri dharma.

The USU Rector hopes for innovation in the way of working and not focusing on existing obstacles. Change requires focus and consistency so that the problems formulated can be resolved without any steps backward.

“If the achievement target itself individually is for now how to maintain the superior accreditation of the study program and if for per-field is probably the same, about strategies on how to improve accreditation and how to improve so that the IKU target can be achieved”.
