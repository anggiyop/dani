Muryanto Amin welcomed and expressed gratitude for completing the initial building phase of the Havea Cluster, which will serve as accommodation for teachers at Universitas Sumatera Utara.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara hosted a Soft Launch of the Havea Cluster of USU Lecturer Housing on behalf of USU Public Relations. The Rector of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si, and the President Director of PT Propernas Nusa Dua, Rizqi Awaransyah, conducted the symbolic opening in Prof. Suhadji Hadi Broto Hall FEB on Monday (20/02/2023).

This cluster's creation indicates a partnership between USU and PT Propnas Nusa Dua, the developer. The Rector USU applauded the completion of the initial building phase of this cluster because the Havea Cluster is designed to house USU faculty members. Moreover, this apartment is located close to the Kampus Bekala USU.

Muryanto Amin remarked, "I welcome and am happy for the completion of the initial building phase of Cluster Havea, which will serve as accommodation for teachers at the University of North Sumatra."

Housing in Cluster Havea is supported with a variety of sufficient facilities. The Rector hopes that lecturers and staff will effectively utilize the provided facilities, so they can encourage students and give their best attempts to the transformation and internationalization of USU.

"With the housing amenities provided, it is hoped that USU lecturers and staff would be encouraged to work greater and be more creative so that they can support the university in achieving its transformation and internationalization objectives with the best performance," he added.

Cluster Havea's ownership process is relatively straightforward. President Director of PT PND Rizqi Aswaransyah Pratama explained that the process begins with the collection of interest, followed by the selection of the unit of interest, the construction process, and finally, the handover of the unit.
