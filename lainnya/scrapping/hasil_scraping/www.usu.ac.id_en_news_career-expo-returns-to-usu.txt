The main hope is that our alumni will be absorbed into the job market. That way, it will increase our KPI. It is hoped that the younger siblings who will graduate will prepare themselves to fill the world of work.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is once again organizing the “USU Career Expo” Job Fair. This time the USU Innovation Research Development Agency (BPRI) collaborated with Garuda Organizer as the organizer of the activity which took place at the USU Pancasila Building, on Wednesday-Thursday (16-17/05/2023).

BPRI USU, as the initiator and facilitator, held the USU Career Expo for two effective days by targeting USU graduates and the general public to companies that need labor through the requirements and hiring process. Of course, with different qualifications, according to the policies of each company.

USU Career Expo field coordinator Ferdy stated that at least 35 Indonesian companies were invited from various fields, such as finance and manufacturing. The series of activities that take place are not only applying for jobs, but there are also interviews, and seminars at the company stand.

“There are approximately 35 companies in this stand. There are only Indonesian companies and the fields also vary from finance, manufacturing, and others. For the types of activities, besides applying for jobs, they can also come for direct interviews and can take part in seminars from the companies that provide them,” Ferdy explained.

USU Career and Entrepreneurship Manager Drs. Ami Dilham, M.Si., is optimistic that in the future, he will invite health fields such as hospitals so that the scope of enthusiasts who will contribute to the next activity will be wider.

“In the future, it will be developed in hospitals so that health graduates can contribute. Hopefully, this Career Expo will attract many enthusiasts,” said Drs. Ami.

The USU Career and Entrepreneurship Manager hopes to achieve the central focus related to the absorption of USU alumni in the job market. So that the achievement of KPI will also increase. Of course, the contribution of undergraduate students also needs to be optimized in preparing themselves to compete in the job market.

“The main hope is the absorption of our alumni into the job market. That way, it will increase our KPI. It is hoped that the younger generation who will graduate will prepare themselves to fill the world of work.”

For information, the USU Career Expo activity is a routine activity held twice a year by BPRI USU by targeting USU alumni to have a role in the world of work.
