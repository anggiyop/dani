"Furthermore, there is also a proposed collaboration program through the MBKM program, where students can intern at OJK, with the hope of enhancing students' skills and knowledge," Dr. Fadli expressed his hope.

USU PR — The Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) collaborated with the Financial Services Authority (OJK) to hold the OJK Berbagi seminar with the theme "Working Together to Build the Nation." The seminar occurred in the Prof. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall, FEB USU, on Tuesday (Mar. 19)

At least 16 universities in Medan participated in this seminar. The main objective was to broaden the student's knowledge and provide comprehensive information about the role and functions of the Financial Services Authority (OJK) in the Indonesian economy.

Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si., the Dean of FEB USU, stated that this seminar is a continuation of several collaborations between FEB USU and OJK. Through this event, there are opportunities for research cooperation, teaching methods development, and community service that support the Tri Dharma of Higher Education.

"Through the seminar held today, there are various ongoing collaboration activities, especially in support of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education, particularly in the field of research," explained Dr. Fadli.

Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si., also expressed his hope that the planned collaboration programs, including the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) program, can provide tangible benefits for students and improve the quality of education in FEB USU.

"Furthermore, there is also a proposed collaboration program through the MBKM program, where students can intern at OJK, with the hope of enhancing students' skills and knowledge," Dr. Fadli expressed his hope.

Saut Simanjuntak, the Head of the Department at the OJK Institute, enthusiastically stated that the day was an important moment to disseminate information and strengthen cooperation between OJK and educational institutions such as FEB USU. He also emphasized the importance of students' role in driving innovation and development in the financial sector.

"We chose students as the target because much of our research is currently related to young people, especially in the digital field. In universities, lecturers often teach students, and research results are disseminated using digital platforms," explained Saut.

According to Anton Purba, the Deputy Director of LJK II Supervision Office of OJK in North Sumatra Province, this activity provides new hope for students to understand the strategic role of OJK in maintaining economic stability and growth. He emphasized that OJK is responsible for the banking sector and oversees and regulates the capital market and other financial institutions.

"It is hoped that fellow students will become more familiar with OJK and become pioneers in disseminating information about banking formations conveyed by OJK as part of efforts to improve education and financial literacy in North Sumatra society in general," Anton hoped.
