“Pancasila is the foundation of our state and philosophy, so it is one of the unifying tools of the nation and, of course, in responding to it,” said Vice Rector III USU.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a ceremony to commemorate Pancasila's birth in the USU Central Administration Bureau Building courtyard on Saturday (Jun. 1, 2024).

In his speech, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. conveyed the theme of this year's commemoration, namely “Pancasila, the Unifying Spirit of the Nation Towards a Golden Indonesia 2045.” This theme implies that Pancasila unifies people by facing differences in ethnicity, religion, culture, and language to achieve the vision of an advanced, independent, and sovereign Golden Indonesia.

The USU Rector also invited the academic community to jointly internalize Pancasila's values in every aspect of life, society, nation, and state.

Vice Rector III of USU, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt. explained that Pancasila is the basis of the state. As a philosophy, it is a unifying tool for the nation that must be applied in everyday life, especially by the USU academic community.

Vice Rector III said that until now, the USU academic community has understood and applied the values of Pancasila well.

“Pancasila is the foundation of our state and philosophy, so it is one of the unifying tools of the nation and, of course, in responding to it,” said Vice Rector III USU.

The Secretary of USU, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp.F.E.R also emphasized that Pancasila has been proven to be the only tool to unite the nation and make it great. He emphasized that the entire academic community of the Universitas Sumatera Utara has the spirit of Pancasila and will implement it in every ceremony commemorating the birth of Pancasila.

“Of course, all of us, the academic community of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, certainly have the spirit of Pancasila and will carry out all the meanings contained in every ceremony that we do in commemorating the birthday of Pancasila,” concluded Prof. Fidel.
