USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., explained that the Social Science and Business Research Network (SSBRN) is an international academic event attended by reputable universities worldwide.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has the honor of being the main host for the international call for a paper conference in the field of Social Science and Business Research Network (SSBRN), as well as the Forum of Deans of Economics Faculties from 40 universities, which will be held at the University Marie Curie Sklodowska in Lublin, Poland, on 9-10 May 2024.

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., explained that the Social Science and Business Research Network (SSBRN) is an international academic event attended by reputable universities worldwide.

"This year, specifically the 7th SSBRN, USU has the honor of being the main host," said Prof. Muryanto during the SSBRN symposium in Poland.

The event is titled "The 7th SSBRN Symposium 2024: USU Award." In the 6th edition, Universitas Brawijaya served as the main host for the SSBRN, which was held at Selcuk University, Turkey.

During the 7th SSBRN event, in which USU serves as the main host, Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin also mentioned that other agenda items include implementing a Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with international campuses for guest lectures, student mobility, and joint research. USU will also visit the Indonesian Embassy in Poland.

The Rector of Marie Curie Sklodowska University (UMCS), Prof. Radoslaw Dobrowolski, Ph.D., D.Env., warmly welcomed the USU delegation, who served as the main host for The 7th SSBRN Symposium 2024: USU Award held in Poland. UMCS also expressed interest in collaborating with the oldest university in Sumatra.

"We will realize cooperation with USU, including sending several UMCS lecturers to become guest lecturers at USU. UMCS will also participate in inbound programs organized in USU's Summer Course program," said Prof. Radoslaw.

He added that UMCS would also make USU a destination campus for UMCS students in Poland as part of outbound programs.

He said, "This cooperation will certainly benefit both institutions by allowing them to expand their international academic networks."

The activities in Poland themselves are part of USU's internationalization program implemented over the past three years. USU's reputation under the leadership of Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin in the international arena is increasing, and it is hoped that in the coming years, USU will be able to become a top 500 world-class university.
