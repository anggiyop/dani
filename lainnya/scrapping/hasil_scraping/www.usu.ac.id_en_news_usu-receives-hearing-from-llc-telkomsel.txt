"In this case, it can be realised in based learning, so students do not only learn theory but can also learn to solve a problem," said the rector.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr Muryanto Amin S.Sos, M.Si. received a hearing from Medan's LLC Telekomunikasi Selular (LLC Telkomsel) and Telkomsel's subsidiary company, Kuenci. The activity took place in the Hearing Room of USU's Bureau of Administrative Centre, Friday (17/02/2023).

The USU Rector said that this hearing discussed the relationship between the education world and the workforce. In this case, it can fulfil the world of internships on campus. This program will be for students from USU and does not rule out the possibility of students from all over Indonesia.

"In this case, it can be achieved through based learning so that students will not only learn theory but also learn problem-solving," he concluded.

General Manager of Consumer Sales Telkomsel for North Sumatra Region, Erwin Tandra Saragih, S.E., said that Telkomsel chose to conduct a hearing at USU because Telkomsel has had many talents from USU alumni, which necessitates a closer relationship with USU.

"There are 193 USU alumni who are still actively working at Telkomsel all across Indonesia. It can be seen that USU alumni are outstanding," he said.

Telkomsel, as a state-owned company, hopes to leave an impact on the educational world, one of which includes USU. Not only that, but Telkomsel will also provide overview and learning to students to prepare themselves for the professional world.

"And students must know about the capabilities that align with what the workforce wants," said Erwin.

Similarly, Chief Operating Officer of PT Kuncie Pintar Nusantara Hendra Saputra, S.Kom, MBA, said that USU is a strategic partner in the educational world because the USU's greatness has been recognised at the national and international levels. Moreover, not only students but lecturers at USU can also contribute to education at the international level.

"USU lecturers can contribute in terms of Edutech, and this will further bring USU lecturers to the international level," he said.
