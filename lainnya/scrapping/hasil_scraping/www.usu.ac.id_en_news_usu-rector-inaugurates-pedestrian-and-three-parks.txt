“There are two categories that I do, the first is facilities that can be used by many people and many parties at the Universitas Sumatera Utara. Then secondly, there are many buildings in each faculty and other work units that have not been utilized, so they need to be optimized", said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) inaugurated the USU Pedestrian Zone 1, Al-Muslimun Park and Acacia Park of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA), and the Integrated UPT LAB Laboratory Park. This inauguration was held at FMIPA, on Thursday (25/01/2024).

There are two categories that will be focused on, namely improvements in public areas around USU and in each faculty.

“There are two categories that I do, the first is facilities that can be used by many people and many parties at the Universitas Sumatera Utara. Then secondly, there are many buildings in each faculty and other work units that have not been utilized, so they need to be optimized,” said the USU Rector.

The USU Rector also prepared a three-year period to zone academic and non-academic areas. The academic zone will be focused as a carbon emission-free zone and environmentally friendly zone.

“I am preparing or launching within three years at most, hopefully, the academic area that we want to divide, the academic zone area and the non-academic zone area. The non-academic area starts from outside from door 1 to door 4,” he added.

Dean of FMIPA USU, Prof. Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, M.Sc., with the inauguration of this park, will be used as a place for students to discuss in completing their assignments.
