Through this project, Indonesia is expected to lead the local production of robotic systems and their instruments.

For your information, the Robotic Telesurgery Project involves professional collaboration between medical professionals, technology experts, and industry to produce medical-grade products. Referring to the success of the implementation of this project at RSUP (regional general hospital) Dr. Hasan Sadikin Bandung and RSUP Dr. Sardjito Yogyakarta will be expanded and adapted in Indonesia’s Eastern and Western Regions.
