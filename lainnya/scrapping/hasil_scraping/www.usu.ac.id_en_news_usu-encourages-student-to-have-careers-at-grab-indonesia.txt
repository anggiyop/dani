"It is hoped that students who have participated in internships at PT Grab Indonesia have the ability according to the criteria. So, after completing their studies, these students can volunteer or be called by PT Grab Indonesia to work there," said WR III USU.

USU PR - Vice Rector III USU, Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt, encouraged USU students who met the criteria to continue their careers at PT Grab Indonesia after completing their studies.

This was conveyed during a coordination meeting between USU and PT Grab Indonesia, Monday (10/11/2021) in the Video Conference Room, USU Central Administration Bureau. Poppy explained that the partnership activity that was built with PT Grab Indonesia through the Merdeka Learning-Free Campus program was an effort to improve the quality of human resources of the USU academic community.

"It is hoped that students who have participated in internships at PT Grab Indonesia have the ability according to the criteria. So, after completing their studies, these students can volunteer or be called by PT Grab Indonesia to work there,” said Poppy.

Poppy asked the study program to actively communicate with Grab Indonesia to create a common perception of what kind of knowledge would be given to students. Curriculum recognition is important so that what Grab Indonesia provides is in line with the curriculum at USU.

“The study program can actively communicate with Grab Indonesia. Both must know each other what the expected achievements and goals after participating in the internship. I have instructed the USU Cooperation Bureau to assist and bridge the communication efforts," he said.

USU Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, emphasized that according to him the MBKM program is an effort to meet the needs of students to be ready to enter the world of work after completing their studies.

"MBKM is a matching process, a marriage process between campus and partners. So what is on campus must be agreed with what is on the partner. So that the results of the internship are in accordance with our wishes,” Edy said.

For information, the MBKM program will enter an even semester. Previously, the MBKM program for odd semesters had been officially launched and attended by USU students.

Currently, USU is preparing to conduct partnership cooperation in the even semester. Present at the event were deans, lecturers, teaching staff, and representatives from PT Grab Indonesia. (©ULC)
