"We are trying to support Bank Sumut, by providing excellent and trustworthy students who can then do internships or learning at Bank Sumut. We provide human resources, Bank Sumut provides the platform," said the Rector.

PR USU - Supporting the Independent Learning Campus (MBKM) program, the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) collaborates with various parties, including the Bank of North Sumatra.

The cooperation was stated in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between USU and PT Bank Sumut which was carried out to equalize perceptions and understanding of the cooperation that will be carried out in the future.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Sc., during a discussion with the board of directors of Bank Sumut at the Office of the Rector of USU, Wednesday (10/6/2021), explained that USU will prepare a cadre of competent students who can help Bank Sumut.

"We are trying to support Bank Sumut, by providing excellent and trustworthy students who can then do internships or learning at Bank Sumut. We provide human resources, Bank Sumut provides the platform," the Rector said.

The Rector said that the reason USU continues to collaborate with various parties is to minimize the gap between graduates and industry needs. Because the gap is an indicator of why graduates have not gotten a job after finishing college.

"We have to catch up with that. USU, through the Independent Learning-Independent Campus program, will cooperate with various parties," he said.

This collaboration is also expected to expand USU's opportunities and opportunities to progress significantly and achieve the goal of campus internationalization. The main objective is to improve the quality of human resources, as well as to open a wider space for the implementation of various activities that support the development of skills, knowledge and innovation.

"We hope that with the signing of this memorandum of understanding for the next five years, the relationship between the Universitas Sumatera Utara and PT Bank Sumut can be closer and able to make a positive contribution to both parties," he said.

The President Director of Bank Sumut, Rahmat Fadillah Pohan, emphasized that his party is committed to supporting the improvement of the quality of students at USU because USU has been a partner of Bank Sumut for a long time.

“USU's emotional relationship with Bank Sumut has existed since each institution was born. We are committed to supporting USU's progress and improving the quality of its students," Rahmat said.

Also present were Bank Sumut Marketing Director Hadi Sucipto, Bank Sumut Corporate Secretary Syahdan Ridwan, Head of Funds and Services Division Budi Anshari, Bank Sumut Head Iskandar Muda Branch Armyn S Kaban, Head of Bank Sumut USU KCP Thomas AC Tarigan.
