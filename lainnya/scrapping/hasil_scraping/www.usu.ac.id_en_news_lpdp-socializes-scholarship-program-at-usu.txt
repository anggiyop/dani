"USU supports its students to take part in this LPDP scholarship program," said Anggia.

PR USU - The Education Fund Management Institute (LPDP) carried out socialization activities for the LPDP Scholarship Program at the University of North Sumatra. The activity took place at the Student Center on Wednesday (18/05/2022).

Director of Education Development at the University of North Sumatra (USU) Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar ST., MMIT appreciates this activity because it can open up opportunities for students who want to continue their education but are hindered by costs.

With the presence of this scholarship, students who wish to continue their education will be funded by the state through the State Budget (APBN).

"USU supports its students to take part in this LPDP scholarship program," he said.

On the same occasion, Head of LPDP Communication Subdivision Ari Kuncoro conveyed several important points to prospective LPDP scholarship recipients. First, the LPDP scholarship is open to the public for students at the S2/S3 level. The scholarship does not have a specific quota.

Second, the biggest assessment in LPDP scholarships that prospective recipients need to pay attention to is meeting administrative requirements, being honest and not manipulating filling out documents, and being able to convince reviewers' comments during the interview stage.

Third, prospective LPDP scholarship recipients can choose various available scholarship programs according to their abilities.

"I hope that all students know about this LPDP scholarship," he said.

In addition, about 28 thousand people have become recipients of LPDP scholarships. This figure is increasing every year. The LPDP Scholarship will open its second phase on July 4, 2022.
