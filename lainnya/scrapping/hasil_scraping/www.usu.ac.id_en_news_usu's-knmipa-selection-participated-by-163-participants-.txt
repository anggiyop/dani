In his remarks, USU Vice-Rector I for Academic, Student, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH., M.A said that KNMIPA would be carried out in three stages: university level, regional level, to national level.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) in collaboration with the National Achievement Center, held the selection of the Mathematics and Natural Sciences National Competition (KNMIPA-PT) at the university level on Tuesday (31/05/2022) in the Prof Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall, Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) USU.

In his remarks, USU Vice-Rector I for Academic, Student, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH., M.A said that KNMIPA would be carried out in three stages: university level, regional level, to national level.

In 2022, KNMIPA will be attended by 163 participants from 10 faculties. Later, USU will select the 5 highest rankings from each field which will be included in the second stage of selection, namely the regional level selection, where USU enters Region 1 of North Sumatra.

"This selection is an important stage that the participants must pass to present their best performance before the jury," he said.

He added that the KNMIPA, which has been held since 2009, opens up four fields that the participants can participate in, namely: mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.

"For each field, the exam will be conducted in two sessions, in which in each session students must answer questions with the types of questions being multiple-choice, short entry, and description," he explained.

On the same occasion, Vice-Dean 1 FMIPA Dr. Cut Fatimah Zuhra, M.Si said that of the 163 participants who took part in KNMIPA, 23 were in mathematics, 36 in physics, 32 in chemistry, and the most in biology, 72.

"I hope the participants compete healthily and give the best results," he said.

Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE., M.Sc. also said that he hoped and believed that these intelligent participants would be able to advance to the national level in the future and get gold medals like in previous years.

"Hopefully, this year, the participants can win gold medals again," he concluded.
