“We want you all to have the courage to speak up and report if you experience or witness acts of sexual violence. You are valuable and must be respected,” said Prof. Isfenti.

HUMAS USU - The Faculty of Vocational Studies of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) continued the series of HSBC Guest Lecture 2024 activities by organizing the Socialization of the Sexual Violence Prevention Program. The event took place at the USU Student Center on Friday (01/11/2024).

 

This socialization presented two speakers, namely Sri Suriani Purnamawati, Head of the North Sumatra Office of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection and Family Planning (P3AKB); and the Chairperson of the USU PPKS Task Force, Dr. Meutia Nauly, S.Psi., M.Si., Psychologist. This event reflects USU's strong commitment through education and socialization of a campus free from sexual violence, by conducting roadshows to faculties at USU.

 

The Dean of the USU Faculty of Vocational Studies, Prof. Dr. Isfenti Sadalia, S.E., M.E., in her speech, emphasized the importance of this socialization as a preventive effort to protect students. She also emphasized the importance of understanding the difference between sexual harassment and violence and invited students, especially those who had just entered campus, to be more vigilant and concerned about their environment.

 

“We want you all to speak up and report if you experience or witness acts of sexual violence. You are valuable and must be respected,” said Prof. Isfenti.

 

The Head of the USU PPKS Task Force, explained that this socialization is part of the main tasks of the PPKS Task Force. He also explained the practical programs implemented by the PPKS Task Force, such as training “Pear Support” volunteers as a form of psychological support training, information campaigns through posters and social media of the USU PPRS Task Force, and strengthening the report hotline that can be accessed by students.

 

“We will recruit friends in the faculty to form an anti-violence team to make it more accessible and responsive,” said Meutia.

 

Dr. Meutia Nauly, S.Psi., M.Si., Psychologist also expressed her hope that students would be more active in supporting this program. This event reflects USU's strong commitment in creating a campus that is safe and free from sexual violence, in line with the vision of Empowered Women, Protected Children, Advanced Indonesia.

 

“All parties have a role to play in creating a conducive learning atmosphere, where students can focus on studying, lecturers can educate, and we can all carry out our duties optimally,” he said.
