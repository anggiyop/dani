USU PUBLIC RELATIONS – MEDAN: The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has collaborated with the Indonesian Architects Association (IAI) which was marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) online through a zoom meeting, Thursday (12/8/2021). The signing was done separately by USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., and the General Chair of the Indonesian Architects Association (IAI), Ar Ketut Rana Wiarcha, IAI.

In his remarks, the General Chair of the Indonesian Architects Association (IAI), Ar Ketut Rana Wiarcha, IAI, said that all parties, especially those who are members of the Indonesian Architects Association, must try to find solutions so that architect education can support the progress of the architect profession.

“Architects from Indonesia actually have adequate competence and understand the rules and regulations.It is an opportunity.Currently, our focus is on how to prepare architecture students who can synergize, collaborate and elaborate optimally,” he said optimistically.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin on the other hand expressed his hope that the MoU could be a guide for USU and IAI to implement the work program that was mandated by the signed MoU.

“Employing young people who have special talents in the field of architecture is certainly an advantage and opportunity to create unlimited creativity and innovation.The progress achieved by architects today is very fast and extraordinary," said Dr. Muryanto, appreciating.

He also reminded that universities and professional associations should be more open to progress.“Practitioners have more experience with their stake holders and practice clients.This must be used to support universities, among others, through teaching practitioner programs.”

With the convenience obtained in the digital era in finding sources of creativity and sharpening imagination, added Muryanto, young people must be guided so that their imagination does not go out of bounds.

“This is not needed to limit or barrier their productivity.But there must be a guide that can shape their imagination into positive and useful things.In addition, the curriculum must also be dynamic, able to respond to existing developments," the USU Rector said.

Also present on the occasion were USU Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt, USU WR 3 Expert Staff Siti Salmiah, drg, Sp.KGA, Secretary General of IAI Ariko Andika Bina, Chair of IAI North Sumatra Province Boy Brahmawanta, ST, MT, IAI, Chair of the IAI North Sumatra Honorary Council, Dr.Ar.Achmad Delianur Nasution, ST, MT, IAI, AA, IAP, Head of IAI Education Agency Ar Hendrajaya Isnaeni, M.
