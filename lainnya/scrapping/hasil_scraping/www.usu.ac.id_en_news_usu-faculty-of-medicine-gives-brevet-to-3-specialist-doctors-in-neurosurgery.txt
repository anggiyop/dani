"We will add more, considering that neurosurgery specialists are still lacking in North Sumatra," said Prof. Fidel.

HUMAS USU - Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a brevet for 3 neurosurgeons as well as an introduction to the specialist doctor education program (PPDS). This activity was held in Medan, Saturday (09/24/2022).

Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked (OG), Sp. OG (K)-Fer is also happy because USU Medical Faculty has added 3 new neurosurgeons from batches 28 – 30.

Considering that the number of neurosurgeons is still limited, the Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara hopes that the doctors will be spread throughout the territory of the Republic of Indonesia in order to meet the needs of services in the health sector in each district and city.

"We will add more, considering that neurosurgery specialists are still lacking in North Sumatra," Prof. Fidel said. 

Secretary of the Neurosurgery Study Program, dr. Abdurrahman Mousa Arsyad, M.Ked(NeuSurg), Sp.BS also expects quick action in health services, therefore neurosurgeons can be placed in all regions in North Sumatra.

In addition, dr. Abdurrahman Mousa Arsyad, M.Ked(NeuSurg), Sp.BS appealed to the students of the Faculty of Medicine to keep the spirit of gaining knowledge in order to achieve this very noble profession.

"The spirit, because once again it is said, this doctor is a very noble profession and this doctor is a continuous learning process until the end," he said. (©ULC)
