The students should have a strong understanding of digital technology, which includes skills in the use of productivity software, programming, data analysis, cybersecurity, and other related technologies," Prof. Muryanto explained.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) together with PT GOTO GOJEK TOKOPEDIA held a Talkshow in the framework of the GoCampus Roadshow, entitled 'Digital Transformation and What Students Need to Prepare for Their Career'. This activity took place at the Student Center, on Tuesday (09/26/2023).

This talk show presented three speakers, namely; Alfi Siregar, a content creator and USU alumni; Sahli Adrian Fauzi, as Area Head of Gojek North Sumatra; finally, Syafrizal Helmi Situmorang, S.E., M.Si., as a lecturer at the USU Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB).

USU Rector, Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M. Si. in his speech highlighted that universities and educational institutions must be able to adapt quickly to digital transformation. They also commit to preparing students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this digital era.

"Students must have a strong understanding of digital technology, which includes skills in the use of productivity software, programming, data analysis, cybersecurity, and other related technologies," explained Prof. Muryanto.

Prof. Sahli Adrian Fauzi revealed that this collaboration is a forum to prepare students to face a future that is increasingly racing with the development of digital technology. The purpose of the discussion is to increase understanding of digital information and the preparation needed in a world of work that is increasingly related to technology.

"So we are collaborating to prepare students so that in the future they can better face the growing digital challenges," said Sahli.

Syafrizal Helmi Situmorang highlighted the importance of collaboration with industry, where companies like Go-Jek can provide technical skills that are not covered in the university curriculum. This is a good first step to ensure the readiness of USU students to face the growing demands of the digital industry.

"To students, you must have cognitive and collaborative skills. Also, understand data literacy, and have good digitalization skills," Syafrizal said.

As a content creator, Alfi Siregar appreciates this collaboration. Because, Gojek provides facilities to students, in developing skills in digital media through GoCampus. Thus, it will open up new opportunities for students in the world of the digital media industry.

"I myself am happy because when I started as a content creator, no one supported me, and I am happy that now there are many companies that support me, such as Go-jek," said Alfi.
