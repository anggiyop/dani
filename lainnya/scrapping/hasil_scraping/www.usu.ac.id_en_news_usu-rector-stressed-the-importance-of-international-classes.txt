" Now, the task is to become an entrepreneurial university. The achievement of this indicator outlines the principles of an entrepreneurial university. Many changes have been made; for example, we used to rely only on teaching and research, but now we do not do that anymore, and the task of being an entrepreneur must involve innovation," said the Rector of USU.

HUMAS USU - For the Rektor Menyapa Program, the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si visited the Faculty of Medicine of USU on Friday, (06/01/2023).

Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si explained several matters, such as the 2023 plan - the International Class program until USU becomes an entrepreneurial university. In his presentation, the USU Rector explained that USU, which holds the status of PTN-BH, is encouraged to continue to innovate so that the indicators each year can be achieved starting from the stage of program preparation and budget allocation to solving various problems.

" Now, the task is to become an entrepreneurial university. The achievement of this indicator outlines the principles of an entrepreneurial university. Many changes have been made; for example, we used to rely only on teaching and research, but now we do not do that anymore, and the task of being an entrepreneur must involve innovation," said the Rector of USU.

Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of USU, Prof. Dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe, Sp.S(K) said that there were several things for the faculty of Medicine to evaluate, such as improving strategies to achieve university targets in the fields of quality improvement of the curriculum to the use of USU E-learning.

"The targets we should achieve in the upcoming 2023, then check the targets that have been compiled that we can achieve well, such as renewals of the Faculty of Medicine will do in the future to achieve the university's targets. Perhaps we will focus more on improving the quality and implementation of the curriculum. Likewise, we will increase the use of e-learning," said the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine.
