“Your success in passing the selection is clear evidence of extraordinary dedication and hard work,” said Prof. Mury.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) successfully held a release ceremony for students who will participate in the 37th National Student Science Week (PIMNAS), Indonesian Student Entrepreneurship (KMI) Expo XV, and the 2024 Energy Efficient Car Contest (KMHE) on Friday (04/10/2024) in the courtyard of the USU Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB).

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in his speech, congratulated the students who were selected as USU delegates for the three prestigious events. He appreciated the hard work of the students who had successfully passed the selection and hoped they could make the alma mater proud.

 

For the 37th PIMNAS which will take place at Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, on October 14-19, 2024, USU is sending 53 delegates consisting of 11 teams. The USU Rector has high hopes that the achievements at this year's PIMNAS can surpass the achievements of the previous year, where USU won 2 silver medals and 1 favorite award.

 

Meanwhile, at the KMHE event, USU will compete with two cars named “Halisungsung Evo II” and “Boraspati” in the Urban Concept Diesel Internal Combustion Motor and Prototype Diesel Internal Combustion Motor categories. The competition that will take place on October 6-10, 2024 at the Jakarta International E-Prix Circuit is expected to bring better achievements than the previous year.

 

For KMI Expo XV, which will be held at Universitas Halu Oleo, Kendari, on October 23-25, 2024, USU is sending three teams focusing on two digital businesses and one non-digital business. The Rector hopes that this team can achieve results commensurate with the hard work that has been done.

 

The Rector also emphasized that students' participation in this national event is clear evidence of achievement, dedication, and hard work. He hopes that the students will not only uphold sportsmanship but also be able to learn and develop themselves during the competition.

 

The Rector also said that the enthusiasm, expertise, and winning mentality possessed by the delegates will lead USU to great achievements. He also reminded that events such as PIMNAS not only test intellectual abilities, but also creativity, innovation, and student collaboration.

 

“Your success in passing the selection is clear evidence of extraordinary dedication and hard work,” said the Rector.

 

The Dean of the USU Faculty of Engineering, Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM, ASEAN Eng, SMIEE, in his speech expressed the university's full support for student innovation and creativity. He hoped that the USU delegates could win the event and encouraged new students to dare to develop their potential.

 

“Yes, of course, we hope that the delegates will bring home the champions,” hoped the Dean of FT USU.

 

This release event symbolizes the full support of the university for students who will fight to make USU proud in the national arena. The delegates are expected to bring home achievements and inspiration for other students.
