he agricultural sector in Desa Suka holds promise, particularly with the byproducts of farming, such as straw. Unfortunately, this waste is rarely utilized optimally. In livestock farming, especially with goats, feed is often prepared without considering proper nutritional needs. As a result, the goats’ body weight is suboptimal, and they are more susceptible to disease. This not only economically disadvantages the farmers but also leads to unstable incomes.
