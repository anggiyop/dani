“From Ditmawa and its ranks, we created a bootcamp program. We present young speakers with national experience,” said the Director of Ditmawalumni USU.

USU PR - The Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (Ditmawalumni USU) held a “Friendly Gathering” by inviting 2024 National Sports Week (PON) Athletes, National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS) Delegates, and Energy Saving Car Contest Delegates. This activity was held at the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB) Level 1, on Wednesday (30/10/2024).

The “Friendly Gathering” activity is a form of appreciation from Ditmawalumni USU to students for bringing the name of the province and university in prestigious competitions. With the achievements made by these students, it is hoped that they can inspire other students to continue to excel and make USU proud in various fields.

Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi., as Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations (Ditmawalumni USU) said that he continues to support student activity programs by creating bootcamp programs and assistance in undergoing competitions.

“From Ditmawa and its ranks, we created a bootcamp program. We present young speakers with national experience,” said the Director of Ditmawalumni USU.

Furthermore, Rahma, mentioned to students to continue to improve strategies, breakthroughs and innovations so that they can compete with other universities in Java.

“This is also the biggest challenge to make new breakthroughs. We must find new strategies to improve our achievements,” she said.

Muhammad Gahara Bastari, as Manager of the USU Division of Character Development, Creativity, and Student Achievement, explained the mechanism that students must undergo if they want to take part in national and international competitions, namely by participating in socialization and selection from the university level.

“The mechanism remains the same. We socialize first and then we go to the workshop, all those who participate in the socialization and those who participate in the workshop have been selected by the university,” he explained.

Jasmine Meilani Halim, one of the Industrial Engineering students who participated in the National Student Science Week (PIMNAS) competition in participating in a competition like this must require extraordinary patience and consistency so that every effort made is maximized.

“The PKM journey is long. You have to be consistent, you have to be patient, it's a tough struggle but it's memorable,” she said.
