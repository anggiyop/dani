“Education is Mrs. Kartini's main struggle, and as education implementers, we must maintain quality and provide the best service to the community,” he said.

 

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Morning Assembly which was coupled with the commemoration of Kartini Day. This assembly was led by the Director of USU Education Development, Ir. Ikhsan Siregar ST., M.Eng., P.hD and attended by lecturers, education personnel, and other academicians. It occurred at the USU GBPA Court, on Monday (21/04/2025).

 

In his mandate, Ir. Ikhsan Siregar ST., M.Eng., P.hD emphasized that the values of R.A. Kartini's struggle are still very relevant today, especially in fighting for education, independence, and equal rights.

 

“Education is Mrs. Kartini's main struggle, and as education implementers, we must maintain quality and provide the best service to the community,” he said.

 

In addition, Ikhsan Siregar ST, M.Eng., P.hD, also invited the entire academic community to emulate the spirit of independence exemplified by R.A. Kartini in decision-making, and uphold the principle of equal rights without gender discrimination.

 

“We must be independent and responsible in every decision, and ensure everyone gets an equal portion,” he continued.

 

This commemoration also reflects the importance of collaboration and innovation in the educational environment, primarily to support the institution's progress.  Ikhsan Siregar ST., M.Eng., P.hD emphasized that USU has implemented equality in various lines, including women's leadership at the faculty and university levels.

 

“At USU, there is no differentiation; all have the same opportunity to lead and contribute, both men and women,” he said.

 

Ikhsan Siregar, ST., M.Eng., Ph.D., also hopes that the momentum of Kartini Day can be a source of inspiration for the entire academic community, especially women, to continue to take an essential role in the advancement of education and the development of science. Kartini's spirit is believed to be able to become a foothold to give birth to future leaders and innovators from the USU campus environment.

 

Through this morning's assembly activity, which coincides with Kartini Day, USU wants to reaffirm its commitment to building an inclusive, equal, and equitable campus for all academicians. This momentum is also a reminder that educational progress is not only about academic achievement but also about the courage to continue to create new spaces that empower all parties without exception.
