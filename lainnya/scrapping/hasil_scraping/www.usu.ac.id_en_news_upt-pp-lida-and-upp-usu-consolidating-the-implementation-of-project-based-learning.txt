"Because Project Based Learning is still new, we need input and also a basic understanding of Project Based Learning from UPP, so we invited UPP. At LIDA we have 111 MKWK lecturers. We want to immediately revise the semester learning plan (RPS) and strengthen the RPS so that later it will provide an increase in the university's KPI as mandated by the Rector," the Head of UPT PP LIDA said.

USU PR - Technical Implementation Unit (UPT) Lecture Center and Laboratory of Basic and General Sciences (UPT PP LIDA) in collaboration with the Education Development Unit (UPP) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) carried out activities for Strengthening the Implementation of Project Based Learning (PBL) for USU lecturers who teach compulsory curriculum (MKWK) courses at the Basic Physics Laboratory Building, Wednesday (1/12/2022).

Head of UPT PP LIDA Prof. Dr. Timbangen Sembiring M.Sc said that the activity brought together MKWK lecturers who would implement Project Based Learning as a tangible form of providing improvements in the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) as mandated by USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si.

"Because Project Based Learning is still new, we need input and also a basic understanding of Project Based Learning from UPP, so we invited UPP. At LIDA we have 111 MKWK lecturers. We want to immediately revise the semester learning plan (RPS) and strengthen the RPS so that later it will provide an increase in the university's KPI as mandated by the Rector," he said.

Prof. Dr. Timbangen Sembiring M.Sc added, USU lecturers who teach MKWK must already have RPS and are required to have Information Technology (IT) skills.

“In LIDA, one of our tasks is to prepare and distribute lecturers to study programs or courses that require lecturers. So the preparation is that all MKWK lecturers at least have RPS and understand IT, "he said.

Head of the Education Development Unit Prof. Dr. Dwi Suryanto, M.Sc., said the Project Based Learning method can be applied in several MKWKs and can improve KPI. This PBL is also an effort to support the policies of the Ministry of Education and Technology in the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program.

"The target for KPI 7 is that there are several courses and the Based Practice method, this is also a government program offered through the MBKM and from this Based Practice, we can pass it on to the courses that we now start with the MKWK first," he said.

Prof. Dr. Dwi Suryanto, M.Sc., emphasized that his party will provide training related to PBL so that it can unite the perceptions of USU lecturers regarding PBL.

"We will provide training this year so that the perception of Project Based Learning is the same and we will pass it on to all lecturers and that is our goal to invite collaboration. It is planned that this year UPP will conduct training so that lecturers at USU understand what Project Based Learning really is and that is our target as well," he said. (©ULC)
