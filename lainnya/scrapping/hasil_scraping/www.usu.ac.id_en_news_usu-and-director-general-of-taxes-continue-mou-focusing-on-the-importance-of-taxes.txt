"Providing support to increase the competence and skills of USU graduates will help align them with the needs of human resources in the industrial world," said the USU Rector.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) continued its cooperation by signing a memorandum of understanding with the Regional Office of the Directorate General of Taxes of North Sumatera I on Wednesday, July 17, 2024. This cooperation is related to the Tax Center, which has been established for 16 years in the USU area. The signing ceremony was held in the Rector's Audience Room.

 

The Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) of North Sumatra I established the Tax Center at USU as a form of concern in serving the community. The Tax Center assists the public in consulting about taxes paid and procedures for paying them. In this case, 77 USU students were selected as Tax Volunteers for the Country (Renjani) 2024.

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., said that this could provide an opportunity for USU students to implement the knowledge they have gained during lectures, especially in the field of taxation.

 

He said, "Providing support to increase the competence and skills of USU graduates will help align them with the needs of human resources in the industrial world."

 

The USU Rector added that this cooperation will later extend to education, research, community service, and the development of the Tax Center.

 

He added, "It consists of implementing tax education and dialog with the USU academic community and the community."

 

Head of the Regional Office of the Director General of Taxes of North Sumatra I, Dr. Arridal Mindra, Sp.I., M.Si., said that the Tax Volunteer Program for the Country (Renjani) is to help socialize programs at the Director General of Taxes.

 

"The most important target is students who are just one step away from entering the world of work," he said.

 

Finally, this activity was continued with a public lecture entitled "Getting to Know Tax Closer." Also present were Lusi Yuliani, Head of Extension, Services, and Public Relations, and Dr. Arida Susilowati, S. Hut., M.Si, Manager of Tax Center USU.
