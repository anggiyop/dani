Dr. Diana said that 70 countries had cooperated with CIRAD. And some of the target group participants for this activity are cooperative managers, company managers, bankers, and others.

HUMAS - The Consortium Studies On Smallholder Palm Oil (CSSPO) held a sustainability training activity on the talent program for the period 2022-2026, one of which was the Sustainable Finance and Financing Workshop for banking staff, on Tuesday (09/13/2022).

As a moderator, Dr. Diana Chalil said that this activity is one of the activities of the talent program, in which USU has collaborated with CIRAD for 4 years. CIRAD is a French research center that collaborates with developing countries in the world to deal with and solve agricultural and international developmental problems.

Dr. Diana also said that 70 countries had cooperated with CIRAD. And some of the target group participants for this activity are cooperative managers, company managers, bankers, and others.

Practitioner Lecturer at Medan University Area Dr. Minda Mulyana Sebayang, SE, M.Si, Ak hopes that after this activity the results of the report will be made more detailed and presented with the data submitted transparently, so that it can be accessed by anyone, because sustainability in the future is important.

In line with this, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Green Trade Initiative Foundation (YIDH) Fitrian Adriansyah hopes that Bank SUMUT is able to cover one province so that their system makes finances easier and has an impact on North Sumatra in terms of the environment, and USU can help the Bank SUMUT in terms of: concrete things that can be directly to farmers so that crop yields can be further increased.

"Yes, I hope that with USU's collaboration with the Bank SUMUT, many farmers will be helped by the existing loan funds," he concluded.

CIRAD Regional Director for Southeast Asia Island Dr. Jean Marc Roda said that this activity is about financing and it is very important because usually banks do not know how to carry out sustainable protection, so this form of action is very important, so CIRAD provides banks with the knowledge needed for banks to provide good knowledge for investment.

Dr. Jean also said that collaboration with universities is a form of collaboration with professionals, and CIRAD is trying to change programs that are formed with the approval of professionals to form a new sustainability. And the continuation is that the participants have approved ideas, so CIRAD works from within so that the participants who have ideas can be realized. (©ULC)
