ISO 17025 is an ISO standard used by laboratories which is a general requirement for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories. OHS Parameter Items must be implemented to obtain ISO 17025.

USU's Public Relations - UPT USU's Integrated Research Laboratory held a Laboratory Occupational Safety and Health (K3) workshop. This K3 training was held at the USU Integrated Research Laboratory UPT Building for 2 days on 29-30 September 2021.

Head of UPT Integrated Research Laboratory, Ir. Rahmi Karolina, ST, MT, said that this training is part of the preparation for administering ISO 17025 for laboratories.

ISO 17025 is an ISO standard used by laboratories which is a general requirement for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories. OHS Parameter Items must be implemented to obtain ISO 17025.

"This K3 training is also to increase awareness of laboratory equipment to be more aware of the risks that exist in every job," said Ir Rahmi Karolina.

The training participants are members of the Integrated Research Laboratory UPT, namely 3 heads of fields, 6 heads of laboratories and 10 laboratory assistants.

The resource persons were presented from the Deksa Megaraya Indonesia and the Medan City Fire and Prevention Service (P2K).

On the first day, the participants received socialization and awareness of the importance of K3. Then proceed with a simulation of how to arrange a table according to the 5R (Concise, Neat, Clean, Careful and Diligent).

"We practice directly how we make the scope of the lab on the table, how to give a sign," explained Ir. Rahmi Karolina.

The second day of training was continued with basic first air material with cardiac resuscitation practices.

Then there is also basic fire fighting material with a simulation of extinguishing a light fire using a gunny sack fire extinguisher. The participants looked enthusiastic and began to be able to extinguish the fire well.

"Lab equipment can better understand what the risks of our work are, then we can be prepared for any possible risks that may occur, then they can also be responsive and quickly deal with work accidents," said the Civil Engineering Lecturer. (©ULC)
