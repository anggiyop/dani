"This was the signing of the MoU between Unilever and USU. Earlier, Unilever management explained to us that this collaboration is beneficial for Unilever and USU, especially USU graduates," the USU Rector said.

USU PR – Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., received an audience from Unilever to discuss the design of the cooperation. The visit took place in the Audience Room of the USU Central Administration Building on Monday (4/11/2022).

During the hearing, the Rector signed a memorandum of understanding between Unilever and USU. USU and Unilever will cooperate in the form of recruitment of USU graduates as experts and an internship program for those who want to work at Unilever, although some have previously worked at Unilever.

"This was the signing of the MoU between Unilever and USU. Earlier, Unilever management explained to us that this collaboration is beneficial for Unilever and USU, especially USU graduates," said the USU Rector.

Not only that, in the future several other activities will also be developed. “Recruitment for experts, who want to work at Unilever can do an internship first. Now it's actually happened but still some people. We will scale it up and develop it in other activities," Muryanto Amin said.

On the same occasion, the Director of PT Unilever Oleochemical Indonesia, Endy Juliesetiawan, said that the next step is to hire for recruitment in the trainee management program. Endy Juliesetiawan also hopes that USU's departments or faculties soon are able to join the program.

"Obviously we've done the hiring for recruitment as is currently going on for our management trainee program. So we, from several departments or faculties at USU, hope that we can join our trainee management program or our leadership program soon," the Director of PT Unilever said.

With this collaboration, the Director of PT Unilever Oleochemical hopes that in the future the Unilever industry can be filled by skilled experts from North Sumatra graduates, especially USU graduates.

"Surely as an industry operating in North Sumatra, we hope that the development of our industry will be filled by experts, skilled workers, or graduates from North Sumatra specifically from USU," Endy Juliesetiawan mentioned.

In addition, the Dean of the USU Faculty of Law (FH) Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M. Hum. said After this MoA, PT Unilever cooperated with USU's Faculty of Law in recruiting management training for the legal field. According to him, many forms of cooperation can be developed, including MBKM and independent studies.

The Dean of USU Faculty of Law also hopes that Unilever will be able to absorb a lot of workers from USU alumni, especially USU FH graduates.

"We also hope that in the future we can develop in other fields because there are terms of agreement that we have made in the Memorandum of Understanding and Memorandum of Agreement," explained Mahmul Siregar. (©ULC)
