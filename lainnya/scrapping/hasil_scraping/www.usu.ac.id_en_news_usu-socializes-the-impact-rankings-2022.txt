“USU must report its contribution to the 17 sustainable development goals or SDGs. So the more contributions, of course, the ranking will improve and it can increase USU's reputation in the international world,” said Prof. Himsar.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Socialization and Initial Coordination Meeting for the 2022 THE Impact Rankings Form. The activity was carried out in order to report USU's contribution to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Held at the Auditorium of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) on Friday, (09/30/2022).

Director of the Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships Prof. Dr. eng. Himsar Ambarita ST., MT as the speaker in this activity said that in supporting USU's internationalization achievements and increasing USU's reputation internationally, a large contribution is needed by USU and the entire academic community. One example of supporting this contribution is by doing community service by lecturers and students.

“USU must report its contribution to the 17 sustainable development goals or SDGs. So the more contributions, the better the ranking will be and that can increase USU's reputation internationally," he explained.

Prof. Dr. eng. Himsar Ambarita ST., MT hopes specifically for the SDGs, USU is expected to achieve the highest internationalization and also from the Times Higher Education (THE) Impact, USU has a great potential to enter the top 500. Target for this activity is in November and consider other contribution target.

USU Vice Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Sc., Apt said that in this socialization stage, it is hoped that all work units can have an understanding in each of the SDGs activity agendas. He also added that all activities carried out by the academic community have been accommodated in the sustainable development goals or SDGs.

"This is still the socialization stage, hopefully all work units can understand the questions in each unit, so they can collect data and actually the data is already in the activities of all academics," she said in an interview.

In supporting the success of this activity, mentoring will be carried out for each workshop in various activity units.(©ULC)
