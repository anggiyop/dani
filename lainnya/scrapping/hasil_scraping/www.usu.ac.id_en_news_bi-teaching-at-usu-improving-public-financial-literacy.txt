"It is hoped that we can understand digital financial services and products, and contribute to the vision of Advanced Indonesia. Through wise and sustainable use of technology," hoped Vice Rector II USU.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and Bank Indonesia (BI) collaborated to hold the Bank Indonesia Teaching program, entitled 'Peran dan Tugas Bank Indonesia: Transformasi Digital Menuju Indonesia Maju'. The activity took place at the USU Student Center. On Friday (25/08/2023).

The Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) teaching practitioner activity initiated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology (Kemendikbud Ristek) facilitates the exchange of knowledge, expertise and experience from professional practitioners at BI, to participants. With the hope that USU graduates will be better prepared to enter the workforce.

BI Mengajar this time presents Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Governor Destry Damayanti as a guest speaker. The participants will receive education on digital transaction security, the importance of digital financial literacy, digital transformation in the financial sector and maintaining a balance between innovation and financial stability in realizing an advanced Indonesia.

USU's Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP., warmly welcomed the support from BI in the form of CSR fund donations. USU and BI are committed to the development of education. Thus, the BI contribution will be allocated to the development of facilities and infrastructure for academic activities.

“On behalf of the USU leadership, we would like to express our gratitude for the support given by Bank Indonesia to USU, in the form of CSR fund donations,” said Arifin.

Vice Rector II also added that the cooperation between USU and BI encourages research and innovation in the field of digital finance. The goal is to develop technologies that support financial services and study the economic impact of digital transformation. Thus, it can create a sustainable digital ecosystem and prepare superior human resources.

“It is hoped that we can understand digital financial services and products, and contribute to the vision of an advanced Indonesia. Through wise and sustainable use of technology,” hoped Arifin.USU Faculty of Law student class of 2021, Meli Mariana, as a seminar participant, stated that this activity brought significant benefits. Especially for Faculty of Law students who previously had little interaction with economic concepts. This program provides a deep understanding of BI's role in digital transformation, which is relevant to everyday life.

“Regarding Bank Indonesia teaching, I hope it will be held again with different topics and can be sustainable on today's digital topics,” Meli hoped.
