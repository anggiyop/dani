UNAIR proposed this working visit to increase knowledge and insight, especially on matters related to the Tri Dharma of Higher Education. Head of UNAIR Academic Senate, Prof. Djoko Santoso, dr. Ph.D.,Sp.PD.,K-GH.FINASIM said that something must be learned from a working visit at USU, especially with matters relating to local content.

PR USU – Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a working visit from the Academic Senate from Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR). This activity was attended by 10 participants from UNAIR and took place in the Senate Room of the USU Central Administration Building on Thursday (09/06/2022).

UNAIR proposed this working visit to increase knowledge and insight, especially on matters related to the Tri Dharma of Higher Education. Head of UNAIR Academic Senate, Prof. Djoko Santoso, dr. Ph.D.,Sp.PD.,K-GH.FINASIM said that something must be learned from a working visit at USU, especially with matters relating to local content.

“So the goal is to have something to be gained by studying at USU. Especially the local content in Medan," he said.

According to him, with Indonesia's vast territory, USU is at the forefront on the island of Sumatra regarding the nation's progress. So, what is obtained from USU, will later become an overview of the curriculum that will be proposed to the UNAIR Rector.

"We know that Indonesia is extensive, and we can see that on the island of Sumatra, USU is at the forefront regarding the nation's progress. So also for the rest of Indonesia. So what we got at USU will later become a curriculum outline which we will propose to the UNAIR Rector," added Prof. Djoko.

UNAIR chose USU for this working visit to show the fair give-and-take relationship between the two universities because USU has visited UNAIR first.

“So it is like, sharing because my colleague, Prof. Suwarto, is my senior. A few months ago, he visited UNAIR, so we also want to visit USU. It shows a kind of take and gives that is very fair in terms of the relationship between the two universities, which might be something that can be imitated from others," said the Chair of the UNAIR Academic Senate.

Prof. Djoko also believes that each university implements the Tri Dharma Policy at USU nationally. So that the policies contained in USU can be used as material for exchanging ideas because they can complement Indonesia's diversity.

"Oh, I think nationally the policies will be implemented by each university, so what makes USU special is local conditions, so that by exchanging ideas and exchanging discourses, it will complete our Indonesianness," he added.

On the same occasion, the Chair of the USU Academic Senate, Prof. Dr. Suwarto, SH, MH said that during a visit to UNAIR a few months ago there were also things that USU adapted. Such as fulfilling things that do not yet exist and improving existing policies.

"Like our last visit, we have visited UNAIR, of course, there are things that we adapt, which ones we don't fulfill, we will continue to improve what we have," he said.

In the end, Prof. Suwarto hopes that the two universities can advance and complement each other in the future.

"The hope remains the same. The important thing is that we also advance. Airlangga is still more advanced, that's why we go forward to complement each other, right, that's what we all hope for. Hopefully, we will all advance not only USU but UNAIR as well," said Prof Suwarto.
