“Dialogues like this are very relevant in building collective awareness that the unity and integrity of the nation must always be a common priority,” he said at the dialogue.

 

 

Public Relations USU—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted a national dialogue event to strengthen brotherhood and maintain the nation's integrity. The dialogue with the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) invited several religious, political, community leaders, and students. This activity began warmly at the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB USU) on Monday (24/03/2025).

 

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said North Sumatra is not only used as a miniature of Indonesia or multicultural Indonesia, but North Sumatra can be a place of lessons on how to live comfortably in peace despite differences.

 

“Dialogues like this are very relevant in building collective awareness that the unity and integrity of the nation must always be a common priority,” he said at the dialogue.

 

Furthermore, Vice Chairman of Commission XIII of the House of Representatives, H. Sugiat Santoso, S.E., M.SP., said that there is a program called the Four Pillars Program, namely the ideology of Pancasila, the 1945 Constitution, NKRI, and Unity in Diversity. These pillars are a reference to always harmonize the interests of the nation.

 

“If we do not prioritize these four pillars, the shape of our country will be shaky,” he said.

 

Deputy I BNPT, Major General Sudaryanto, S.E., M.Han, said that today's activity, presenting several community leaders and religious leaders by producing elements of society who participated, will become pawns connecting the tongue to other communities.

 

"Inviting elements of society, we also discuss nationality. Unifying perceptions of how the world will develop in the future," he said.

 

On this occasion, Tuan Guru Batak, Dr. Ahmad Sabban Rajagukguk, M.A., said that this dialogue can increase national unity so that there is no gap for terrorists to divide society. Religious leaders have an essential role in maintaining NKRI.

 

“Strengthening involves all elements of society, especially religious leaders, so that they guard and maintain the interpretation of religious values that are integrated for the love of NKRI,” he explained.
