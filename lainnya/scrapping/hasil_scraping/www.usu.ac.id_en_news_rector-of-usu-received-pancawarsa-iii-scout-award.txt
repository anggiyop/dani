The award was immediately pinned by the Governor of North Sumatra, Lt. Gen. TNI (Ret.)

"Yes, this is a motivation for us to make more efforts for this scouting to develop, starting from elementary school to university level," said Muryanto.

He also emphasized that scout education must be instilled in the younger generation so that they have a good personality.With scout education, the younger generation can havea strong leadership figure.

"Scouting education is very important, and I hope that we can develop scouts at USU again, we adjust it to fit the structure and expectations and achievements that we are targeting, so as to create a young generation of character," the USU Rector said.

In line with this, the Governor of North Sumatra, Lieutenant General TNI (Ret.)
