The USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said Polmed is USU's strategic partner, especially in meeting the needs of providing workshops or workshops for innovators to make prototypes of their findings.

USU PUBLIC RELATIONS - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Medan State Polytechnic (Polmed) collaborated in the Tri Dharma of Higher Education. As "nearest neighbors", the synergy of these two educational institutions continues to be improved.

The USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said Polmed is USU's strategic partner, especially in meeting the needs of providing workshops or workshops for innovators to make prototypes of their findings.

“So far it has actually been running, but we need to improve again. We are revitalizing the collaboration again so that the workshops at Polmed can be maximized for our innovators," said the Rector when entertaining Polmed Directors who had an audience with USU, Wednesday (9/29/2021).

In order to maximize it, the Rector asked the Dean of Engineering Dr. Fahmi to design collaboration with Polmed, especially in the use of Polmed workshops.

The Dean of USU Faculty of Engineering Dr. Fahmi, ST, MSc, IPM explained that so far the obstacle for our innovators is the availability of qualified workshops to make prototypes.

“This collaboration with Polmed will certainly increase USU's research and innovation. Actually, the USU Faculty of Engineering has been working together for a long time, but now we are revitalizing it so that the synergy between the two is more significant," he said.

Dr. Fahmi said the workshop or workshop at Polmed at this time is one of the workshops that is quite complete with equipment to support prototype making.

Director of Polmed Abdul Rahman, SE, Ak, M.Si., along with the ranks of the leadership welcomed the collaboration with USU. The arrival of Polmed to USU also asked for support for the transformation of Polmed which would change its status to a Public Service Agency (BLU).

"We hope that the Rector (Muryanto Amin) is willing to become the Polmed Supervisory Board, and asks USU for a written statement regarding support for the transformation of Polmed to BLU," he said.

Polmed itself is an educational institution that was originally born by USU. Until now, the land occupied by Polmed is still legally included in the USU area. On that occasion, the Rector expressed his full support for the transformation of Polmed to BLU.(©ULC)
