“We welcome all of you with pride and sincerity. Thank you also to the Government of North Nias Regency for the support and synergy that continues to exist,” said Vice Rector I USU.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) opened the Introduction to Campus Life for New Students (PKKMB) for the North Nias Regency Campus, Faculty of Agriculture. The event, which took place online through Zoom Meeting, was the first step for students of the 2024/2025 Academic Year to get to know the environment, facilities, and campus culture on Thursday (11/21/2024).

This year's PKKMB carries the theme “Embracing the Future Advancing Together”, which emphasizes the importance of adaptation to change, collaboration, and the spirit to advance together. On this occasion, USU Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, expressed pride in the enthusiasm of new students and expressed his appreciation for the close collaboration with the North Nias Regency Government.

“We welcome all of you with pride and sincerity. Thank you also to the Government of North Nias Regency for the support and synergy that continues to exist,” said Vice Rector I USU.

USU Vice Rector I emphasized USU's commitment to supporting the development of student character, skills and knowledge. By carrying the tagline “Transformation Towards the Ultimate”, the university strives to become one of the best universities and contribute to regional progress, especially North Nias Regency.

“At the North Nias Campus, you will be trained to think critically, creatively and innovatively. We believe the combination of knowledge, skills, and ethics will shape you into individuals who have a positive impact on society,” explained Dr. Edy.

Drs. Juliadi Zurdani Harahap, M.Si as the Regent of North Nias highlighted the importance of higher education in improving the quality of human resources (HR) in North Nias Regency. As a form of support, the North Nias Regency Government has covered 75% of the tuition fees at this campus.

“We hope that students can take advantage of this opportunity with sincerity to become agents of change,” hoped Drs. Juliadi.

The campus introduction session hosted by the Dean of the USU Faculty of Agriculture, Prof. Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana, M.S., became one of the important moments in PKKMB this time. Prof. Tavi introduced the Faculty of Agriculture as one of the leading faculties at USU with a focus on innovation in agrotechnology and aquatic resource management.

“The USU Faculty of Agriculture provides various study programs that are relevant to the needs of the times, especially to support the progress of the agricultural and marine sectors,” said Prof. Tavi.

The Chairperson of the PKKMB Committee, Dr. Lisnawita SP., M.Si. reported that in the 2024 academic year, the North Nias Regency Campus of the USU Faculty of Agriculture accepted 10 new students, consisting of 6 students in the Agrotechnology Study Program and 4 students in the Aquatic Resource Management Study Program.
