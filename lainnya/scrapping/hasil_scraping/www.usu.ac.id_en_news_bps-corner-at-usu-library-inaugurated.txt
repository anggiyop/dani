USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), together with the North Sumatra Statistics Agency, inaugurated the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) Corner at the Universitas Sumatera Utara Library Wednesday (25/01/2023).

The BPS Corner was inaugurated directly by the Vice Rector II for Finance and Human Resources, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., MSP, and the Head of the North Sumatra Statistics Agency, Nurul Hasanuddin, S. ST., M.Stat.

At the inauguration, WR II said the placement of the statistics corner in the library had many benefits. This is because students and lecturers need clear and accurate data.

Vice-Rector II also hopes that the University Library can socialize the Statistics Corner to students so that in the future, it can be used to access more valuable data, especially in writing theses.

"According to the Agency's Head, placing it in the library will have more benefits, especially in reaching students, and we hope the library will socialize this corner more. Vice-Rector II encouraged the faculties to allow these students access to this, so they can be close to the data and statistics and confidently write their thesis."

On the same occasion, the Head of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Library, Laila Hadri Nasution, S.Sos., MP, thanked the North Sumatra Central Bureau of Statistics for giving trust to the Universitas Sumatera Utara library as a distributor of information resource centers through the statistics corner.

The Head of the Library hopes that the collaboration will continue and the statistics corner will produce more positive things.

"Thank you to the Central Bureau of Statistics for giving trust in the usu library to provide this statistics corner in the USU library as an information resource center. So it feels right if these statistics are in the library. Currently, USU wants to increase the amount of research, so statistical data is needed to support research and community service because research activities, research results, and community service help improve university rankings and show that we are qualified, "said Laila.

The Head of the North Sumatra Central Bureau of Statistics, Nurul Hasanuddin, S. ST., M.Stat. hopes that the Statistics Corner can be utilized by students to support research, thesis writing, or related to supporting data from assignments given by lecturers.

"Of course, it will be more meaningful if it is utilized. So if it is just a display, that is not what we expect, ma'am. But of course, what we expect is how our students at Universitas Sumatera Utara, in particular, can optimize what is there so that statistical data can be used to support research, how to write a thesis, or related to supporting data from assignments given by lecturers," said Nurul.
