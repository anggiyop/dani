"Because we have only been working on it for one year, we will continue to monitor it in the future," said the Rector.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a meeting with the topic “Consolidation of Planning Program on 2022 and 2023” in the context of increasing the achievement of Key Performance Indicators (IKU) and International Accreditation as well as accelerating towards a World Class University (WCU).

The meeting, which stakeholders from all units and faculties attended, was held at the USU Auditorium on Tuesday (15/03/2022).

In his presentation, Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si said that the achievement of the IKU at USU has experienced significant growth. USU has also been ranked 10th out of 12 other PTN-BH.

"Because we have only been working on it for one year, we will continue to monitor it in the future," said the Rector.

The Rector targets USU to be in the top 5 KPIs of PTN-BH. Efforts to increase IKU will be carried out through program strengthening. According to him, the main focus at this time is IKU 2 regarding Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) and IKU 8 regarding international study programs.

"For MBKM, curriculum integration will be carried out, and curriculum learning methods will be adjusted. Then the study program w

ill also be accompanied to get international accreditation," he said.

Dr. Muryanto Amin also said that not only lecturers and education staff, students also played an important role in improving the KPI. Students can do this by participating in MBKM, diligently doing real community service, and filling out tracer studies after graduation.

"All programs made by the study program are important for students, and when they graduate, information about their work and income is immediately conveyed through tracer studies," he said.

As for World Class University, there will be organizational strengthening, program substance strengthening, and monitoring based on each achievement data.

This event was also filled with presentations by Germany's Country Representative of Senior Experten Service (SES) Adam Pamma with the topic "FIBAA International Accreditation" and the Head of the UGM Quality Assurance Office, Prof. Indra Wijaya Kusuma with the topic "Managing International Accreditation for Study Programs (Best Practice UGM)".
