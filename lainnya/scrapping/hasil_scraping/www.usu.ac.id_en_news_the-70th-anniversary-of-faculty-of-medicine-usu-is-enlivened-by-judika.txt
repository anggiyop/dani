“Each of each faculty we hope to compete and collaborate with each other. So don't prioritize the competition, but prioritize the collaboration," the USU Rector said.

USU PR- The Faculty of Medicine (FK) , Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a night of intimacy as the closing of a series of activities for the 70th USU FK Anniversary by presenting artists from the capital such as Judika and Nashwa. The Night of Familiarity which coincided with the 66th anniversary of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Obgyn) was held at the USU Auditorium on Sunday, (10/02/2022).

In his speech, the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that this event was a gathering place for the entire USU academic community. Although the Universitas Sumatera Utara has received excellent accreditation by BAN-PT, lecturers, students, education staff, and alumni must continue to improve the quality of higher education. Therefore, each faculty can collaborate with each other.

“Each of each faculty we hope to compete and collaborate with each other. So don't prioritize the competition, but prioritize the collaboration," the USU Rector said.

Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si hopes that many universities will get excellent accreditation so that the Indonesian generation can receive an equal education.

“We hope that many other universities will also get excellent results so that we can be the same, there are no more differences between one university and another. When these Indonesian children will get an education," the USU Rector added.

In commemorating the birthday of Prof. Dr. dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe, Sp.S(K) wants this event to further strengthen the relationship between the entire Faculty of Medicine USU academic community. And the Obgyn study program can grow and progress.

"I really hope this activity can increase intimacy among the academic community of the USU Faculty of Medicine," said the Dean of the faculty of medicine.

Vice Dean II of USU Faculty of Medicine Dr. dr. Muara P. Lubis, M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K) is very happy with the enthusiasm of the alumni who support and participate in this event. At the age of 70, USU's FK is expected to be more successful in the future.

"Hopefully the USU Faculty of Medicine will be even more victorious in the future and I salute the alumni who are so enthusiastic to donate and participate in this event, it's extraordinary," the Vice Dean II of the USU Faculty of Medicine said.

The chairman of the committee for the 70th USU FK Anniversary, Dr. dr. Johny Marpaung, M.Ked., Sp.OG also hopes that of course the USU Medical Faculty, especially the obgyn department, can produce obstetricians and midwives who are dedicated to the country.

"The more mature, the more victorious the obgyn will be in the future. More and more obstetricians and midwives are devoted to Indonesia," said the Head of the Obgyn Department. (©ULC)
