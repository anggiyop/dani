"Hopefully, these four renovated buildings can support all the needs for infrastructure at FEB USU, further increase the enthusiasm of students to learn, and optimize the performance of lecturers and staff to achieve the targets set in the faculty work program," he said.

PR USU - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S Sos., M.Si, inaugurated the four SKY buildings of the Faculty of Business Economics (FEB) on Friday (18/03/2022). The inaugurated four buildings were the Communal Space, Dean's Room, FEB Cafetaria and ASA Lounge.

The Rector of USU said that the renovation of several buildings at the Faculty of Business Economics aimed to support all the needs for facilities and infrastructure at USU's FEB.

"Hopefully, these four renovated buildings can support all the needs for infrastructure at FEB USU, further increase the enthusiasm of students to learn, and optimize the performance of lecturers and staff to achieve the targets set in the faculty work program," he said.

The operational inauguration of 4 buildings that have been renovated at FEB USU is in line with campus internalization efforts. As stated by Muryanto Amin, good facilities will support the creation of good and interesting work.

"So this is a support, if the room is nice and comfortable, the work people will be better and more attractive," said Muryanto Amin.

Muryanto Amin added that the benefits of holding facility improvements at USU's FEB will have an impact as a supporting element to boost USU's reputation and USU's efforts in its seriousness to meet the standards set a world-class university.

The four buildings that have been inaugurated have different functions. Communal Space is one of the learning areas in the form of an open learning space for students and the academic community to interact. Then there is the dean's room which has been converted into an expansion of the entrepreneurship study program.

The next place is the One-Stop Application Room or ASA LOUNGUE, an effort by the university leadership to simplify the bureaucratic process in administrative services to students. Then the last place is the cafeteria.

Dean of FEB Dr. Fadli S.E, M.Si appealed to students to be able to use the facilities well, take care of the facilities provided, and try to be disciplined so that all of them can enjoy the assets that have been given.

"We strive to be disciplined and take care of each other to enjoy this asset together and then develop it sustainably," said the Dean of FEB.

USU's FEB is one of the faculties that has received improvements in addition to FISIP, FMIPA, Faculty of Agriculture, and several other faculties.

The inauguration ceremony was attended by USU's Vice Rector, Deans and Deputy Deans of FEB, Chairs and Secretaries of Study Programs in the USU FEB environment.
