"Work with trust and full responsibility. Dean of the faculty is a position that requires commitment, sacrifice, hard work and great responsibility in its implementation, said the Rector.

USU PUBLIC RELATIONS - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) inaugurated the new Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry (FKG) in connection with the death of Prof. Dr. Trelia Boel, drg., M.Kes., Sp. RKG (K) who died early in his term of office.

Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin said that the entire USU academic community felt the loss of Prof Trelia's death and wished him the best place by his side.

To the new dean, Dr. Essie Octiara, drg, SpKGA, the Rector hopes to work optimally, especially encouraging campus internationalization.

"Work with trust and full responsibility. Dean of the faculty is a position that requires commitment, sacrifice, hard work and great responsibility in its implementation,” the Rector said.

The Rector asked the Dean of FKG to also spur the performance and achievements of the faculties, especially in achieving USU's main target, which is to become an international standard university.

“Surely this is not an easy task. Apart from requiring a common vision and mission as part of a large university team," he said.

It takes cooperation and commitment to devote full time, energy and thought to the management of the faculty so that it can achieve the highest level of performance and become a barometer of favorite dental education in Indonesia.

The Rector also advised Dr. Essie Octaria to build extensive networking, adaptive to technological advances.

"The success of the Merdeka Learning program at the Merdeka Campus, supports accreditation and contributes maximally to USU's ranking in various rating agency assessments, both on a national and international scale," he said.
