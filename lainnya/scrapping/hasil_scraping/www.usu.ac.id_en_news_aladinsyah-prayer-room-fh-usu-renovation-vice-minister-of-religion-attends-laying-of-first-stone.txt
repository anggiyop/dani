"We will rearrange the prayer room to be a friendly and productive space, where students can study, discuss, and even formulate academic strategies together," said Dr. Mahmul.

 

 

Public Relations USU—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) began renovating the Aladinsyah Prayer Room at the Faculty of Law (FH) by laying the first stone, which was carried out at the USU FH Pendopo. This event was also attended by the Deputy Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr. Kyai H. Romo Raden Muhammad Syafii, S.H., M.Hum, who is also an alumni of the USU FH. It took place on Tuesday (04/15/2025).

 

In his remarks, the Vice Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr. Kyai H. Romo Raden Muhammad Syafii, SH., conveyed an inspiring story about his struggles while studying at the USU FH. He clearly remembers the role of the Aladinsyah Prayer Room in shaping the character and spirituality of students.

 

"It was in this prayer room that I found the strength to survive, learn, and grow until I was finally able to graduate without repeating courses," he recalled.

 

On that occasion, the Deputy Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia symbolically handed over infaq assistance of IDR 100 million from the Indonesian Ministry of Religion to support the renovation process. He also signed the inauguration inscription and laid the first stone as a sign of the start of construction.

 

"Whoever builds a mosque for Allah, small or large, Allah will build for him a house in heaven," he said, quoting a hadith of the Prophet Muhammad SAW.

 

Vice Rector I of USU, Prof. Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH., MA.., emphasized preserving spiritual values in the academic environment. He said that the Aladinsyah Mosque has historical value for many alumni, witnessing the spiritual and intellectual journey of the USU FH academic community.

 

"This mosque is not only a place of prayer, but also where many stories begin, from mentoring to meeting one's soul mate. We want this legacy to live on and provide benefits," he said.

 

The Dean of the USU Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, SH., M.Hum., added that the Aladinsyah Mosque will be renovated into two floors that can accommodate worship activities and student academic activities. This renovation aims to revive the spirit of togetherness and the mosque's function as a center for student movement.

 

"We will reorganize the prayer room to become a friendly and productive space, a place where students can study, discuss, and even formulate academic strategies together," said Dr. Mahmul.

 

The committee Chairperson, Prof. Dr. Hasim Purba, SH., M.Hum., said that this renovation was initiated during the pandemic when the prayer room was no longer maintained. He said that in the future, the Aladinsyah Prayer Room will be designed to be more inclusive and become a center for religious activities and a space for student interaction.

 

"We want to make this prayer room not only a place of worship, but also a space for discussion and character building for students," explained Prof. Hasim.

 

The total funds collected for the renovation of the Aladinsyah Prayer Room have reached more than IDR 700 million, out of a total requirement of IDR 1.7 billion. The committee hopes that collaboration between alumni, academics, and the community will continue to complete this project.

 

This activity is an important momentum in revitalizing the function of places of worship as part of character building for students on campus. USU is committed to making the Aladinsyah Prayer Room an inclusive, productive, and spiritually valuable space for future generations.
