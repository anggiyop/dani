“As beings who are evolutionarily closely related to primates, we bear a great responsibility to preserve these species,” said Prof. Poppy.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara is hosting the 9th Asian Primate Symposium (APS) with the theme “Living in Harmony with Primates”. The event will be held from November 23-27.

The 9th Asian Symposium is routinely held every two years. This year, 20 country representatives participated.
