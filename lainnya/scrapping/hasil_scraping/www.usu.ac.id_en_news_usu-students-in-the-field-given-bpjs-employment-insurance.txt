According to the Rector, protection for students in the field is very necessary to keep students feeling safe and comfortable when carrying out their activities. Students who are interns are considered to be working so that USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., together with BPJS Ketenagakerjaan discussed a cooperation plan regarding BPJS insurance for students who are currently active in the field. The insurance is in the form of increased protection for students who are doing internships, KKN, or street vendors outside the campus.

According to the Rector, protection for students in the field is very necessary to keep students feeling safe and comfortable when carrying out their activities. Internship students are considered to be working so they must be protected.

"This protection is necessary so that if something goes wrong, students can be protected and their safety is guaranteed," said the Rector during a discussion with BPJS Employment staff at the Rector's Office, (10/27/2021).

Prior to conducting internships, students will be registered as BPJS Employment participants. This is a form of concern from the university and the government in protecting students who will be interns.

For students who are undergoing the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program, the amount of employment social security benefits will later be socialized directly to students during registration.

The Rector said that the university will discuss what programs can be taken after the BPJS sends a list of programs and their benefits. "The technical implementation will be discussed further," he said.

Deputy Director of the Regional BPJS Employment of Sumbagut Panji Wibisana said that apprentices will be given a Work Accident Insurance and Death Benefit program with a very small contribution of Rp 16,800.-/month.

"Participants will be protected when leaving for the internship, from the first activity to returning home," said Panji.

Not only that, USU and BPJS Employment will also carry out memorandums of understanding and cooperation agreements in other forms. "We will discuss what forms of cooperation can be done," he said.

Also accompanying the Rector in the meeting are Vice Rector II Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., MSP and Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Z Hasibuan. (©ULC)
