"Hopefully, all the efforts made by the Fasilkom TI Dean's Office to improve the quality of academic services at Fasilkom TI will yield good results through this accreditation," said Prof. Opim.

USU PR - The Assessment Team of the Information and Computer Accreditation Agency (LAM-INFOKOM) conducted a field assessment of the Undergraduate Information Technology Study Program, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (Fasilkom-TI), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). It took place in the Seminar Room of Building C Fasilkom TI USU on Friday (Mar. 8)

The Vice Rector for Information, Planning, and Development of USU, Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., representing the Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., welcomed the arrival of the assessment team from LAM-INFOKOM, namely Prof. Dr. Eri Prasetyo Wibowo, S.Si., M.M.S.I. from Universitas Gunadarma and Dr. Nur. Rokhman, S.Si., M.Kom. from Universitas Gadjah Mada.

"Allow me to express my gratitude and welcome to the LAM-INFOKOM Accreditation Assessment Team, who have kindly attended this field assessment activity," said Prof. Opim.

Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., also appreciated the entire performance of the Fasilkom TI Dean's Office, which has led Fasilkom to achieve several academic achievements, both within USU and in various national and international competitions. This is evidenced by achieving the IKU 7 award in the Collaborative and Participatory Class category in 2023.

"Hopefully, all the efforts made by the Fasilkom TI Dean's Office to improve the quality of academic services at Fasilkom TI will yield good results through this accreditation," said Prof. Opim.

Finally, closing his speech, Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., hoped that the good information, evaluation, and recommendations from the assessment team could strengthen the faculty's mission as a research-based higher education institution in the field of computer science/information and information technology that is adaptive, collaborative, and creative, and of international standard.

"We hope that through this assessment, the Undergraduate Program in Information Technology Study Program can successfully maintain its superior accreditation so that it can realize all its work programs, which align with the university's vision and mission," said Prof. Opim.

Dr. Maya Silvi Lydia, B.Sc., M.Sc., as the Dean of the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, expressed her commitment to improving the achievements and governance of the faculty and study program to maintain and improve superior accreditation. In this effort, collaboration with stakeholders is carried out in accordance with the tagline "Collaboration for Innovation."

"In preparing the documents that are the report for this field assessment, the challenge may be in the time it takes to complete the report," said Dr. Maya.

In the assessment conducted by (LAM-INFOKOM), the criteria for the success of a faculty or study program are emphasized on the planning, implementation, evaluation, and control of established policies. To that end, Prof. Dr. Eri Prasetyo Wibowo, S.Si, M.M.S.I, one of the assessors, stated that optimal results will be achieved if all criteria have met the superior standard.

"There are also nine criteria that the faculty or study program must meet, and the focus is on research and community service. This assessment is not to find mistakes but to improve the quality and correct existing shortcomings," said Prof. Eri.
