"With the existence of PPID, people who will submit requests for information are expected to be easier and less complicated because they are served through one door," said Prof. Fidel.

USU PR - Secretariat of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) through the Office of Protocol and Promotion Public Relations held a Socialization for Documentation Information Management Officers (PPID) at USU as an effort to increase user satisfaction with PPID services in public information service procedures. This socialization was held with the theme “Public Information Disclosure Creates Quality Information Services” through a zoom meeting, (08/12/2021).

USU Secretary Prof. Dr.dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), Sp.OG (K) said that the availability of information must be facilitated by appointed officials within USU so as to ensure the public to get the information needed quickly, transparently, accurately and accountably.

"With the existence of PPID, people who will submit requests for information are expected to be easier and less complicated because they are served through one door," said Prof. Fidel.

Prof. Fidel added that the provision of information and documentation was carried out by coordinating with all work units within USU as a source of information and documentation.

"In this case, the USU Public Relations, Protocol and Promotion Office acts as the manager of the USU PPID, which works under the instructions of the USU Secretary," he said.

According to him, well-organized information management will make it easier for PPID officials and officers to carry out all their duties.

"Guarantee the availability of information not only in the form of data that is managed regularly and efficiently, but also involves updating data in a disciplined manner so that all information provided remains up to date and supports the needs of the users of the information," said Prof. Fidel.

For information, the recognition of USU's PPID service standards this year received an increase in appreciation by winning the 2021 Public Information Openness Award for the Informative Predicate State Universities Category with a score of 91.23, where in the previous year (2020) it was only able to achieve the Informative Enough predicate.

Through this socialization, Prof. Fidel hopes that the quality of human resource competence in managing public information disclosure at USU can be improved.

"With the implementation of this socialization, we all hope that next year the achievement of USU's PPID service achievements can increase to be Very Informative," he said.

The activity, which was held via a zoom meeting, presented the Commissioner of the Central Information Commission Muhammad Syahyan who delivered the material "Public Information Disclosure Creates Quality Information Services" guided by the Head of the USU Protocol and Promotional Public Relations Office, Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., and a Psychologist as moderators.
