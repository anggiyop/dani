Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) signing the Free Campus Learning Cooperation Agreement with Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI) was marked at the Kick Off event held at Mandiri University, Medan, Tuesday (1/18/2022).

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) opened the year by collaborating with various parties. Recently, USU has agreed to cooperate with Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI). The agreement was marked at the Kick Off and Signing of the Independent Learning Cooperation Agreement at the USU-BSI Partner Independent Campus which was held at Mandiri University, Medan, Tuesday (1/18/2022).

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., witnessed the signing by the Dean of the USU Faculty of Economics and Business, the Dean of the USU Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, the Dean of the USU Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, the Dean of the USU Faculty of Agriculture, and representatives from the Faculty USU Law.

In his remarks, the Rector of USU appreciated BSI for the agreement that had been reached between the two agencies. He hopes that this collaboration can be beneficial for both parties, especially for USU students who will carry out the MBKM program.

"I would like to thank BSI for accepting and opening up to be able to cooperate with USU in the implementation of this MBKM. I hope that the 15 students who will start their activities here today will gain valuable knowledge and experience,” the USU Rector said.

Muryanto Amin said that learning to work is becoming a phenomenon among students. Many students are interested in improving their knowledge by participating in internships in various companies. Theoretically and practically educational collaboration is considered effective in increasing student understanding.

“Learning to work is now a trend. The reason is because as a student, working in a company there are no layoffs. In addition, learning to work also provides new experiences for students. If all this time they have only listened to lectures from lecturers in class, students will gain experience in facing real problems in the world of work,” he said.

The Rector of USU said that in the world of internships, the theoretical aspects are no longer as taught in class, but rather on how to implement SOPs. In addition, the knowledge they get is directly applied to solve problems.

“In my opinion, what students should achieve through the MBKM program are discipline, responsibility, and solutions. Students are a transition from the strict high school period with the rules of switching to the world of lectures. With the internship, they are taught to be disciplined. The results of that discipline will lead to a sense of responsibility. When it is ingrained, students can propose solutive innovations because they are done with themselves," Muryanto Amin explained.

He said that it is the obligation of universities to prepare students who are ready to work. This is a mandate from parents when sending their children to college.

Also attending the event were Regional CEO of BSI Region 2 Medan Kemas Erwan Husainy, Area Manager of Medan Raya BSI Puja Nur Arief, Regional Deputy of BSI Region 2 Medan Operation Deputy BSI, as well as Expert Staff of the Rector for Academic Affairs and Cooperation, Reni Asmara Ariga, S.KP, MARS, and Siti Salmiah, drg., Sp.KGA. (©ULC)
