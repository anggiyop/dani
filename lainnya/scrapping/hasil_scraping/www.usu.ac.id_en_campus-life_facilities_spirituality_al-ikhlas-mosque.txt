Al-Ikhlas Mosque

The Al-Ikhlas Mosque is located within the USU Faculty of Dentistry (FKG USU), right next to the USU Dental and Oral Hospital (RSGM USU). This mosque is accessible to both the USU academic community and the surrounding community during its opening hours. The mosque has a single floor but is quite spacious, making it comfortable for congregational prayers and daily worship. The Al-Ikhlas Mosque is also equipped with air conditioning and serves as the venue for Friday prayers every week.
