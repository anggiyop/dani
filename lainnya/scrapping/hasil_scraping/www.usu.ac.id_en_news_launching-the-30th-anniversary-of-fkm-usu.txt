Furthermore, the Dean of FKM USU hopes that the Faculty of Public Health will be more advanced and can achieve an international standard faculty considering that FKM USU has received the title of superior accreditation.

Chairman of the 30th Anniversary Committee of FKM USU, Dhani Syahputra Bukit SKM., MKM said that the competencies that students will get through activities such as community service and seminars are to gain the latest knowledge about digital health and apply public health sciences directly to community.
