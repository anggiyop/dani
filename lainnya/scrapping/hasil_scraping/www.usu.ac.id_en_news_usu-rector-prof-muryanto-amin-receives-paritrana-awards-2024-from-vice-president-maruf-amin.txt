“This award is a form of appreciation and motivation for USU to provide better employment protection and social security for the entire academic community within USU, said Prof. Mury after receiving the award Friday (13/09/2024).”

USU PR - Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., received the Paritrana Awards (Jamsostek Awards) 2024 National Level from Indonesian Vice President KH Ma'ruf Amin at BP Jamsostek Plaza Building, South Jakarta, Thursday (12/09/2024).

 

Together with Pj Governor of North Sumatra A Fatoni and Vice Regent of Simalungun Zonny Waldi, the USU Rector received the award directly from the Vice President who was also accompanied by the Coordinating Minister for PMK, Minister of Manpower, Managing Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of BPJS Ketenagakerjaan.

 

The Rector won the Paritrana award because he was considered committed to protecting workers in North Sumatra, especially in the education sector.

 

The award implemented by BPJS Ketenagakerjaan itself is a form of appreciation to parties who have successfully implemented labor social security protection for all workers in the region.

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, expressed his gratitude to Vice President Ma'ruf Amin together with the Coordinating Ministry for PMK and BPJS Ketenagakerjaan for appreciating USU regarding the implementation of employment social protection for USU academics.

 

“This award is a form of appreciation and motivation for USU to provide better employment protection and social security for the entire academic community within USU,” said Prof. Mury after receiving the award Friday (13/09/2024).

 

Prof. Mury explained, one of USU's commitments to provide comprehensive protection for USU citizens includes requiring the registration of students who take part in KKN in the BPJS Employment and Health program.

 

“Such programs will continue to be improved and become USU's commitment to provide employment, social security, and health social protection. Not only students but also USU lecturers and employees are ensured that all have been registered with BPJS Employment. This guarantee will certainly make lecturers and employees feel safe and comfortable in carrying out their tri-dharma tasks,” said Prof. Mury.

 

Indonesian Vice President Ma'ruf Amin previously said in his remarks that the government is strongly committed to realizing the Golden Indonesia 2045, with one of the development pillars focused on human development through labor reform. For this reason, the coverage of the Manpower Social Security program continues to be increased, with the hope that 99.5 percent of workers in Indonesia will be protected by 2045.

 

“The employment social security protection program is a tangible manifestation of the presence of the state in providing protection and welfare for workers and their families,” he said.

 

The award was also given to the North Sumatra Provincial Government for the Best Provincial Government Category. As for the Business Entity Category, besides USU, there is also the Al-Azhar Islamic Boarding School Foundation for the Education Foundation sector.
