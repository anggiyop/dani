“Many students think that the green building concept is a luxury building that only looks green, whereas, in reality it is not only that green building can be started from the use of building materials that are environmentally friendly," Rahmi Karolina explained.

Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Community Service Team, Introduction of the Green Building Concept to Build Gen Z Perceptions in Reducing Carbon Emissions, at SMA Negeri 1 Plus Matauli Pandan, Central Tapanuli, Saturday (1/8/2022).

In that activity, the team represented by Ir. Rahmi Karolina, S.T. M.T. Ir. M Agung Putra Handana, S.T. M.T., Emma Patricia Bangun, ST, M.Eng, Ph.D, DIC., Syarvina, ST, MT, Gea Geby Aurora Syafridon, ST, MT who is a teaching staff of the USU Civil Engineering Department gave an introduction to the concept of green building, namely the concept in which buildings in their design, construction and operation can reduce negative impacts on the environment.

“Many students think that the green building concept is a luxury building that only looks green, whereas, in reality it is not only that green building can be started from the use of building materials that are environmentally friendly," Rahmi Karolina explained.

She gave an example using materials that can reduce the use of cement in order to reduce carbon emissions in the construction activities of the building.

"In addition, we also introduce innovations that will be produced by Gen Z in the future while still supporting the government's commitment to reducing carbon emissions that have been compiled in the Nationally Determined Contribution or the so-called (NDC) signed in Paris in 2015 which states that Indonesia is able to reduce carbon emissions in 2030 by 29%," according to her.

As mentioned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), buildings contribute to 30% of the world's carbon emissions.

“Green building is made as much as possible in order to reduce existing carbon emissions. The USU Community Service Team hopes that Gen Z will be able to change perceptions and build innovations that continue to support the government's commitment to reducing carbon emissions, so that Indonesian construction can develop much better in the hands of the successors of the Indonesian nation," she concluded.(©ULC)
