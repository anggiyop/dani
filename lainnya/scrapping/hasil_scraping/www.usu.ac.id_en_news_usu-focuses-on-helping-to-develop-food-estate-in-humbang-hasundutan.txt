"USU will make research that can be used by the people of Humbang Hasundutan Regency, in particular we will concentrate on agriculture, especially the development of food estate in Humbang Hasundutan," the USU Rector said.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is collaborating with the Government of Humbang Hasundutan Regency to support food security programs through a food estate. The cooperation was stated in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), Wednesday (12/1/2021).

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said USU will focus on helping the Humbang Hasundutan Regency Government in the form of the Tridharma of Higher Education cooperation, namely research, education, and community service.

"USU will make research that can be used by the people of Humbang Hasundutan Regency, in particular we will concentrate on agriculture, especially the development of food estate in Humbang Hasundutan," the USU Rector said.

Regarding the food estate, the Rector said USU would be seriously involved in its development. USU will send service programs to Humbang Hasundutan Regency covering agriculture, health and social fields.

According to him, this collaboration requires the preparation of a thorough roadmap. “There will be a budget location that we will focus on. We need to develop a roadmap, so that the programs compiled are in line with the needs of the Humbang Hasundutan Regency Government, "explained Dr. Muryanto.

On the same occasion the Regent of Humbang Hasundutan Dosmar Banjarnahor, S.E said, agriculture in North Sumatra has great potential. "We must focus on developing agriculture in North Sumatra," he said.

Dosmar added that one of the efforts to develop a food estate in Humbang Hasundutan is through a scholarship program.

"Starting 2022, we will provide full scholarships for students from Humbang Hasundutan who study at universities with the best accreditation, including USU," he said.

Dosmar hopes that USU can be a driving force to develop community service, especially in the agricultural sector.

"USU can provide innovations in agriculture, to support the realization of Indonesia as a food barn," said Dosmar. (©ULC)
