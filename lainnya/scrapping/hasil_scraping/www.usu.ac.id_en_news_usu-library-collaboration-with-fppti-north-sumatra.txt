We are committed to maintaining the spirit and developing this forum," said Laila, who was recently appointed as Chair of FPPTI North Sumatra.

USU PR - The North Sumatra Regional Higher Education Library Forum (FPPTI-Sumut) in collaboration with Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Library held the Inauguration of the FPPTI-Sumut Management for the 2023-2026 period at the T. Amin Ridwan Multipurpose Building, USU Faculty of Cultural Sciences, on Tuesday (22/08/2023).

In his remarks, USU Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, explained that there are three meanings of the library. Starting from a monument to the history of civilization, a space for contemplation of the development of knowledge, to a symbol of national honor. According to him, the role of libraries will be long and functional for the culture of society.

"Its role, in my opinion, will be lasting and very functional for civilization," he explained.

WR I USU said FPPTI-Sumut should get strong support in terms of funding, especially to protect and complete the book collection. Therefore, library managers must be professional, disciplined, and love books.

"If the library is not managed by professionals who love books, it is very difficult," he said.

The Chairperson of the USU Library, Laila Hadri Nasution, S.Sos., M.P., expressed her gratitude for the support and trust given as the new Chairperson of FPPTI-Sumut for the 2023-2026 period.

"I would like to thank you for the support and trust given to me," he said.

Representing the board, he said he would be committed to maintaining the spirit of developing FPPTI-Sumut to become a more inclusive and productive environment. Currently, the number of FPPTI-Sumut members is 38 university libraries.

"We are committed to maintaining the spirit and developing this forum," he said.

Mariyah, S.Sos., M.Hum., as the Chairperson of the Central FPPTI expressed her hope for the newly appointed administrators, to be more trustworthy and able to make developments at the international level.

"We really hope that the new board can be more trustworthy," she said.
