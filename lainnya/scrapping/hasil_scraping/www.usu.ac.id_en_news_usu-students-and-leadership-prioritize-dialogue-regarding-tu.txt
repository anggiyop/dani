The peaceful and conducive expression of aspirations was directly responded to by the university's leadership, who engaged in a dialogue with the students regarding the increase in UKT.

USU PR—The student representative  from Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) visited the Rectorate Building of USU on Tuesday (May 8, 2024) to question the increase in the Single Tuition Fee (UKT) applied to new students for the academic year 2024.

The peaceful and conducive expression of aspirations was directly responded to by the university's leadership, who engaged in a dialogue with the students regarding the increase in UKT.

USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., represented by Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, M.A., accompanied by several vice rectors including Vice Rector II Dr. Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.S.P., and Vice Rector V Dr. Ir. Luhut Sihombing, M.P., along with the deans, explained to the students in the dialogue that the adjustment of UKT was in accordance with the regulations set by the Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Permendikbudristek) No. 2 of 2024.

"That regulation sets the amount of the Single Tuition Fee (BKT) or the Standard Unit Cost of State Higher Education. Through Permendikbudristek, the government regulates the value of UKT in state universities to have clear references and standards. Not only USU, but every state university is asked to develop and adjust the value of UKT according to the recommended BKT by the government," he said.

Based on the BKT set by the government, USU then made adjustments and consulted with the ministry. The ministry then verified the submitted proposal and approved it. It should be noted that out of the 30 study programs at USU, 4 programs had a decrease in the proposed BKT, while 3 programs had a decrease in the proposed highest UKT value.

"The adjustment of the UKT rate implemented by USU reflects the university's commitment to students' economic conditions. This can be seen from the number of students receiving UKT 1 and 2, whose tuition fees are only Rp500,000 and Rp1 million per semester, respectively. The same goes for the number of students receiving UKT 3, 4, and 5, whose tuition fees are the same as the average value of UKT KIP-K (government scholarships)," said Dr. Edy Ikhsan.

He also emphasized that there is no specific quota for students receiving UKT 1 to 5, meaning there are no limitations. The amount of UKT is solely based on the economic profile of the student's family or guardian.

"Based on this, the UKT system at USU is far from commercialization and is fair because there are lower UKT values with unchanged grouping procedures and without a maximum quota for UKT 1 to 5," he added.

"However, UKT 6, 7, and especially 8 have increased, and only 12.08% of new students who graduated from SNBP 2024 receive the full UKT (UKT 8). The determination of UKT is based on an assessment of the economic background of the student's family and is done through a multi-level and participatory verification process," he added.

The reasons behind the government's adjustment of BKT, which serves as the basis for adjusting UKT, are due to USU's significant progress. This can be seen from the development of the curriculum and the accreditation of study programs at USU, with an average score of A. Currently, only 15 study programs have a B accreditation.

"In the past three years, USU's reputation at the international level has also significantly increased, and USU will continue to commit to improving learning facilities and laboratories with the spirit of transformation towards the ultimate," said Dr. Edy Ikhsan.

He also added that USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin has signed and issued a Rector Regulation (Pertor) regarding the revision of UKT for students who feel burdened or wish to appeal regarding the amount of their UKT. Through this regulation, USU provides an opportunity for students or parents to consult regarding changes in UKT and to arrange installment payments.

"USU also provides a helpdesk at the Integrated Service Unit (ULT) on the 1st floor of the USU Rectorate Building, where students or parents can consult regarding UKT. The helpdesk is open every day and is intended to make USU's UKT policy more transparent and equitable," he concluded.

After receiving a comprehensive explanation from the university's leadership, the students peacefully dispersed. Security personnel continued to monitor the expression of aspirations until it was concluded and made sure that the students returned to their respective places.
