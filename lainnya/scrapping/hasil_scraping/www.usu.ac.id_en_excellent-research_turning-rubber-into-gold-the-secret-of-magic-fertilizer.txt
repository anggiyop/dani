This article discusses research on the optimal dosage of calcium, magnesium, and potassium fertilizers to increase latex yield in rubber plants. Discover how proper nutrient management can support the sustainability of the rubber industry and increase plantation productivity in Indonesia.

We are all familiar with rubber. This elastic material is an integral part of our lives, from car tires to rubber bands. However, have you ever wondered how this rubber is produced? Behind the rubber products we use daily, there are vast rubber plantations, especially in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. Amid the challenges of climate change and increasing global demand, rubber farmers are required to boost productivity without harming the environment. One of the key factors is soil nutrition. Rubber plants, like other living organisms, need nourishment to grow healthy and productive. However, feeding rubber plants is not as simple as just watering them. It involves the complex science of soil nutrition and proper fertilization.

In the global rubber industry, the productivity of rubber plantations heavily depends on effective nutrient management. One of the key aspects of improving latex yield is ensuring the right balance of nutrients in the soil. Recent research conducted by Irwan Agusnu Putra, Hamidah Hanum, Radite Tistama, and Edison Purba in Dolok Masihul, Serdang Bedagai Regency, North Sumatra, Indonesia, highlights the importance of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) fertilizer doses for achieving optimal latex yield.

The study, which took place from January to August 2019, aimed to determine the optimal doses of calcium, magnesium, and potassium fertilizers in relation to cation-base ratios (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺) to enhance latex yield in rubber plants. By understanding the correct doses, it is hoped that rubber plant productivity can be increased and the sustainability of the rubber industry in the region can be supported. The research was conducted in three replicates to ensure accurate and consistent results. Each factor was applied at varying doses to evaluate its impact on latex yield and the cation content in soil, leaves, and latex.

Before applying fertilizers, soil analysis showed several deficiencies that needed addressing. The soil had low nitrogen (N) levels, acidic pH, and very high phosphorus (P) content, but low total phosphorus. "The cation exchange capacity (CEC) was also low, with moderate potassium levels and very low calcium and magnesium levels. This data indicates that the soil needs additional calcium, magnesium, and potassium to support optimal rubber plant growth," said Irwan Agusnu Putra.

The research results indicate that applying calcium at a dose of 1,500 grams per tree per year significantly increased magnesium content in latex and latex yield, with an additional 160.70 grams per tree per tapping. This shows that calcium not only improves soil nutrient balance but also plays a direct role in enhancing the quality and quantity of latex produced. Meanwhile, adding magnesium at doses of 1,500 to 4,500 grams per tree per year significantly increased cation levels in soil, leaves, and latex. Magnesium plays a crucial role in improving nutrient balance and supporting optimal latex production. Higher magnesium levels in latex suggest that magnesium contributes to better latex quality.

"Potassium, with doses ranging from 500 to 1,500 grams per tree per year, was shown to increase calcium levels in leaves and cation levels in latex. Potassium is essential for various physiological functions of the plant, including latex formation. The increase in potassium levels in latex indicates that potassium contributes to higher latex quality," added Irwan Agusnu Putra.

Interactions between 1,500 grams of calcium, 1,500 to 4,500 grams of magnesium, and 0 to 1,500 grams of potassium per tree per year showed significant improvements in potassium exchange rates, magnesium content in latex, and magnesium and potassium levels in leaves. The optimal ratios found were 2:1:2 for soil, 5:1:11 for leaves, and 1:11:32 for latex. This ratio indicates that the correct balance among these three elements is crucial for enhancing latex yield.

Irwan Agusnu Putra explained that correlation analysis showed that calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels in leaves and potassium levels in latex had a positive relationship with latex yield. This confirms that balanced nutrition and the correct fertilizer doses can significantly improve harvest results. Proper nutrient balance supports plant health and increases latex production capacity.

This research identifies the optimal doses of calcium, magnesium, and potassium fertilizers to improve latex yield in rubber plants. Applying fertilizers at the right doses improves cation balance in soil, leaves, and latex, and supports better harvest outcomes. These findings provide practical guidance for rubber farmers to manage their plant nutrition more effectively.

In facing challenges in the rubber industry, such as climate change and market fluctuations, efficient nutrient management becomes key to sustainability. By understanding plant nutrient needs and applying the right fertilization strategies, farmers can maximize their latex yield and support the sustainability of the rubber industry.

Maintaining nutrient balance in the soil is a crucial step to improving rubber plant harvests. This study offers valuable insights into optimizing the use of calcium, magnesium, and potassium fertilizers to achieve maximum latex yield. With the knowledge gained from this research, rubber farmers can better tackle industry challenges and ensure a brighter future for their rubber plantations.

With proper fertilization strategies and effective nutrient management, the rubber industry can not only meet market demands but also contribute to environmental and economic sustainability. In the future, innovations in nutrient management and agricultural technology will continue to play a significant role in enhancing productivity and sustainability in the rubber industry.
