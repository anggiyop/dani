USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si in his remarks said that this public lecture forum can add insight from the speakers related to the themes discussed. In addition, it is also as a forum for constructive discussion related to the future of Indonesia in the midst of the dynamics of change that is happening in the world.

"This forum can be an important medium for all of us, especially the law students who attend, to add insight from the speakers," the USU Rector said.

According to the USU Rector, the theme raised in this public lecture is the authority of citizens to discuss the constitution because it is part of state civilization to discuss matters relating to the foundation of the state.

The Rector also mentioned that later the participants will continue to provide analysis, views, and conduct research related to the theme "Reconstruction of the Special Authority of the Legislative Institution in Indonesia through Amendments to the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia".

"We still have to provide analysis, views because many are doing research on it," he said.

The chairman of the DPD (Regional House of Representative) RI, AA LaNyalla Mahmud Mattalitti explained, the theme raised in this public lecture was based on the topic of the role of the DPD in Indonesia. In addition, DPD RI directly asked students' thoughts on the reconstruction of the special role and special authority of the legislature.

"DPD thinks that the material specifically is more appropriate to be delivered at USU's FH," he said.

The Dean of USU's Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum said students should be able to conduct studies and express aspirations related to the theme raised.

"We hope students make this meeting, this discussion to deepen studies again, to conduct research and scientific works," he said. (©ULC)
