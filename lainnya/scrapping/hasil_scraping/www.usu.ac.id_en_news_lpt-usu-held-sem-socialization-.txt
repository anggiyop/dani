“Hopefully, this can add to our treasures and knowledge in material characteristics. For example, he said that we at the Integrated Laboratory UPT have a SIM device with the TM code 3000 from the Hitachi brand with a magnification of 5000 times, "he said.

USU PR – Technical Service Unit (UPT) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Integrated Research Laboratory (LPT) held the 9th webinar series, which was packaged with the title 'Introduction to Scanning Electron Microscope and It's Application'. The event took place online via Zoom Meeting on Thursday (09/06/2022).

Head of USU's LPT, Ir. Rahmi Karolina, S.T., M.T., IPM. said that this event is expected to add to the treasures and knowledge of webinar participants, especially in material characteristics.

Before officially opening the event, the Head of USU's LPT also mentioned that currently USU's LPT has a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with the code TM 3000 from the Hitachi brand whose magnification reaches 5000 times.

“Hopefully, this can add to our treasures and knowledge in material characteristics. For example, we at the Integrated Laboratory UPT have a SIM device with the TM code 3000, yes, from the Hitachi brand with a magnification of 5000 times, "he said.

On the same occasion, Applicant Specialist PT. Dynatech Rani Deliana Pangabean, M.Sc. as a speaker and a specialist in the use of SEM tools, explained that SEM is a type of microscope that is usually used to image the surface of a material or material being tested. So it can produce a magnification resolution much better than ordinary microscopes.

“The electron microscope is the type of electron that we usually use to image the surface of a material or material. So we get a much better magnification or resolution than an ordinary microscope," he said.

In addition, he also added that there is some information that can be obtained using the microscope, including information related to the morphology of the material being studied, topography, and the composition of elements contained in the samples being tested.

"Information obtained from this microscope is information related to morphology, from the material we are testing, then its topography, and also the composition of elements or elements contained in the material or sample we are testing," explained Rani Deliana.

For information, this seminar was attended by researchers and students from many regions.
