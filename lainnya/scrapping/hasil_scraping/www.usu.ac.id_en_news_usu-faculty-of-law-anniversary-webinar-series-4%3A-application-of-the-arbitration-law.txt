"Arbitration is a dispute resolution model out of court and is basically the most appropriate format for resolving economic and business disputes," said the dean.

USU PR - The Faculty of Law (FH) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) again held the Scientific Week of Webinar Series 4 Legal Reflections with the theme "Implementation of the Arbitration Law in the Perspective of Higher Education." The webinar was held via Zoom meeting on Thursday (1/20/2022).

The Dean of USU's Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum. explained that conceptually, arbitration has a number of advantages compared to dispute resolution through formal courts established by the state and government.

"Arbitration is a dispute resolution model out of court and is basically the most appropriate format for resolving economic and business disputes," said the dean.

The Dean added, in enforcing the law on arbitration and alternative dispute resolution, there are many lessons and criticisms to make reforms. Thus, alternative arbitration can be more efficient and effective in providing benefits to the business world.

"Futhermore, currently we are facing a very strong information age, disruption in various fields, and fast business development, so we need to perfect and review various very important things," he continued.

According to Dr. Mahmul, an ineffective arbitration institution can create chaos and affect a country's country risk, because one of the indicators for the assessment of international institutions is disputes in business.

"It also affects the ability to make economic improvements because the investment climate is not improving," he said.

He added that universities, especially the USU Faculty of Law, felt an interest in providing input and contributing ideas to create better benefits in the application of arbitration.

"Community development certainly requires various responses in the form of ideas for improving existing legal instruments regarding arbitration," he said. (ULC)
