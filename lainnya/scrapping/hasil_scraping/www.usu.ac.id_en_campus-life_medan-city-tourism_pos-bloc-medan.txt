Pos Bloc Medan

Pos Bloc Medan is a public creative space that underwent renovation for more than six months. The collaboration between PT Pos Properti Indonesia and PT Ruang Kreatif Pos successfully transformed the 111-year-old Medan Post Office Building into a multi-functional creative hub that attracts various creative communities. Pos Bloc Medan offers an area protected as a Cultural Heritage Building, becoming home to a variety of SME/UMKM tenants in creative industries such as culinary, music, film, fashion, and craft. Well-known tenants such as Gelato Secrets, Nelayan, Common Folks, and others have opened their businesses at Pos Bloc Medan. In addition, there are also non-F&B tenants such as Photomatics and GrowLiving.co. This creative space has various interesting facilities such as Esplanade, De Boer (open area), Maidan Hall (amphitheater), Rotunda (main hall), Park, and Museum Pos Gallery. The building has become one of Medan's landmarks and has unique architecture blending European style and local character. Pos Bloc Medan is expected to be a place that supports MSMEs and young people's creativity. The Minister of Cooperatives and SMEs, Teten Masduki, hopes Pos Bloc Medan will become an icon of the city and help improve MSME products. The Mayor of Medan, Muhammad Bobby Afif Nasution, S.E., M.M., and the President Director of PT Pos Indonesia (Persero), Faizal Rochmad Djoemadi, are also committed to supporting the growth of MSMEs and reviving the economy in Medan city. Pos Bloc Medan is part of the M Bloc Group that has successfully created public creative spaces such as M Bloc Space in Jakarta, Pos Bloc Jakarta in Pasar Baru, JNM Bloc in Yogyakarta, and Fabriek Bloc in Padang. The existence of Pos Bloc Medan is a real effort to encourage the creative economy, empower MSMEs, and utilize space effectively.
