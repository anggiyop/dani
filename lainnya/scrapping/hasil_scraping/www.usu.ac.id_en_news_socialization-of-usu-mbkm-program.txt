"So this year, especially for the 2023/2024 school year, which will begin in this odd semester on August 21. We hope that our target is around 800-900 USU students who will participate in the USU partnership teaching campus program," said Vice Rector 1 USU.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the Socialization of the USU Partner Teaching Campus Program. This activity took place on Wednesday (09/08/2023).

This socialization is a form of the Teaching Campus program which is carried out independently by USU with several foundations, pesantren, or schools that have collaborated.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., as Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, said that the Teaching Campus for USU Partners, which was held, was an independent activity carried out by the University. Later, it will open opportunities for students to take part in the teaching program.

“Well, the teaching campus is an activity that is held once a year by the Ministry. And there is also by USU. The point is that there is Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka, which was initiated by the Ministry, and now it already exists. And it's a competition, not all students who register pass. Now, the Universitas Sumatera Utara also does that because it is a shame if there are students who really want to devote themselves to schools or Islamic boarding schools with the knowledge they have,” he explained.

Vice Rector I added that this program will be implemented for one full semester. This activity was attended by 800 students, and began in the odd semester on August 21 for the 2023/2024 academic year.

“So this year, especially for the 2023/2024 academic year, which will begin in this odd semester on August 21. We hope that our target is around 800-900 USU students who will take part in the USU partnership teaching campus program,” he explained.

Furthermore, Vice Rector I said that the USU Partner Teaching Campus is an event for students who have an interest in teaching and sharing knowledge with students in school. This is also a place to develop skills and competencies.

“Here students who have a passion for teaching, this is an opportunity for them to transform their knowledge to their younger siblings who are currently at the junior high school level and also in pesantren. Thus, it will increase their skills and competencies, their soft and hard skills in the knowledge they have,” he explained.
