Kesawan Square

Kesawan Square, a familiar place for residents of Medan City, is a special area at the city center. Showcasing architecture that dates back to the colonial era, it has been transformed into an alluring tourist destination of the Old Town of Medan. Located on Jalan Ahmad Yani, Kecamatan Medan Barat, Kesawan Square is a lively street, especially at night, with street vendors and food stalls lining the streets. Over the past few years, Kesawan Square has become a popular spot among young people as a weekend tourist center. In 2021, the Mayor of Medan, Bobby, officially launched this site as the center of Medan's culinary tourism, nicknamed "The Kitchen of Asia". For students of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), especially those from Medan City, Kesawan Square is the perfect place to spend the weekend with their friends, offering fun entertainment after a whole week of lecture activities.
