"Earlier we reviewed several locations, how they were implemented, what were the obstacles. It turned out that from the locations reviewed, everything went smoothly. The committee also reported that the network (internet connection) was secure," said the Rector while reviewing the exam locations, Tuesday (726/2022).

PR USU - Unversitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has successfully held the Independent Entrance Selection (SMM) and Diploma Program Admission Selection (SPMPD) 2022. USU leaders who directly oversee the implementation of the exam in several locations such as the Faculty of Computer Science, Nursing and the Faculty of Agriculture ensure the exam going on smoothly.

USU Rector Dr Muryanto Amin, SSos, MSi emphasized that the selection committee had prepared a comfortable room and adequate network availability to ensure that the exam participants were well facilitated.

"So earlier we reviewed several locations, how they were implemented, what were the obstacles. It turned out that from the locations reviewed, everything went smoothly. The committee also reported that the network (internet connection) was secure," said the Rector while reviewing the exam locations, Tuesday (7/26/2022).

The Rector explained, for this year, 7,768 participants registered for the SMM pathway, with details choosing the category of IPA 4,296, IPS 2,833 and IPC 639. Meanwhile for SPMPD there were 609 with details choosing the categories of IPA (Science) 212, IPS (Social) 337 and IPC (mix) 60.

"The total is 8,377. Meanwhile, our capacity of this year specifically for SMM is 2,452 and SPMPD 1,271, so the total quota for SMM and SPMPD are 3,723 seats," he said.

The Rector emphasized that the examination itself was carried out in several sessions starting on July 25 - 31, 2022. The committee prepared 50 rooms in 13 points. "This independent exam and diploma is the last entry point to state universities. Previously there were SNMPTN, SBMPTN and this year there was an achievement path," he said.

The achievement path itself, added the Rector, has been running with around 200 people participating, but those who have passed the 11 selection. Meanwhile, the announcement of the SMM exam is scheduled for August 7, 2022 and SPMPD August 11, 2022 on the usu.ac.id page.

Accompanied by the Chairman of the Selection Committee who is also Vice Rector I Dr Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, Vice Rector II Muhammad Arifin Nasution, SSos, MSP, Vice Rector IV Prof. Opim Salim Sitompul, Vice Rector V Ir Luhut Sihombing, MP and Director of the Directorate of SMM Education Development and SPMPD Dr Anggia Muchtar, ST, MMIT, rector emphasized that the exams still pay attention to the Covid-19 health protocol.

On the same occasion, the Rector of USU also said that the inaugural lecture for new students would be held face-to-face. The university is currently preparing to welcome new students and the regulation of face-to-face lectures is 100 percent.

"If we look at the current conditions, it is very possible to hold face-to-face lectures. Hopefully the Covid-19 numbers will no longer spike so that our plan to make face-to-face lectures 100 percent is not hampered," he said. (©ULC)
