“Hopefully, we can make good use of this opportunity to explore useful information, to improve our insight and competence, and this can also be a positive thing for the development of USU,” said Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., M.T.

 

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), together with the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) held a public lecture entitled “Energy Transition to Inhibit Global Warming and Climate Change Disasters” with guest speaker Prof. Ir. Yohannes Sardjono, Principal Expert Researcher at BRIN's Nuclear Safety, Metrology and Quality Technology Research Center. The activity occurred in the Senate Meeting Room, Third Floor USU, on Monday (24/02/2025).

 

This public lecture aims to increase understanding of the importance of energy transition in addressing climate change and global warming, as well as being an opportunity for collaboration in developing innovative solutions for the future.

 

Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., M.T., USU's Director of Internationalization and Global Partnerships, expressed his appreciation for BRIN's presence in his remarks and hoped that students could utilize research collaboration opportunities and scholarships from BRIN and also have a positive impact on USU's development. 

“Hopefully, we can make good use of this opportunity to explore useful information, to improve our insight and competence, and this can also be a positive thing for the development of USU,” said Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., M.T.

 

In line with that, Arif Nuryawan, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Forestry USU, revealed that the collaboration between USU and BRIN has been established for a long time. Last year, USU was ranked 12th as BRIN's main collaborator. Arif Nuryawan, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D., hopes this achievement can be maintained or improved.

“USU and BRIN have been collaborating for a long time. This can be maintained or improved because the only universities outside Java are USU and UNHAS,” said Arif Nuryawan, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D.

 

Dr. Eng. Ir. Taufiq Bin Nur S.T., M.Eng.Sc., a USU Mechanical Engineering lecturer who served as moderator this time, mentioned the need to develop a curriculum that discusses climate change, energy transition, and the use of new and renewable energy so that students are encouraged to conduct research in these fields. Dr. Eng. Ir. Taufiq Bin Nur S.T., M.Eng.Sc. also hoped there would be a continuous collaboration with experts and students to develop research that benefits society.

“From our side, lecturers must provide input or curriculum regarding deeply dynamic matters so that students will get a lot of information and there is research. I hope, like Prof. Yohannes, he often comes here to provide input, and in the future, we can continue to collaborate to benefit the community,” said Dr. Eng. Ir. Taufiq Bin Nur S.T., M.Eng.Sc.

 

As a resource person, Prof. Ir. Yohannes Sardjono explained that BRIN now prioritizes collaboration and said that it is his duty as a principal investigator to foster cooperation between universities and industries in applying BRIN's research results. Furthermore, Prof. Yohannes Sardjono mentioned a Degree by Research (DbR) program for students funded by BRIN.

“As a researcher and the main research expert, BRIN has assigned me the task of fostering relationships between universities or industries to collaborate and apply research results at BRIN. There is a DbR program for students, namely Degree by Research, funded by BRIN. Hopefully USU can cooperate in the future, we believe USU is capable,” explained Prof. Ir. Yohannes Sardjono.
