Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, MA said the activity in the form of a workshop was intended to assist USU in designing MKWK learning that was fun for students and had an impact on the development of students' skills and character.

USU PR - The Directorate of Learning and Student Affairs (Belmawa) Higher Education (Dikti) team provided assistance to lecturers at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) to design compulsory courses in the Higher Education Curriculum (MKWK) which consisted of Religion, Pancasila courses, Citizenship and Indonesian for two days, Monday-Tuesday (11/8-9/2021).

Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, MA said the activity in the form of a workshop was intended to assist USU in designing MKWK learning that was fun for students and had an impact on the development of students' skills and character.

"The framework used in project-based learning is the "Design Thinking" framework in which the role of the lecturer is very important to be a facilitator and friend of thought for students at every stage and help students see a problem from various perspectives," he said.

VR 1 explained, to implement it, full support from universities is needed, collaboration and openness between course lecturers to work together so that students get the best experience in the learning process.

Expert Staff of the Rector for Academic Affairs Reni Asmara Ariga, SKp, Mars added, MKWK which consists of Pancasila, Civics, Indonesian Language, and Religion is a course taken by all students throughout Indonesia.

"Therefore, this course is strategic to become a training medium for students to strengthen the character of Pancasila and practice its values ​​while learning to find solutions to surrounding problems and honing various skills needed in the 21st Century," she said.

She explained that Indonesia is preparing itself to face the 2030 demographic bonus. Meanwhile, changes are happening so fast that it is difficult to predict what environmental problems, professional needs, technology and other fields will be faced by Indonesia and the world. Therefore, universities are preparing students to become graduates who are adaptive, flexible and competitive with the Pancasila character.

Reni Asmara explained that the number of lecturers at USU involved in this activity were 30 lecturers of USU MKWK/USU LIDA courses. The Belmawa team that attended included Dwi Purnomo (Unpad Lecturer), Ran Hara Permana (Unpad Lecturer), Fariz Prima Fadhila (Unpad Lecturer), Praditya Cahyanto (Dit. Belmawa) and Aprias Nindi Saputri (Dit Belmawa). (©ULC)
