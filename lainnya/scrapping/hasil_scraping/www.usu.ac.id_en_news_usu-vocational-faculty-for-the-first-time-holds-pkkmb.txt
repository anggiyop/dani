Prof. Isfenti Sadalia explained that this faculty will apply 70% of practice and 30% of theory. So that this faculty combines a diploma study program consisting of the fields of social and human rights and science and technology.

The Faculty of Vocational Studies at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) for the first time held a PKKMB. The Vocational Faculty, which consists of 14 diploma majors, held the PKKMB in the Vocational Faculty Building, which was formerly the USU Faculty of Forestry. This faculty itself was only established on June 27, 2022.

"So if you say it's only been 2 months, then it's only been 2 months that the Rector has issued a decree," said Acting Dean of the USU Faculty of Vocational Studies, Prof. Dr. Isfenti Sadalia, SE, ME

One of the interesting things about the PKKMB of the Vocational Faculty is the scarf attribute worn by new students of the Vocational Faculty which consists of several colors. These colors are a combination of the colors of the faculties from the diploma major, namely FIB, FEB, FISIP, FMIPA, and Pharmacy. The total number of Vocational Faculty students is 1,200, so this number makes the Vocational Faculty the faculty with the most PKKMB participants at USU. (

PKKMB FISIP

While at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) PKKMB was attended by students from 7 Study Programs. Dean of FISIP Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., MSP explained that the PKKMB which took place at FISIP still followed the health protocol. Later, the requirements that must be met by FISIP students attending offline lectures are that they have received at least two vaccine doses.

The Dean of FISIP hopes that by holding this PKKMB, new students can get to know the campus well and can understand how later they can participate in improving academic and non-academic achievements. (©ULC)
