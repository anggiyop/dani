About MEPRO USU Student Activity Unit

MEPRO USU is a student activity unit that has been established since 2008. This student activity unit serves as a platform for the development of management, organizing, and communication skills among USU students. As an organization actively involved in event organizing, MEPRO USU has repeatedly collaborated with various media partners, institutions, and event organizers. Most recently, in 2023, this student activity unit organized the Duta Pelajar Sumatera Utara 2023 event. MEPRO USU also offers its members valuable skills acquired through their involvement in the student activity unit, such as multitasking, problem sensitivity, time management, negotiation, and creativity. Therefore, MEPRO USU is the right choice for USU students who want to apply their creativity to event organization.
