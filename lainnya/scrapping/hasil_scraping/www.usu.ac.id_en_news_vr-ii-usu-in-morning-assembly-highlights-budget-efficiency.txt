“So efficiency is to make savings that have usually been used, for example yesterday electricity, water. For example, with the working hours that are carried out, 16:30 is finished, so the use of electricity will be minimal,” said VR II USU.

 

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) conducts a routine Apel every Monday morning, led by Dr. Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP. who serves as Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance. This apple discusses work time in line with budget efficiency, including operational and non-operational expenditures. It was held at the USU Rectorate Bureau Page, on Monday (17/02/2025).

These two regulations have been stated regarding the hours of entry, rest hours, and working hours every day.
