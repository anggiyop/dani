Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Soc., M.Si., Rector of USU, welcomed the arrival of the PANTARLIH officers and expressed his full support to the 2024 Election organizer's work. The USU Rector also asked the PANTARLIH officers in Medan Sunggal Subdistrict about the socialization pattern implemented so that all residents of Tanjung Rejo Village in the Medan Sunggal Subdistrict were accurately recorded.

USU PR: The Voter Registration Officer or Petugas Pendaftaran Pemilih (PANTARLIH), accompanied by the General Election Commission (KPU) of Medan, conducted matching and research (Coklit) at the private residence of the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in the Medan Sunggal District on Friday (10/3/2023).

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Soc., M.Si., Rector of USU, greeted the presence of the PANTARLIH officers and expressed his complete support for the 2024 Election organizer's efforts. The USU Chancellor also questioned the PANTARLIH personnel in Medan Sunggal Subdistrict about the socialization pattern used so that all residents of Tanjung Rejo Village in the Medan Sunggal Subdistrict are accurately recorded.

"Take care of your health because the 2024 Election stage is still pretty long," he instructed the PANTARLIH officer who registered the family of the USU Rector.

In the presence of Medan KPU Chairman Agussyah R. Damanik and other KPU members, including Nana Miranti and Edy Suhartono, the Rector expressed his optimism that the 2024 Election would proceed according to the established schedule.

Febriza, a Medan Sunggal District Election Committee (PPK) member, praised the USU Rector's support, making it easier for PANTARLIH officers to collect and match data.

"Indeed, this stage is currently being executed. The Rector encourages and supports us to carry out our responsibilities effectively so that the Coklit stage works smoothly, "he remarked.

According to Febriza, Coklit is conducted to verify paper-based voter registration records. "After data gathering and comparison, we sign the minutes maintained by both parties," he explained.

Febriza revealed that the purpose of the coming of the Medan Sunggal Sub-district PANTARLIH official, accompanied by three KPU Medan Commissioners, was to verify the data and meet with Prof. Mary, who had recently been appointed Professor of Political Science at USU.
