PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Ministry of Education and Technology discussed Increasing Understanding of the Integrity Zone of Corruption-Free Regions and Clean Serving Bureaucratic Areas (ZI WBK and WBBM) within USU. This event took place in the Academic Senate Room of the USU Central Bureau Building on Tuesday, (24/05/2022).

In his remarks, USU's Vice-Rector II, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP stated that ZI is one of the important requirements in producing superior and competitive human resources. High integrity is required to achieve this.

"It takes high integrity and is supported by three main targets, namely a clean bureaucracy, a capable bureaucracy, and a bureaucracy with excellent public services," said VR II.

VR II also explained that bureaucratic reform in higher education institutions is an important and urgent need to be implemented immediately in order to ensure the availability and implementation of excellent public services, as well as realizing good governance.

"To do this and get the desired results, of course it is not enough just to have intentions, but also to be followed by a strong will. The same mindset and action should be applied at all levels leaders, highest to the lowest, and at all levels. All lecturers and education staff," he said.

Arifin Nasution also hopes that the process will run well to produce good service to stakeholders. In addition, he advised to be responsible for providing the best service for the academic community.

On the same occasion, the Inspector General (Irjen) of the Ministry of Education and Culture Research and Technology RI, Dr Chatarina Muliana, SH, SE, MH who was directly present at the event stated that there are two criteria that can be implemented in ZI WBK and WBBM including exemplary leadership and commitment to the whole team.

“The first is the example of leadership. The leader must be a role model. Second, build commitment with the whole team. Currently at USU, represented by the faculty of nursing. How to build leadership in the Faculty of Nursing, how that commitment can build a transformation in service," explained the Inspector General of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia.

Dr. Chatarina also explained that the determination process will be carried out until 2024. So, those who pass were advised to be reviewed again. Those who have not proposed could be added what faculties will be designated as ZI WBK and WBBM.

"Yes, if the determination process will be carried out until 2024. For those who have not passed can do a review again. For those who have not proposed please add what faculties are designated as ZI WBK and WBBM, "he said.

For information, USU represented by the Faculty of Nursing has succeeded in getting the ZI-WBK predicate from the Ministry of Education and Culture for two consecutive years (2021 and 2022).
