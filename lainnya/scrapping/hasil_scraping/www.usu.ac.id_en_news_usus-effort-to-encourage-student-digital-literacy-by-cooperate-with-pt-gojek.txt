USU and PT. Gojek Indonesia officially signed a Cooperation Agreement on Friday (10/12/2023) in the USU BPA Lobby. In this event the inauguration of the Gojek shelter was also held.

This cooperation agreement is a form of unification between the world of industry and the world of education. The collaborative program that has been prepared will follow the learning curriculum of all study programs at the University of North Sumatra. The purpose of cooperation with PT. Gojek is none other than to encourage digital literacy for USU students.

Reporting from officialusu.ac.id, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin., S.Sos., M.Si said that students need to get training and deepen their skills before going into the industrial world later. Therefore, USU is trying to design a collaborative research program as a step to strengthen student readiness in the industrial world. (SS)
