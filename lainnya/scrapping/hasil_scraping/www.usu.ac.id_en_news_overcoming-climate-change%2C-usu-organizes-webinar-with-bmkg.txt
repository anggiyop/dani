"This is to prepare for the webinar between BMKG and USU related to climate change themes," said the Rector.

USU PR – Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Sc., received an audience from the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) Region 1 Medan. The honorary visit took place in the Bureau's Audience Room on Monday, (4/4/2022).

The Rector of USU said that the BMKG and USU discussed the preparation for the webinar, which will carry themes around climate change.

"This is to prepare for the webinar between BMKG and USU related to climate change themes," said the Rector.

On the occasion, the Rector of USU also mentioned several important points that were also discussed at the meeting, including; about the internship program at BMKG, research collaboration between USU and BMKG, as well as innovations that can be used to assist tasks at BMKG.

"In addition, we also discussed the internship program at BMKG, research collaborations and innovations that BMKG can use to help with daily tasks at BMKG," he explained.

In commemoration of the 72nd World Meteorological Day, the BMKG will hold an online seminar and choose USU as the venue for this activity. BMKG considers that USU is the most appropriate choice to represent the academic community throughout North Sumatra because this webinar will discuss research and science. This is in accordance with what was explained by Darmawan, S.Si., M.Sc. as the head of the Regional I BMKG hall.

"This year we commemorate the 72nd World Meteorology Day, that's why we held a webinar and because it's about research and science, so what we think can represent the academic community in North Sumatra is USU, so we came here to ask the Rector to can fill the event because the event was attended by the governor and the head of BMKG, “said Darmawan.

As BMKG and USU are two institutions that work in science, Darmawan hopes that by holding this activity, both parties will be able to work together to advance USU students and the community.

"It turned out that after we had a meeting with the Rector, we found a lot of things and there are lots of better collaboration opportunities because BMKG and USU are both scientific institutions, so we can improve this with USU, and we have discussed other things. What is urgent is related to the progress of the community at USU and also students at USU," said the Head of the BMKG Regional I Hall.

For information, the USU Rector also conveyed a message to commemorate the World Meteorological Day, as well as thanks to the North Sumatra BMKG for implementing the MoU and several opportunities for collaboration with USU. In addition, the Rector hopes that the North Sumatra BMKG can continue to strengthen this collaboration for the sake of the nation and provide solutions related to climate change that is happening in the world.
