In his remarks, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that USU has a significant role in this memorandum of understanding. USU's role is related to health education, specifically medicine, which studies diseases that often occur in tropical communities.

Public Relations USU—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) collaborated with the Medan City Government, the Association of Indonesian Tours and Travel Agencies (ASITA), the Association of Indonesian Hospitals (PERSI), and the Association of Indonesian Hotels and Restaurants (PHRI) in the Medan Medical Tourism Program on Thursday (02/06/2022). The memorandum of understanding was signed at the Heritage City Hall Hotel Medan.

In his remarks, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that USU has a significant role in this memorandum of understanding. USU's role is related to health education, specifically medicine, which studies diseases that often occur in tropical communities.

"The results of this research are expected to help other health industries or the people of North Sumatra in dealing with the diseases they suffer from," he said.

He said that the USU Hospital will improve the quality of its services and facilities to achieve international standards so that the people of North Sumatra no longer need to seek treatment abroad.

"Let us work together to make the Medan Medical Tourism program a success with strong determination," he said.

Medan Mayor Bobby Afif Nasution, S.E., M.M., said this program will create economic movement in health, tourism, and education.

"Associations that are members of this program need deliberation to resolve problems or obstacles and require the roles of these associations so that the program can be implemented properly," he said.

He also hopes that USU will not only participate in research but can also be implemented in other fields to advance the world of health.

"Hopefully with this program, the development of Medan city will be even better in the future," said the Mayor of Medan.

On the same occasion, the Chairman of PERSI, Dr. Syaiful M Sitompul, said that seven hospitals are collaborating, one of which is the USU Hospital (RS USU). He hopes that each hospital has appropriate community standards and promotional facilities so that the public is aware of this program.

"I am happy because Medan Medical Tourism has been processed," he said.

ASITA Chairman Salahuddin Nasution, S.E., MSP, said the program could also develop tourism in Medan City like in developed countries. This program will encourage people to visit North Sumatra because there are already hospitals with international standards.

"Therefore, there are no more overseas medical travel packages that only have package trips to Medan City or other cities in Indonesia. I appreciate this program because Medan tourism will develop," he said.
