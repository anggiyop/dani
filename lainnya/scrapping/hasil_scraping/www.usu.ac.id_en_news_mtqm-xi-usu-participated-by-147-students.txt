“This is part of the coaching process that we do measurably and run, organized by Ditmawa and LPTQ together,” said Prof. Edy.

 

Public Relations USU - The Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the 11th Student Quran Tilawatil Musabaqah (MTQM) as a selection and coaching event towards the National Student MTQ which will be held at Lambung Mangkurat University, Banjarmasin, this year. The activity took place on (29/04/2025) at the FISIP USU Hall.

 

USU Vice Rector I, Prof. Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH, MA stated that this biennial event results from a tiered coaching process that has been carried out since the pandemic.

 

“This is part of the coaching process that we do measurably and run, organized by Ditmawa and LPTQ together,” said Prof. Edy.

 

Furthermore, USU targets a higher achievement than its brilliant achievement two years ago, when it ranked 4th nationally at Universitas Brawijaya.

 

“We hope we can repeat or even better than what we achieved 2 years ago,” he added.

 

In line with that, Ditmawa Director Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi, M.Psi, emphasized that the winners of MTQM 2025 will be combined with the previous year's champions to undergo rigorous selection. The coaching process not only focuses on training but also conducts further selection to ensure the strength of the USU contingent.

 

“So, in coaching it is not only fostering, but we select at the same time to see where our strength is,” Rahma explained.

 

This year, MTQM USU competed in 9 branches attended by 147 students from various faculties, with the Faculty of Cultural Sciences contributing the most participants, as many as 68 people. The implementation of the 11th MTQM is expected not only as a competition event but also as a medium for building the character of Qur'anic students.
