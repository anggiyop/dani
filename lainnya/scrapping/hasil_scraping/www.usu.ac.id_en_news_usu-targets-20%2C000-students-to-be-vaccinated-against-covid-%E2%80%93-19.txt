The USU Rector said the Covid-19 vaccination process carried out was a preparation for the university to conduct face-to-face lectures.

PR USU- Universitas Sumatera Utara is targeting 20,000 students to be vaccinated against Covid-19. This was conveyed by the Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., while reviewing the implementation of vaccinations at the Pancasila Building, Medan, Monday (9/27/2021).

The Rector said the Covid-19 vaccination process carried out was a preparation for the university to conduct face-to-face lectures which were planned to be held in the first semester of next year.

“We have prepared all local needs which are facilitated by cameras to make hybrid lectures, as well as personnel, and in each locale in the faculty there is a place for washing hands, and PTM lectures and everything is in place, only vaccines for all students," he said.

Mury added that face-to-face meetings will be held if the vaccination has reached 70 percent. So far, around 30 percent of USU students have been vaccinated.

For this reason, the Rector added that in order to fulfill the vaccination of all students, USU continues to collaborate with various parties. "This morning we together with the Salim Group carried out vaccinations, and we continue to collaborate in implementing this vaccine in order to achieve heard immunity," he said.

The Governor of North Sumatra, Edy Rahmayadi, who reviewed USU's vaccine activities, expressed his appreciation to the Universitas Sumatera Utara for carrying out the vaccination. He hoped that all students in North Sumatra were vaccinated against Covid-19.

“I hope not only at USU but in North Sumatra. At USU to generate interest so that other universities will soon be facilitated to carry out vaccinations," he said.

The Covid-19 vaccination for USU students will be held from September 27 to October 7, 2021. (©ULC)
