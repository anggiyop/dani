About Ad-Dakwah USU Student Activity Unit

The Ad-Dakwah USU Student Activity Unit is an Islamic student activity unit that has been established since 1995. This student activity unit started with several Muslim students at USU who were concerned about the development of religious life on the USU campus. As a da'wah-based organization, the Ad-Dakwah USU Student Activity Unit actively conducts regular religious gatherings and organizes religious studies by inviting intellectual, religious scholars. Based on the departments and institutions within this UKM, such as Cadre Development, Contemporary Studies, Da’wah Communication, Finance and Business, Muslimah Studies, Da’wah Training Centre, and Journalism Institution, the Ad-Dakwah USU Student Activity Unit expects its members to operate the organization based on Islamic principles. Joining this student activity unit is seen as a means of accumulating rewards and becoming a medium of communication with Allah SWT.
