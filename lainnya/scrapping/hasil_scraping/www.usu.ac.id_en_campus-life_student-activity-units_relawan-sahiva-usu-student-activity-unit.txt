About Relawan Sahiva USU Student Activity Unit

Relawan Sahiva USU has been established since at least the early 2000s and has served as a platform for student consultation on the Adolescent Reproductive Health Triad, which includes reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, and drug-related aspects. Focusing on volunteerism and community service, it carries out various programs to assist and improve the quality of life in the surrounding community. These programs include providing information and counseling to fellow students on reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, and drug-related issues, as well as raising public awareness about the importance of maintaining health and preventing drug abuse. The Relawan Sahiva USU Student Activity Unit participates in various social activities, such as teaching, health education, aid distribution, and community development. Through collaboration with nonprofit organizations and social institutions, this student activity unit serves as a backbone in the contributions made by Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) towards social awareness and a positive impact on the local community. Joining this student activity unit provides a great opportunity for students to develop social skills, empathy, and leadership abilities.
