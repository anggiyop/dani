Buchari, ST., M.Kes explained that the purpose of this activity was to create new entrepreneurs and technopreuners who carried the concept of 'from lab to market', namely to produce knowledge-based entrepreneurs to support USU Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

USU PR - A total of 63 business plan proposals for Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) students passed the business plan competition held by the USU Student Entrepreneurship Center which was held at the Community Service/Services Institute, Tuesday (11/30/2021). This business plan competition is an activity held annually by the SEC.

"This workshop was attended by 262 participants and succeeded in producing 63 business plan proposals, then, these 63 proposals were reviewed by three reviewers consisting of workshop speakers and USU lecturers who understand entrepreneurship," said USU SEC Chair Buchari, ST., M. case.

Buchari, ST., M.Kes explained that the purpose of this activity was to create new entrepreneurs and technopreuners who carried the concept of 'from lab to market', namely to produce knowledge-based entrepreneurs to support USU's Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

"Today's activity is the last series of the USU Entrepreneurial Student program which was started with a business plan workshop on November 11," he said.

He said, after going through the review process, there were 12 groups of proposals that made it through to the final round, namely the business plan competition. The jury in this competition consisted of practitioners in the MSME sector and USU lecturers.

“The jury will assess the process of the incoming proposals; the proposals that pass will be financed by USU. The jury will determine how much should be given to each business model," continued Buchari.

Buchari said that the participants who pass will be fostered by the SEC in the form of coaching, mentoring and training. They will do business practice in the Entrepreneur Lab. The SEC will also set up a training center.

"We will also include them in the Entrepreneurship PKM program or Karsa Cipta, they will participate in the 2022 KMI Expo, the Indonesian Student Entrepreneurial Activities program, and the Mandiri Young Entrepreneur program held by Bank Mandiri," he said.

Through this activity, Buchari hopes that USU's entrepreneurial embryos will revive. “We will produce entrepreneurial students who excel in many entrepreneurial competitions. This is also part of the Key Performance Indicators, which is to increase the number of students who are entrepreneurship and product innovations,” he hoped. (©ULC)
