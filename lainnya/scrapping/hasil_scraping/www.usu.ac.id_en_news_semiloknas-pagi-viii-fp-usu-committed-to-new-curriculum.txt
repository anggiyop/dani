"A well-designed curriculum will not only enhance the competence of graduates but also contribute positively to the development of a sustainable agricultural sector," added Prof. Hadiwiyono.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted the 8th National Seminar and Workshop of the Indonesian Agrotechnology/Agroecotechnology Association (PAGI VIII) in collaboration with "The 8th International Conference on Agriculture, Environment, and Food Security (ICAEFS) 2024," which was previously organized by USU's Faculty of Agriculture. The event took place at the Digital Learning Centre Building, USU, on Friday, July 26, 2024.

 

This year’s SEMILOKNAS PAGI focused on the theme “Quality Assurance System of Study Programs Towards Global Competitiveness: Relevance of Agrotechnology/Agroecotechnology Curriculum.” Ninety participants from 29 universities across Indonesia attended the event.

 

The Rector of USU, Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in his speech delivered by the Dean of FP USU, Prof. Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana, M.S., emphasized that higher education plays a crucial role in producing young generations who are competent, innovative, and ready to compete globally. Therefore, quality assurance of study programs is critical to ensure that the implemented curriculum is relevant and capable of addressing contemporary challenges.

 

"I appreciate and warmly welcome the organization of this workshop, as USU is committed to supporting the recommendations produced in this workshop," said Prof. Muryanto.

 

Regarding Agrotechnology and Agroecotechnology, curriculum relevance should cover various aspects, from the latest technology in agriculture and environmental sustainability to innovations in agrotechnical practices. The Dean of FP USU hopes this workshop can formulate effective strategies to improve the quality of study programs, thereby producing graduates who excel nationally and globally.

 

"A well-designed curriculum will not only enhance the competence of graduates but also contribute positively to the development of a sustainable agricultural sector," added Prof. Hadiwiyono.

 

Prof. Dr. Ir. Hadiwiyono, M.Si., who serves as the Secretary-General of PAGI and the Chief Architect of the Accreditation Instruments for the Independent Accreditation Institute for Agricultural Higher Education (LAM PTIP), explained that PAGI acts as a communication bridge between policymakers and program implementers in study programs.

 

"Yesterday's and today's activities are mandates from PAGI’s Articles of Association and Bylaws. This is an annual agenda, and this time, we are holding a workshop focusing on themes related to study program management," explained Prof. Hadiwiyono.

 

Dr. Ir. Sandra Pakasi, M.Si., as the General Chair of PAGI, added that Agrotechnology Study Programs are challenged to shift from the old curriculum to a new one that includes the latest technologies in agronomy and agriculture. Technologies like IoT and drones will be integrated into land preparation, plant protection, and fertilization.

 

"A few days ago, we held a curriculum FGD in Solo, and last year in Yogyakarta, we were challenged to change the curriculum. In Medan, we are truly moving forward," stated Dr. Sandra.

 

Dr. Nini Rahmawati, S.P., M.Si., as the Head of the Agrotechnology Study Program at FP USU, Secretary of PAGI, and Chair of the SEMILOKNAS PAGI VIII committee, hopes that this event will support various accreditation improvement programs for all study programs in Indonesia, both LAM PTIP accreditation, which will begin next year, and international accreditation.

 

"The agrotechnology study program curriculum is expected to accommodate stakeholder needs and prepare students to compete globally," said Dr. Nini.
