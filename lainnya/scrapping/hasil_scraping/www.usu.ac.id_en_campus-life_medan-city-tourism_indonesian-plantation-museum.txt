Indonesian Plantation Museum

The Indonesian Plantation Museum stands proudly on Jalan Brigjen Katamso No. 53, Medan City, North Sumatra. This place is not just an empty building but a center of knowledge and insight into the glittering world of plantations in Indonesia. Welcoming visitors with two story-filled floors, the museum displays a barrage of information about plantations of the past, complete with a valuable collection of garden products and historical stories. Each room contains engaging lessons about the journey and development of plantations in Indonesia, not to mention the plantation research centers that contributed to agricultural innovation. Once inside, visitors are invited to explore the knowledge of Indonesia's leading plantation commodities that have captivated the world since the golden age of the 18th century until today. It is impressive how plantations have become inseparable from the nation's history. Not only the contents inside the room but in the front yard, an eye-catching Piper Pawnee airplane is visible. This airplane is a silent witness to history, manufactured in 1958 by PTPN II and tasked with spraying tobacco pests for almost half a century. A valuable opportunity to explore the glorious history of Indonesian plantations and delve into its natural treasures. There is no need to go to Java to recognize the greatness of Indonesian plantations. Just visit the Indonesian Plantation Museum in Medan and immerse yourself in the glitter of the nation's agricultural heritage.
