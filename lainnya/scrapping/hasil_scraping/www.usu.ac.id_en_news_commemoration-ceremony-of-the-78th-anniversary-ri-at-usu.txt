The message is for the entire academic community, to educate students as young Indonesians must be more adaptive to the learning process of digitizing independent learning," said Prof. Muryanto

USU PR-Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a ceremony to commemorate the 78th Anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Indonesia, at the USU Digital Learning Center Building, on Wednesday (17/08/2022). The ceremony took place solemnly with USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si as the master of ceremonies.

On this occasion, the USU Chancellor read a speech script from the Minister of Education, Culture, Research and Technology (Kemendikbud Ristek) Nadiem Anwar Makarim. The text contains the struggle for independence which has been continued to this day through Merdeka Belajar for the past four years.

For the higher education level, their programs, Merdeka Campus Learning, have also succeeded in changing the lives of more than 760,000 students who have the opportunity to study outside the campus, both in industry in schools, and in the community.

The USU Chancellor advised on the learning process to the entire USU academic community, so that students as young Indonesians are educated to be adaptive and open to digital transformation. Because it greatly supports the learning process of independent learning.

"The message is for the entire academic community, to educate students as young Indonesians to be more adaptive to the digitalization learning process of independent learning," said Prof. Muryanto.

In a series of independence ceremonies, the USU Chancellor gave awards in the form of badges to civil servants who had an attitude of loyalty to the state. Therefore, the state appreciates the dedication of civil servants, who have not made any mistakes within 10 years or 20 years.

The USU Rector also said that the interesting thing this year is the increasing achievements of Indonesia. This improvement can be seen in the education sector which is realized in the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program. The program provides experience for the younger generation to contribute to the nation and state.

"This year it is interesting that Indonesia's achievements from last year continue to increase and for education, it continues to increase in the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program," said Prof. Muryanto.
