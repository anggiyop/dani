About Panahan USU Student Activity Unit

The Panahan USU Student Activity Unit was established in 2016. As the name suggests, this student activity unit serves as a platform for students with an interest and talent in archery. This student activity unit is intended to provide training for students to enhance their potential in archery. Students can refer to this student activity unit's official social media account to obtain more detailed information about registration and activity agenda. Additionally, in the Islamic faith, archery is a sport the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) recommended. Therefore, for all students interested in archery, it is highly recommended to join this organization as apart from improving fitness, archery also helps train focus and the mind, thereby enhancing students' abilities in their learning activities.
