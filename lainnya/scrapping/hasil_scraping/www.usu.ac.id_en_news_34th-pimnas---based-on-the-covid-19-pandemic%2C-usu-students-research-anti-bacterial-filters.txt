“Seeing that masks are really needed, so we made a mask filter using nanofiber, we saw the method of making it from a journal review, it turns out that it can be done in the laboratory. The filter that we made is as an antibacterial,” said Sylvia, Participant of USU 34th PIMNAS.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara students researched the manufacture of antibacterial filters on masks by utilizing banana midrib waste, the work of the Exact Research Student Creativity Program (PKM) entitled "Effectiveness of Cellulose Acetate Nanofibers from Banana Sheath Waste (Musa Paradisiaca L.) as an Antibacterial Filter on Masks" it was presented at the 34th PIMNAS event on Wednesday (10/27/2021).

Team members from the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MIPA) S-1 (Undergraduate program) of Chemistry, namely Sylvia Romalia Simanungkalit, Putri Amelia Sihotang, Shofi Tasa Al-Khairi and Dzul Hadi Sahputra and Brian Christopher from the Faculty of Dentistry and their research was also exhibited in the form of a poster in the PIMNAS series. Team Leader Sylvia Romalia Simanungkalit when interviewed on Friday (10/29/2021) said that this work was made based on the COVID-19 pandemic situation where masks are a major need for the community. Moreover, many masks are circulating that do not meet the standards of the World Health Organization (WHO).

“Seeing that masks are really needed, so we made a mask filter using nanofiber, we saw the method of making it from a journal review, it turns out that it can be done in the laboratory. The filter that we made is as an antibacterial,” Sylvia expalined.

The nanofiber filter used has the advantage of increasing the effectiveness of the mask filter because its size is smaller than the size of bacteria. Nanofiber filters bacteria that go through. Her team chose banana stems as a source of nanofibers because they contain anti-bacterial compounds in the form of flavonoids, alkaloids, phenols and saponias. The cellulose content is also quite large, which is about 63%. In addition, banana stems are also very easy to obtain, especially the Barangan banana which is an endemic plant in North Sumatra.

"Products produced from several studies still rarely use banana stems, so we provide an innovation that banana stems can be used in the manufacture of these nanofibers," said Sylvia.

They have done screening, "contact angle" test and product application. It is hoped that this mask filter product can be down-streamed and benefit the community.

According to Sylvia, the PIMNAS jury, during the presentation, said this product should be tested further and they were advised to use an airflow testing device. She and her team thank USU for helping and facilitating the preparation of the 34th PIMNAS. USU has provided monitoring and evaluation as well as guidance by presenting experienced lecturers.

“We are well-prepared; we are given guidance on making posters to presentations. USU has done a lot for this. We hope to bring medals and make USU proud," she said. (©ULC)
