It's not easy to have two functions at once, education and public service with a business aspect. PTN-BH campuses should no longer have a dependence on the government. We have many service units to provide additional sources. RSGM is one of them. The university will always support that," said Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si.

USU PR - The Dental and Oral Hospital (RSGM) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) celebrated its 22nd Anniversary with the theme "Towards the New Look of RSGM USU" Maximum Smile Optimal Service with RSGM USU. The event occurred at the RSGM USU Building on Thursday (Jun. 27, 2024).

RSGM USU is a specialized hospital whose history began as a Dental Clinic, then a Dental Treatment Center, and finally became RSGM USU in 2002. At this anniversary celebration, RSGM USU launched an executive dental specialist service.

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., in his speech, conveyed congratulations and stated that age shows expected progress and contribution. Building a hospital that functions as an educational institution and public service with a business aspect is not easy, and it is important to add sources of income, especially for PTN-BH campuses. Therefore, the rector emphasized that the university will always support RSGM USU.

"It's not easy to have two functions at once, education and public service with a business aspect. PTN-BH campuses should no longer be dependent on the government. We have many service units to provide additional sources. RSGM is one of them. The university will always support that," said Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si.

On the same occasion, the Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry (FKG) USU, Dr. drg. Essie Octiara Sp.KGA., Subsp.PKOA(K) stated that RSGM USU is a very important partner as it is the main educational vehicle for students. She also said she would support the opening of the specialist clinic.

"As the most important partner where we entrust our students, the main educational vehicle for our students, we hope that RSGM USU will continue to develop. And at this momentum, we strongly support the opening of the specialist clinic," said Dr. drg. Essie Octiara Sp.KGA., Subsp.PKOA(K)

The Acting Head of the North Sumatra Provincial Health Office, represented by Dr. M. Emirsyah, MKM, also expressed in his speech the lack of specialized hospitals in dentistry and oral health in North Sumatra. This becomes an opportunity and challenge for RSGM USU to realize quality and easily accessible services. He hopes that the presence of RSGM USU can be increasingly felt by all people of North Sumatra.

"To support the referral health service system in North Sumatra province, there are only two specialized hospitals in the field of oral health. This becomes an opportunity and challenge for RSGM to realize quality and easily accessible services. I hope that the presence of RSGM USU in its 22nd year can be increasingly felt by all people of North Sumatra," he said.

The Director of RSGM USU, Drg. Siti Salmiah Sp.KGA.Subsp.KKA(K) explained that this year's theme reflects the hope that RSGM USU will improve services to the community and serve as an educational platform. She conveyed that RSGM USU, which has been known only as a place for student practice, can provide the best service to improve dental health for the community as a whole.

"RSGM is required to upgrade and advance further in serving the community and supporting academics. RSGM USU has only been known as a hospital for dental students to practice. But it's not like that. So please come to RSGM. We will serve and make the community's teeth even better," explained drg. Siti Salmiah Sp.KGA.Subsp.KKA(K).
