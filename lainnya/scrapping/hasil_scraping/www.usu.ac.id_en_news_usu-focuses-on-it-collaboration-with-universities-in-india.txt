"The qualifications required for IT personnel are more in India than in Indonesia," said Rector.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatra Utara (USU), facilitated by the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia (KBRI), will collaborate with several universities in India. This was conveyed by the Rector of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, in the Preliminary meeting for Higher Education Institutions Indonesia - India, Monday (24/01/2022).

The Rector of USU said that the IT sector is one of the areas that will focus on the collaboration that will be designed because IT progress in India is quite significant.

"The qualifications required for IT personnel are more in India than in Indonesia," he said.

The Rector added that the collaboration will be formulated in student exchanges, lecturer exchanges, and joint research or publications. After this, discussions will be held regarding the memorandum of understanding and agreement format.

"The three themes are quite important. We will carry out detailed technical discussions," he said.

According to the chancellor, in line with the Merdeka Campus program, students from various study programs interested in IT will be allowed to join this program.

"For that, specifications will be made. We will determine what the material base or subject is like," he continued.

Dr. Muryanto also said that this year USU has a target of cooperation to achieve international recognition. For this reason, USU is networked with various universities of 500 QS WUR ranking or even those in the 100 ranks. "We are in that context; our commitment is to get to the 500 QS WUR ranking," he hoped.
