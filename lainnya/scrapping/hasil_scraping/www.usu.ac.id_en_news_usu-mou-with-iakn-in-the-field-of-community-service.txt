"There are a number of things that must be carefully planned in order to carry out community service together, such as the provision of cash, service locations, etc.," stated the USU Rector.

USU Public Relations - Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Institute of State Christian Religion (IAKN) Tarutung. This collaboration was agreed upon on Wednesday, December 21, 2022, in the Rector's Audience Room of the USU Central Administration Bureau Building.

The USU Rector stated that the collaboration between USU and IAKN Tarutung is a partnership between two universities to enhance the reputations of both institutions. In addition, the cooperation can take the form of community service that has an effect or direct effect on the community.

"There are a number of things that must be properly arranged in order to perform community service together, such as giving cash, service locations, etc.," stated the USU Rector.

Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita ST., MT, Director of Internationalization and Global Partnerships, stated at the same time that the collaboration involved the signature of an MOU by multiple USU faculties, research institutions, and community service organizations.
