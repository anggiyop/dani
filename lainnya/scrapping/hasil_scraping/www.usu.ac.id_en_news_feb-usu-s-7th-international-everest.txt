The conference itself invited speakers from several institutions, such as Bank Indonesia, as well as researchers related to economic policy.

HUMAS USU - The Faculty of Economics and Business of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) once again held the 7th Event of Young Researcher and Economic Students (Everest) titled ASEAN Youth Collaboration in Facing The Global Economics Downturn. The event was held at the North Sumatra Governor's Office on Tuesday (23/05/2023).

Associations of economics students attend the conference to discuss economic developments both nationally and internationally. This meeting also encourages students to develop their ideas.

On this occasion, the USU Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations Secretary, Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi, M.Psi, was also present. She mentioned that this conference presented several prominent speakers from various institutions.

“The conference itself invited speakers from several institutions, such as Bank Indonesia, as well as researchers related to economic policy.” said the secretary of Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations.

The Secretary also responded positively to this program because students can provide feedback related to economic policies.

“Students can learn to provide and convey their thoughts and ideas related to our economy,” she explained.

This 7th Everest is different in its focus from the previous years as it includes an international level this year. This was conveyed by the Head of the USU Development Economics Study Program, Dr. Raina Linda Sari, S.E., M.Si.

“Our first step is to work at the ASEAN level. So then we know that at the ASEAN level, Indonesia participates in the success of programs in the economic field. Students are challenged to participate in conveying their ideas and thoughts,” said Dr. Raina.

Finally, it is hoped that this event will encourage students to be more confident in developing their ideas in the field of economics, not only at the national level but also on an international scale.
