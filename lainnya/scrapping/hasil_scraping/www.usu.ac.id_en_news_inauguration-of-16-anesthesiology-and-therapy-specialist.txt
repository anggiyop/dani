On Sunday (22/01/2023), the Faculty of Medicine (FK) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) inaugurated 16 Anesthesiology Specialists. The inauguration was celebrated by the awarding of the USU Faculty of Medicine Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy Expertise Mark and the USU Faculty of Medicine Critical Care Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy Fellowship Mark at the Grand Mercure Hotel.

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt, Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation of USU, stated that this must be properly appreciated because it is proof that a doctor's professionalism and talent in a field is officially recognized.

"The awarding of the mark of expertise is an official acknowledgment of the professionalism and skill acquired as a doctor in a specialty," WR III USU stated in his speech.

With the inauguration of 16 Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy Specialists, WR III USU expects they will be dedicated and dependable in their duties. Furthermore, the Specialists must be committed and consistent in their service to the community, particularly at Prof. Dr. Chairuddin P Lubis USU Hospital.

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt, also greeted the new PPDS Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy at the inauguration event.

"We sincerely hope that new specialty doctors will significantly contribute and commit to helping patients, particularly at USU Hospital. We sincerely hope that the new PPDS will be able to complete their studies on time, "He stated.

The inauguration of 16 Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy Specialists brings the total number of graduates from the FK USU Anesthesiology & Intensive Therapy Specialist Study Program to 165 since its inception in 2001.

The chairperson of the Anesthesiology & Intensive Therapy Specialist Study Program FK USU, dr. Andriamuri P.Lubis, Mked (An), SpAn.KIC aims to meet the needs of anesthesia services well, particularly in the North Sumatra region, with the increased number of anesthesiology and intensive therapy specialists.

"So, this Anesthesia Study Program has been in operation since 2001 and has graduated 165 students. Today, we provide 16 people with a certificate of knowledge and ten people with an orientation to the new PPDS. Hopefully, more of our graduates will be on time and satisfy the needs of anesthetic services in the future, particularly in the North Sumatra region, "said the Program Director of Anesthesia and Intensive Therapy Specialists.

For example, the Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy Specialist Study Program will be reaccredited in 2023 to retain exceptional accreditation and expand worldwide cooperation.
