"On behalf of the USU Rector, I would like to thank the Faculty of Medicine for conducting accreditation several times with satisfactory results," said Prof. Fidel.

USU PR - The Assessment Team from the Association of Indonesian Higher Health Education Independent Accreditation Institutions (LAM-PTKes) conducted an Accreditation Visitation for Masters of Clinical Medicine Study Program, Faculty of Medicine (FK) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) on March 24-26.

During his visit on Thursday (3/24/2022), USU Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked (OG), Sp.OG(K) expressed his appreciation to FK which has carried out accreditation several times with very satisfying results.

"On behalf of the Rector of USU, I would like to thank the Faculty of Medicine (FK) for conducting accreditation several times with satisfactory results," he said.

For information, in 2022 there will be 14 study programs in FK that will be reaccredited, one of which is the Master of Clinical Medicine. Prof. Fidel hopes that more and more study programs at FK can be accredited with excellence, so that in the future it will achieve international accreditation so that it can encourage the achievement of IKU 8.

"It is hoped that the S1 program will have many international accreditations so that there will be more IKU 8 achievements and USU will have a higher ranking," he explained.

Prof. Fidel also advised the FK academic community to continue to improve performance. “I hope we will do better, because FK is the oldest faculty at USU. So we have to maintain the existence of FK," he said.

Dean of FK USU, Prof..Dr.dr. Aldy Syafruddin Rambe, Sp.S(K), said that FK will continue to improve to be better by involving various stakeholders and alumni.

"We will involve support from various parties, such as support from the USU Teaching Hospital and the H. Adam Malik Central General Hospital in Medan," he said.

FK is currently focusing on excellence accreditation. Currently, two study programs in FK have been accredited with excellence, 17 have been accredited A, four have been accredited B and one new study program is still in the process of LAM PTKes accreditation.

"We hope that FK accreditation in the future can be better than what we have achieved before," he concluded. (©ULC)
