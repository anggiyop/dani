Showing his love for the Malays was the reason Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH., MA writes about Communal Land and Legal Pluralism.

USU Public Relations - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Library held a book review event by the Vice Rector I for Academic Affairs for Student Affairs, and USU Alumni Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., entitled Conflict of Communal Land and Legal Pluralism. The activity took place in The Gade Creative Lounge Room, USU Library Tuesday, (8/17/2022).

Showing his love for the Malays was the reason Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH., MA writes about Communal Land and Legal Pluralism.

He was inspired after doing archival studies in the Netherlands. In his study, WR I found a lot of historical data that can be re-discussed related to the Malay land.

"Actually, it was inspired when doing archival studies in the Netherlands," he said.

WR I said the article he wrote was aimed at disseminating information related to the conditions experienced by the Malays.

"The first is to disseminate the information contained in the book so that more people are enlightened regarding the conditions experienced by the Malays," Edy Ikhsan said.

According to WR I, book review is an interesting academic activity. This activity is not only carried out by lecturers but also to students. This can happen as long as there are publications that can be socialized, analyzed, and reviewed by the members of the Academic Community.

"This is an interesting activity and book review is a very important academic activity which is not only carried out by lecturers but also students," Edy Ikhsan mentioned.

As additional information, the book dissection by Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA conducted by Dr. Suprayitno, M. Hum and Prof. Dr. OK. Saidin, SH., M. Hum. (©ULC)
