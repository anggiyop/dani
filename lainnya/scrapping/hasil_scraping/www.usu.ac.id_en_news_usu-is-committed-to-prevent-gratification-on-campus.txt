"We will understand what is called gratification, how it is implemented, its prohibition and how to control this gratification," said VR II USU.

USU Public Relations - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Gratification Control and Complaint Handling Unit Team held a Socialization event for Rector Regulation (Pertor) Number 24 of 2021 concerning Gratification Control at USU. The socialization was held in the USU Academic Senate Room and broadcast through a zoom meeting on Thursday (12/23/2021).

USU Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP, said this activity was important to follow up on many things, related to Bureaucratic Reform, Corruption-Free Regional Integrity Zones, and Clean Serving Bureaucratic Areas. .

"We will understand what is called gratification, how it is implemented, its prohibition and how to control this gratification," he said.

The socialization was delivered by the Head of USU's Office of Legal Affairs Prof. Dr. Tan Kamelo S.H., M.S. He said that the Pertor contained guidelines for employees within USU in preventing gratification.

"The Pertor  regulates how to control gratuities at USU from the university level, work units, faculties, to study programs," he said.

According to him, this Pertor is part of preventing the practice of Corruption, Collusion and Nepotism (KKN) starting from the university environment, so that USU can become good university governance.

"The academic community will be able to avoid the practice of gratification, especially in the implementation of education in universities, campuses are the pioneers in combating this behavior," he continued.

The Head of the USU Internal Audit Unit, Dr. Narumondang Bulan Siregar, MM, Ak, CA, QGIA also said that this socialization event was a tangible form of USU's commitment to improving the quality of institutional governance.
