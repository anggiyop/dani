USU's FEB Dean, Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si interprets that ZI WBK is a form of selfless, excellent service that is given to stakeholders. The stakeholders referred to in this program are students, parents of students, the community, and internal parties.

PR USU – The Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is activating the Corruption Free Area Integration Zone (ZI-WBK). This WBK ZI socialization activity took place at FEB on Tuesday, (31/05/2022).

USU's FEB Dean, Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si interprets that ZI WBK is a form of selfless, excellent service that is given to stakeholders. The stakeholders referred to in this program are students, parents of students, the community, and internal parties.

“I as the Dean of FEB interpret that ZI WBK is a form of selfless excellent service to stakeholders. Who are the stakeholders, students, parents of students, the community, and internal parties, "said the Dean of FEB.

Vice-Dean II of FEB Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE, M.Si explained that this program was a mandate given by the Rector, particularly to the reformation bureaucracy directorate. In addition, this declaration started by declaring that FEB was ready to support the WBK ZI program with the hope of making the culture at FEB better bureaucratically.

"We started today with the declaration by reading out our declaration. We are ready to support the ZI-WBK program, and we hope to make the culture at FEB better, both technical and lecturer, making the best of everything bureaucratic and not breaking the rules," said the Doli.

On the same occasion, the Director of the Directorate of Bureaucratic Reform and Transformation, Dr. Nurman Achmad, S.Sos., M.Soc.Sc said FEB is ready to commit to implementing ZI WBK. He added that other faculties also showed readiness for ZI WBK.

"Alhamdulillah, today FEB has officially stated that it is ready and committed to implementing ZI WBK. We need to know that if they have ZI, the ZI leadership is committed to implementing a corruption-free area, so I hope other faculties show that we are ready, and we are ready to do that," he said.

There are several programs in the declaration of ZI WBK, namely innovation to avoid service fraud, to hospitality management which is one of the reasons FEB is enthusiastic about running ZI WBK.

“There are several follow-up programs from this program. First of all, there is service innovation to avoid service fraud. Then the most important thing is this hospitality management which makes us at FEB very enthusiastic to carry out ZI WBK so that the culture change in serving, especially the stakeholders, is for the better, "said Dr. Nurman.
