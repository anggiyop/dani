As a result, we congratulate the ALDERA book's publishing on this occasion. " Hopefully, Dr. Pius Lustrilanang will publish instructive works that encourage young people to contribute to the development of this nation constructively, "said USU's Rector

USU PR: Hundreds of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) students filled the USU Student Center for Aldera's public talk and book critique. The program was organized by Kompas Book Publishers, the ALDERA Foundation, and USU on Friday (03/03/2023).

The ALDERA book, written directly by historical actors of the moment, provides a historical image of the political movement of young people struggling for democracy from 1993 to 1999. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, Rector of USU, expects this to inspire young people to protect the country's constitution and progress. The Rector also expressed his enthusiasm at the publishing of this book.

"As a result, we congratulate the ALDERA book's publishing on this occasion. " Hopefully, Dr. Pius Lustrilanang will publish instructive works that encourage young people to contribute to the development of this nation constructively, "said USU's Rector.

Dr. Pius Lutrilanang, S.IP, M.Si, SA, CFRA, Member VI of the Supreme Audit Agency of the Republic of Indonesia, was the keynote speaker at this event and one of the main characters in the ALDERA book. He claims that USU students are very excited about this activity and well-versed in the evolution of social and political concerns. He hopes that through reading the ALDERA book, students would be infected with the principles of the struggle, particularly the need to safeguard democracy and the reforms that have been fought for.

"I believe they are still aware of today's social and political realities, as well as what their forefathers did in the past who battled tooth and nail to preserve democracy. I hope the principles of this struggle are passed on to them, "Dr. Pius stated.

Speakers for this activity included Dean of the Faculty of Law (FH) USU Dr. Mahmul Siregar S.H., M.Hum and Dean of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences USU Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., M.Sp.

According to the Dean of the Faculty of Law, this book explains in detail how the young movement evolved into the People's Democracy Alliance (ALDERA). He went on to say that the ALDERA Movement was one of the pivotal events in overthrowing the New Order dictatorship.

"This movement is essential because it finally led to what we see as the ruler; the regime can be destroyed," stated USU's Dean of the Faculty of Law

According to the Dean, referring to the ALDERA book, students today face distinct challenges than students from the 1990s generation. According to him, the battle of students has become more complex due to technological advancements, globalization, and a highly competitive globe.

"It has become more complex due to technological advancements, globalization, hypercompetitiveness, and other factors. As a result, young people must improve their movement to meet the needs of the 20th century," he said.

Following the public lecture and book review, the activity continued with the planting of the BPK RI-USU democracy tree in the yard of the USU Student Center by the USU Rector and Member VI of the Supreme Audit Agency of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr. Pius Lutrilanang, S.IP, M.Si, SA, CFRA.
