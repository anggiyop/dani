"We need to become human beings who are resilient to the situations as we are in a country that often faces disasters," he said.

USU PR - Deli Art Community together with the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Cultural Discussion with the theme "Disaster Management" as an effort to improve community preparedness in dealing with disaster.

The activity was held in the USU FISIP Meeting Room on Friday (1/28/2022), presenting speakers with various perspectives, namely USU FISIP Lecturer Drs. Yance, M.Si., and Lecturer of FISIP UMA Dr. Ressi Dwiana, M.A.

Deli Art Community Chairman Dini Usman, S.Sos., M.M., said that Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is the confluence of three of the world's tectonic plates, making it highly vulnerable to various disasters.

"Indonesia is in the ring of fire, so one disaster is not over, yet another disaster has come," she said.

Responding to this, the community needs to have disaster awareness, good knowledge, mental readiness, and resilience to get on their feet quickly.

"We need to become human beings who are resilient to the situations as we are in a country that often faces disasters," she said.

This matter, Dini added, needs to be explored more deeply through this Cultural Discussion, such as studying the local wisdom of the community concerning disasters.

In addition, it is also important to ensure that decision makers and disaster regulators have sufficient knowledge.

"All parties with an interest in this situation must have the same alertness and perspective, so that we can have mental readiness, the spirit of mutual cooperation, and help each other in every disaster we face," she continued.

According to her, it is not only the community that must increase collective awareness, but the government is also emphasized to be able to further finalize regulations related to disasters.

"Don't just feel safe, we need knowledge and work hand in hand," she emphasized.

For information, the Cultural Discussion is a program of the Deli Art Community which has been going on for almost a year by raising various current themes. (©ULC)
