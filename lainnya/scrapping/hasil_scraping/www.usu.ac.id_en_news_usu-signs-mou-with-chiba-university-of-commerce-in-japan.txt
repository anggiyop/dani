During his visit to CUC, Japan, USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, SSos, MSi, accompanied by Vice Rector for Finance and Human Resources, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, SSos, MSP, explained that the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Chiba University of Commerce in Japan is aimed at facilitating joint research, student and staff exchange, visiting professorships, and guest lecture programs. This collaboration will involve faculty members from Chiba University of Commerce teaching at USU.

HUMAS USU - The University of North Sumatra (USU) has initiated a collaboration with Chiba University of Commerce (CUC), a leading institution in Japan, renowned for its commitment to becoming a 100 percent renewable energy university. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between these two universities serves to bolster the internationalization initiatives of both institutions.

During his visit to CUC, Japan, USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, SSos, MSi, accompanied by Vice Rector for Finance and Human Resources, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, SSos, MSP, emphasized that the MoU signing with Chiba University of Commerce is intended for joint research, student and staff exchange, visiting professorships, and guest lecture programs. This collaboration will facilitate the presence of CUC faculty members at USU, enriching the educational experience.

The chancellor stated, "This partnership is expected to enhance international research collaboration and provide greater global exposure for USU students, enabling them to adapt more effectively to the global environment. To ensure the success of this collaboration, we aim to establish program oversight to maintain a focused and sustainable partnership."

USU's relationship with CUC has been established for several years, with USU students previously participating in exchange programs. These exchanges included three students in 2015, one student in 2017, and two students in 2019. The USU delegation's visit to CUC is anticipated to further expand collaboration, particularly in the realm of joint research.

Prof. Mury also expressed his desire to learn from CUC about their renewable energy university concept and the implementation of an integrated CUC research center. He added, "Through this collaboration, we encourage cooperation in research publication and citation, as well as collaborative research for doctoral programs and other academic initiatives."

Chiba University of Commerce is distinguished for its excellence in economics, accounting, sustainability, and research programs. Prof. Mury expressed his hope that even within the fields of economics and accounting, the PhD programs offered should maintain a connection to information technology (IT).

"USU is also prepared to provide accommodations for CUC lecturers or teaching staff who may be sent to USU. In 2024, USU looks forward to realizing all the planned cooperative endeavors," stated Prof. Mury.

The President of Chiba University, Toshinori Nakayama, warmly welcomed the collaboration with USU. CUC, originally established as an accounting school in 1928, attained university status in 1950. Its primary campus is situated in Ichikawa City, Chiba Prefecture, a mere 30 minutes from Tokyo.

Toshinori Nakayama shared, "The university is part of the Global Partnership of Asian Colleges, which comprises nine universities from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Israel. The overarching goal of this partnership is to encourage student exchanges among partner institutions." According to Toshinori Nakayama, this partnership with USU will broaden the global reach of their university, and they are committed to promptly advancing the terms of the MoU. "We will immediately identify the professors capable of accommodating international students to implement this MoU," he added.

As previously reported, USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin, along with Vice Rector for Finance and Human Resources, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, SSos, MSP, Head of the Priority Program Evaluation Agency, Ikhsan Siregar, ST, MEng, and Director of Internationalization and Global Partnerships, Prof. Dr. Eng Himsar Ambarita, ST, MT, conducted a working visit to Japan to explore opportunities for collaboration in pursuit of USU's internationalization program.
