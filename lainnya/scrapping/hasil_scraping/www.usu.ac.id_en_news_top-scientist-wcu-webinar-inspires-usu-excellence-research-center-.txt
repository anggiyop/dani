USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Webinar World Class University (WCU) Top Scientist with the theme "Exosomes in Pancreatic Cancer: From Early Detection of Therapeutics Delivery". Held online on Friday (12/10/2021), this webinar presented speakers from King College London United Kingdom, Prof. Khuloud T. Al-Jamal.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that the topic is expected to provide inspiration regarding the establishment of a center of scientific excellence at USU. Simultaneously also increase the quantity and quality of medical services, research and publications.

“Prof. Khuloud T. Al-Jamal will share information and experiences, especially for lecturers and students who are studying cancer topics and their treatment and derivatives," said the Rector in his speech.

The Rector hopes that this general lecture will provide experience for students and lecturers in developing many perspectives of competence and skills as well as knowledge. According to him, this can support USU to enter the level of international standardization.

"Not only about WCU's interests, but more importantly increasing knowledge of research themes whose results are beneficial for the academic world and provide solutions to problems in society," said Dr. Muryanto.

To achieve this, USU will collaborate with international lecturers and USU lecturers as well as students to carry out research on certain topics.

"We have prepared facilities for that, in this case especially the Faculty of Pharmacy. We hope that the dean can provide insight to prepare a research scheme that can be assisted by Prof. Khuloud, until the publication of the joint publication of the research conducted," continued Dr. Muryanto.

The Rector of USU advised that scientific research and research is the most important thing in the academic world. Each lecturer is expected to be able to have at least one research and publication in his field or related to competence in other fields of science.

"The general lecture that we conducted today in the context of WCU, apart from giving new ideas, also motivates us to produce a research project funded by universities and grants for scientific research competitions," he concluded. ((C)ULC)
