So USU can cooperate with the village, and the village can benefit from the presence of USU students through cooperation programs, said Vice Rector I.

USU PR- In support of the Thematic Community Service Program (KKNT), the University of North Sumatra (USU) held a Gathering and Implementation Arrangement Document Preparation with Village Partners. The event took place on Tuesday (05/12/23) at the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall, Faculty of Economics and Business.

This meeting was initiated by the University of North Sumatra to bring the campus closer to the villages where USU students carry out KKNT. There are ten regencies/cities involved in the KKNT program, namely Batu Bara, Deli Serdang, Humbang Hasundutan, Karo, Langkat, Medan, Samosir, Serdang Bedagai, Simalungun, and Tanjung Balai.

Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., said that this meeting is expected to produce equal benefits for the university and the village.

"So USU can cooperate with the village, and the village can benefit from the presence of USU students through cooperation programs, said Vice Rector I.

On another occasion, USU Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., in her opening remarks, said that the activity was not only aimed at strengthening the partnership that had been built, but also as a first step in forming the Implementation Arrangement document, through the signing of the KKNT Regular and KKNT MBKM Implementation Cooperation Document in 2023 between the Dean of the Faculty and the Village Head.

"This document will be our basis for regulating the framework and responsibilities of each party so that the program can run smoothly," said Prof. Poppy.

Vice Rector III hopes that students who are currently and will be implementing KKNT can positively impact the community as agents of change.

"So whatever good messages are conveyed will be easily accepted by the community, providing a good example," said Prof. Poppy.

Terkelin Sembering, the Head of Kuta Gugung Village, Sibolangit, representing the other village partners, welcomed the arrival of USU students to their villages through the KKNT program. He expressed pride and appreciation for the presence and changes made by KKNT participants in their villages.

The Head of Kuta Gugung Village said the KKNT program has three pillars: Education, Training, and Community Service. If all three pillars are implemented, the KKNT program can succeed.

"If these three can be implemented, I am sure that KKN will be much awaited in villages in the future," said Terkelin.

Terkelin Sembering hopes that this activity can be sustainable so that it can be continued for KKNT participants in the following years.
