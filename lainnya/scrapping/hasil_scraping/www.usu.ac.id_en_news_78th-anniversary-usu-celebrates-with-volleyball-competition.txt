A match can be likened to "vegetables with no salt" If one were to assert that "victory is not everything” in a game, victory is indeed everything. If there's no winning, there's no necessity to play. But of course, there are rules to obey, and that's universal.

USU PR-Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the Competition Opening at the USU Volleyball Field to enliven the 78th Indonesian Independence Day (HUT). This competition was held on Tuesday (08/08/2023).

This opening event will begin with a volleyball competition, which will also be the first race. This activity will hold nine matches: volleyball, karaoke, sack race, tug of war, terompah, fashion show, balloon dancing, aqua race, and cheerful sarong. The entire academic community participated in the various competitions held.

Prof. Dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked (OG), Sp. OG (K)-Fer, Secretary of the University, said that this competition must prioritize sportsmanship and family spirit in implementing the competition.

Furthermore, Prof. Fidel admitted that he prefers team competitions because victory is achieved together, not just for one person. Teamwork is expected in this case.

"Victory is achieved together. So one great person, for the whole volleyball team there are 6, one great person is a national team player. But the other 5 players in this neighborhood are not. The national team player is meaningless because his other friends cannot support his strength. This means that cooperation to form a team is very, very expected for a team sport. And that is the philosophy that is expected," he said.

Prof. Fidel added that the competition was a form of friendship between the academic community to build the University jointly.

"In addition to enlivening the Republic of Indonesia's Independence Day, it is also for friendship between USU's staff," he stated
