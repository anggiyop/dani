"The students will be accompanied to complete the files needed for the Proposal Submission process on the MBKM website," said Dr. Esther.

USU PR - The Education Development and Service Unit (UPP) and the Office of International Affairs (KUI) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an activity to discuss the follow-up to the registration of the Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) to the Merdeka Learning Portal, Merdeka Campus. The activity was held online on Wednesday (3/23/2022).

Previously, the list of participants who passed the IISMA selection for Internal USU 2022 was announced, there were 96 USU students from 11 faculties who passed the file selection.

"The students will be accompanied to complete the files required for the Proposal Submission process on the MBKM website," said the Head of the USU Office of International Affairs, Dr. Esther Nababan, M.Sc.

In 2021, there were 2,551 students from 172 universities who applied to the center. Meanwhile, 1000 students from 98 universities have successfully graduated, including 5 students from USU. Dr. Esther Nababan, M.Sc hopes that more USU students will graduate from the IISMA 2022 program so that they can study at 300 of the world's top universities.

"In this program, it is hoped that students will also have a network in the international arena," he said.

Esther said that some of the problems that occurred in the 2021 IISMA registration should not happen again, such as in the selection of courses, problems with parental consent, and student chronic illnesses that were not communicated with the Central IISMA Pokja team.

"We are more serious, we hope that miscommunication or misunderstanding will not happen again," he continued.

In line with this, the Head of USU UPP Prof. Dr. Dwi Suryanto, M. Sc, expects support from various parties so that USU students who register can pass to take part in IISMA 2022.

"I also hope that parents give permission, support, and prayers so that our children can pass and run smoothly in all their activities," said the USU UPP Chair.

According to him, through this activity USU will get more positive impacts to provide broader insight in facing global competition.

"IISMA or what is commonly referred to as the student exchange program, regarding an independent campus, provides opportunities for students to be able to study outside USU in order to have a broader perspective in the future," he said. (©ULC)
