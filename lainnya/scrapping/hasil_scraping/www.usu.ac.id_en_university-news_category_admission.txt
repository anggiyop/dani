USU Welcomes 2,303 new students for the 2023 SNBP Program

The high number of new USU students accepted with the Smart Indonesia Card (KIP) Kuliah this year exceeds the government's target of 20 percent, shows the commitment and concern of Universitas Sumatera Utara to the community in increasing access to education for the less fortunate. This surpasses the minimum limit of government policy for State Universities to accommodate students with KIPK. We hope this policy can help the Government and the community during this difficult economic time.
