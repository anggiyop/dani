“This program shows USU's commitment to becoming a green campus that is not only clean and beautiful but also innovative in environmental management,” explained Prof. Poppy.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a socialization related to System Design and Derivative Product Research and Commercialization Potential from Domestic Waste Management Towards Zero Waste. The event took place at the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB) 8th floor, on Monday (16/12/2024).

 

This socialization aims to create an efficient, modern, and environmentally friendly waste management system, as a step to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the 12th point. Vice Rector III of USU, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt. said that this program is not just about cleanliness, but about shared responsibility in realizing a sustainable lifestyle.

 

“This program shows USU's commitment to becoming a green campus that is not only clean and beautiful but also innovative in environmental management,” she said.

 

Vice Rector III, also reminded the importance of investing in behavior change today for future generations. He hopes this program can be expanded to all faculties and become an inspiration for other universities in Indonesia.

 

“The changes we make today will be a valuable legacy for future generations. Let's together make USU a pioneer of sustainable waste management,” he concluded.

 

The Dean of USU's Faculty of Engineering, Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM, emphasized the Faculty's commitment in supporting the waste management system through advanced technology. The Faculty of Engineering has designed various innovations, such as waste ATMs and the development of electric cars and motorbikes for waste transportation on campus. The waste processing system will produce organic fertilizer and biomass that support the circular economy concept.

 

“We hope that waste will no longer be considered as waste but as an economically valuable resource. With the technology we have developed, waste management will be more efficient and can be adapted outside the campus environment,” said Prof. Fahmi.

 

Zaid Perdana Nasution ST. MT. Ph.D., Lecturer in Environmental Engineering, highlighted the important role of students in supporting the success of this program. With the number of USU students reaching 35,000, he believes that they can be the main motor of change in the campus environment.

 

“Student awareness is the key to success. If all elements of the campus move together, we are optimistic that this program can become a national pilot,” said Zaid.

 

Zaid also added that the program involves not only the Faculty of Engineering but also other faculties, such as Psychology, Medicine, and FISIP, in its early stages of implementation. He hopes that cross-faculty synergy can support the smooth running of this program in the future.

 

“Collaboration between faculties will expand the scope of the program and accelerate the realization of the vision of a sustainable campus at USU,” he added.
