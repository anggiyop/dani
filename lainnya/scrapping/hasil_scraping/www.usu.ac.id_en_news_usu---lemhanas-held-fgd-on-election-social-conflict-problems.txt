The Rector said that there were many problems with the issues discussed, especially those related to the electoral conflict in Indonesia. Therefore, recommendations and solutions are needed to overcome this.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si in collaboration with the National Defense Institute (Lemhanas) in carrying out Focus Group Discussion (FGD) activities. The activity was carried out in a hybrid manner in the Senate Room of the USU Central Administration Building on Tuesday, (15/06/2022).

In an activity that discussed social conflicts in general elections (elections) and their prevention for the success of the 2024 elections, the Rector said that he was pleased because Lemhanas trusted USU to be one of the places for discussion.

The Rector said that there were many problems with the issues discussed, especially those related to the electoral conflict in Indonesia. Therefore, recommendations and solutions are needed to overcome this.

The Rector also mentioned several points in overcoming this, including independence of identity, establishing election law enforcement, political education, political reform, potential conflicts, and regulations for improving elections.

The Rector hopes that by holding a study on elections, academics can study and create programs that can later be applied in social life.

Deputy for Strategic Studies of the National Defense Institute of the Republic of Indonesia (RI) Prof. Dr. Ir. Reni Mayerni, MP said that Lemhanas coming to North Sumatra was to find facts and data on the ground because North Sumatra managed to handle the 2019 elections well.

And make North Sumatra one of the studies of handling elections because it has various ethnic groups, communities, and beliefs.

"Lemhanas itself is a non-ministerial institution used by the president to make policies for the next election," he said.
