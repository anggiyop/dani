Disability Services

Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is committed to creating an inclusive and friendly education environment for all academicians, including students with special needs. Currently, USU does not have an independent Disability Services Office. However, academic services for disabled students have been provided through Integrated Service Unit (ULT). As part of its continuous development efforts, USU is developing a Disability Services Unit that aims to provide more comprehensive support to academicians with disabilities. This service will include the provision of accessible facilities and infrastructure, inclusive curriculum development, as well as specialized consultation and assistance services to support the academic and social success of students with disabilities. With this strategic step, USU is fully committed to realizing an equal and inclusive campus, where every student has the same opportunity to develop and achieve their best potential.
