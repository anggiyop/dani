"Indonesia’s independence was the result of our collective struggle. Likewise, in our efforts to advance education and culture, we must continue to work together in the spirit of gotong royong," the Rector asserted.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted a flag ceremony to commemorate the 79th Anniversary of Indonesia’s Independence. The solemn event took place at the USU Central Administration Building courtyard on Saturday, July 17, 2024, and was attended by the entire academic community.

In his address, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., reminded everyone that Indonesia's independence was achieved through collective struggle and the spirit ofgotong royong (mutual cooperation). He emphasized that the same spirit should be upheld in the pursuit of advancing education and culture.

"Indonesia’s independence was the result of our collective struggle. Likewise, in our efforts to advance education and culture, we must continue to work together in the spirit of gotong royong," the Rector asserted.

The Rector highlighted that over the past five years, USU has been actively involved in theMerdeka Belajar (Freedom to Learn) movement, a transformative effort aimed at changing the educational system and mindset. This significant transformation has presented various challenges, but the results are now being felt. Students can now explore their interests and potentials through theKurikulum Merdeka (Freedom Curriculum), which was introduced as the national curriculum this year. Additionally, millions of university graduates have gained better employment opportunities thanks to their experiences in theKampus Merdeka (Freedom Campus) program.

Furthermore, the Rector noted that the implementation of the Kurikulum Merdeka and Kampus Merdeka programs has had a positive impact on students and graduates. He expressed hope that USU will continue to produce competent and innovative graduates who can contribute to national development.

During the same occasion, USU also unveiled a new logo for its 72nd Dies Natalis (Anniversary). The logo symbolizes USU's commitment to creating a conducive learning ecosystem, improving the quality of academic services, and promoting research outcomes that can be widely utilized by society. Through various initiatives, USU aims to contribute to enhancing the quality of Indonesia's human resources and accelerating national development.

"We strive to produce graduates who are ready to face the challenges of the workforce and can provide solutions to the problems faced by society," said the Rector.

The Rector added that USU is working to produce graduates who are prepared to meet daily challenges and contribute to increasing competitiveness and innovation. He expressed hope that through these efforts, USU can help boost Indonesia's per capita income and achieve the vision of a Golden Indonesia by 2045.
