“Because this cooperation will further improve the quality between regencies or regions in North Sumatra,” said the Dean of FISIP USU.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si and Dean of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) USU Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., MSP became speakers at the Regional Cooperation Coordination Meeting in the Context of Optimizing and Mapping Government Affairs and Efforts to Increase Competitiveness Through Domestic and Foreign Cooperation. The activity took place at Le Polonia Hotel Medan, North Sumatra, on Thursday (27/10/2022).

Dean of FISIP USU Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., MSP, said that the form of cooperation that occurs is an integrated development area, namely by using capital for cooperation and increasing the initiation of each region or district to improve public services for the community.

“Because this cooperation will further improve the quality between regencies or regions in North Sumatra,” said the Dean of FISIP USU.

The Dean of FISIP USU also hopes that North Sumatra has a higher index, which is obtained from various aspects such as government, business entities, universities, communities, and the media. These aspects can help to promote the work of North Sumatra.

“This cooperation can also be one way to improve the name of North Sumatra,” he said.

Head of the Government and Regional Autonomy Bureau of the Regional Secretariat of North Sumatra Province Ir. Zubaidi, M.Si said that this activity was held for cooperation with regions or districts in North Sumatra.

“So that all employees in the districts and regions understand about cooperation and how to coordinate,” he concluded.

Ir. Zubaidi, M.Si, also said that this was done to equalize the perception of cooperation between the provincial government and regencies, cities, and companies to know how to cooperate and how to coordinate in order to coordinate and manage efficient cooperation.

“I think it is necessary to equalize the perception between the provincial government and the regency so that there are no more confusing things that are wrong,” he said.
