Asy-Syifa Mosque

The Asy-Syifa Mosque is located within the premises of the USU Faculty of Pharmacy (FF USU), specifically on Jl. Tri Dharma, Gate 4 of USU. The Asy-Syifa Mosque has recently undergone renovation to provide comfort for the USU academic community and the surrounding community who wish to worship. In addition to daily prayers, the Asy-Syifa Mosque also regularly holds Friday prayers every week.
