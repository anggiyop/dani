University Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), SpOG(K), said this webinar is one of USU's efforts to increase the capacity and competence of its human resources, as well as optimize all available potential.

USU PR - Improving service quality and performance at the Universitas Sumatera Utara, especially in the scope of protocol activities, USU held a Webinar 'Guidelines for Protocol Standards in Higher Education'. This webinar was held through a zoom meeting on Thursday, (11/18/2021).

University Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), SpOG(K), said this webinar is one of USU's efforts to increase the capacity and competence of its human resources, as well as optimize all available potential.

"So far, there are still some weaknesses as a result of the lack of complete and comprehensive information related to guidelines for implementing protocol activities that are suitable for various conditions in the field," Prof. Fidel said.

Prof. Fidel hopes that all participants, especially the public relations of the faculties, can improve their knowledge and abilities in organizing protocol activities, both in their respective work environments, as well as participating in the implementation of larger protocol activities at the university and government levels.

"I hope that the faculty and university public relations staff can carry out their protocol roles, functions and responsibilities better than before," he said.

Through this activity, he hopes that USU can continue to improve its reputation in the future and realize USU as a university with international standards.

This webinar presented two speakers, namely Protocol Practitioner from the Presidential Secretariat/USU Alumni 2004 Samson Leider Nadeak, S.Sos, M.Pub.Pol and Protocol from Gadjah Mada University Jack Haryanto, SE, MM. (©ULC)
