USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si officially opened the University of Nicosia (UNIC)-USU Moodle Opening Socialization event, entitled “Exercise and Nutrition Management in Cancer Patients”.

This socialization followed up on the Erasmus + program collaboration, namely Sport and Physical Education as A Vehicle for Inclusion and Recognition in India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka (SPIRIT).

Opening his remarks, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si conveyed a positive impression that motivated USU to develop further cooperation with UNIC, especially in projects that apply the Life Long Learning Courses model teaching method. In this cooperation, UNIC is recognized as having a more open development, and USU has learned a lot from UNIC's experience.

“We are very impressed because the lecturers from UNIC and other partners also play a role in providing enthusiasm and positive contributions to the development of the project,” said Prof. Muryanto.

The program highlights that a healthy mind and a healthy body are essential for the well-being of society. This commitment must be built from a young age, especially in academics and students. For this reason, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si hopes that this collaboration can be an enriching experience and bring many benefits from every form of cooperation.

“USU plays an active role in the development of this project with other partners, such as India and Sri Lanka. With the support of guidance from the University of Nicosia higher education institution,” said Prof. Muryanto.

Kyriakos Georgiou as Senior Administrator in the Office of the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs UNIC explained that this program has a main focus on health, nutrition, cancer, and healthy lifestyles that are very important for everyone. So that it provides broad benefits, not only for academics and students, but also for everyone who can benefit from the learning experience through the program.“Of all the universities in this project, I must admit that USU is a very proactive university, and responded with positive feedback. So we are very happy,” Kyriakos said.

Kyriakos Georgiou explained that the course is a lifelong learning program where all participants from the university are enrolled as students for eight specific courses. The lifelong learning course is also designed for diverse learning materials. This creates opportunities for participants to develop their knowledge and skills in various relevant areas.

“So I strongly encourage you, if you have the time and desire, to take other courses as well. It will be very beneficial for you and your colleagues, as well as fellow students,” Kyriakos said.
