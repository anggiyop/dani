"The collaboration that will be formed is the development of facilities within USU, one of which is the dormitory concept to make it easier for students to get dormitory facilities," explained the Rector of USU.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) designed a collaboration with PT. Waskita Realty to improve facilities and infrastructure at USU. The discussion on the cooperation design was held at the Rector USU Office House, Friday (10/12/2021).

Rector USU Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. said that improving campus facilities and infrastructure is one of the efforts to improve university rankings.

"The collaboration that will be formed is the development of facilities within USU, one of which is the dormitory concept to make it easier for students to get dormitory facilities," explained the USU Chancellor.

In addition, the development of other facilities will also be designed, such as the USU Dental and Oral Hospital.

"We will design developments that can improve the quality of education and institutional facilities, one of which is the Dental and Oral Hospital," said the Rector.

Dr. Muryanto Amin said the pattern and the financing scheme will be analyzed.

“The rate will be determined flexibly based on the market. We arrange it that way," he continued.

He said the next step was the signing of the MoU and designing the realization of this cooperation project.

President Director of PT Waskita Realty Eri Prananto said that his party as a property SOE is trying to be able to reach all educational institutions, one of which is USU.

"We will see the potential that the PPP program can develop where the university provides land, we BUMN as investors will enter the point where USU needs development," said Eri Prananto.

He hopes that USU as one of the largest universities in Indonesia can become a strategic partner for PT. Waskita Realty.
