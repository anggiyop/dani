“This workshop is also expected to provide suggestions on what should be done by all of us to accelerate the steps towards (gaining) ranking at 500+ or 1000+ World Class University,” said the Rector of USU.

HUMAS USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) invited the Regional Director of Southeast Asia & Japan, Mr E Way Chong, as a guest speaker at the QS World University Ranking (QS WUR) Workshop. The event, which was attended by Private and Public Universities from North Sumatra, Riau, and Aceh, took place at the Prof Suhadji Hadibroto Hall of Faculty of Economics and Business USU, Tuesday (10/01/2023).

It is known that USU is promoting a program to become an internationally reputable university. Therefore, the workshop entitled “QS Ranking 2024 Methodology and Updates” will help universities to design strategies and increase efforts towards achieving targets in the QS WUR assessment.

USU Rector, Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, said that this forum is expected to open opportunities for USU and other universities to discuss the methodology and achieving assessment indicators so that it provides progress for universities participating in the workshop, especially for USU itself.

“This workshop is also expected to provide suggestions on what should be done by all of us to accelerate the steps towards (gaining) ranking at 500+ or 1000+ World Class University,” said the Rector of USU.

One of the reasons why USU and other universities in Indonesia are preparing for internationalisation is the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology policy. Director of the Department of Internationalisation and Global Partnerships, Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita ST., MT. explained that QS ranking is one of the indicators in achieving this.

“So we brought in two speakers to explain what the international ranking methodology is. We invited several universities in North Sumatra and also other provinces to learn about the QS ranking technicalities and methodologies. That's the reason for this activity,” said Prof Himsar.

Prof. Dr Eng. Himsar Ambarita ST., MT. added, there are six indicators in the QS WUR assessment, including academic reputation, alumni reputation, ratio between lecturers and students, ratio of lecturer’s journal citations, number of international students, and number of foreign lecturers.

In addition, through the workshop (which is a form of contribution from USU), he hopes that USU and other participating universities will all be ranked at the world level.

“Hopefully, by inviting our guest speakers, we can encourage our fellow universities here to achieve world-class rankings. That's the hope,” he concluded.
