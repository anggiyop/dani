Orangutans, a symbol of biodiversity, live in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo. Prof. Agus Purwoko explained the uniqueness of the three orangutan species as well as ecotourism strategies that support conservation and improve the welfare of local residents.

Amidst the lush tropical rainforests spanning Sumatra and Borneo, a creature exudes immense charm- the orangutan. With their powerful long arms and distinctive red fur glistening in the sunlight, they are not only icons of natural beauty but also symbols of biodiversity that must be preserved. Their graceful movements amongst the trees, intelligence, and adorable facial expressions will mesmerize anyone who sees them.

Forestry expert Prof. Agus Purwoko from the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Indonesia, said that orangutans are divided into three unique species: Bornean orangutans, Sumatran orangutans, and Tapanuli orangutans. Each species has distinctive characteristics that add to its diversity and uniqueness. Bornean orangutans are known for their larger bodies and broader faces, while Sumatran orangutans have slimmer bodies and more oval faces. The Tapanuli orangutan, the latest discovery in primatology, has very distinct features and is only found in the Tapanuli region of North Sumatra.

“Orangutans are not only vital to the rainforest ecosystem but also captivate the hearts of humans who see them. They play an important role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem by dispersing the seeds they eat, which in turn helps to regenerate the forest. In addition, orangutans take center stage in ecotourism because of their physical and behavioral charms. Tourists from all over the world come to Sumatra Island to see first-hand the wildlife of orangutans, witnessing how they play, interact, and lovingly care for their young,” said Prof. Agus Purwoko.

The uniqueness of orangutan behavior, such as using tools to obtain food and building nests in trees every night, adds to their appeal. Every orangutan encounter offers a profound and inspiring experience, reminding us of our interconnectedness with nature and the importance of maintaining biodiversity. This prompted Prof. Agus Purwoko to conduct further observations on the lives of orangutans. The team consisted of Wanda Kuswanda, Rospita Odorlina Pilianna Situmorang, Muhammad Hadi Saputra, and Parlin Hotmartua Putra Pasaribu (National Research and Innovation Agency-BRIN) and Freddy Jontara Hutapea (University of Melbourne).

They argue that Sumatra Island is a prime destination for those who want to feel close to nature and learn more about conservation efforts. Since 1973, orangutan conservation centers have been developed on Sumatra Island, with Bukit Lawang Conservation Station as the pioneer. Built to rehabilitate orangutans abandoned or kept illegally, Bukit Lawang has become a symbol of hope for orangutan conservation.

“However, the journey of this conservation center has not been easy. The 1997 monetary crisis, devastating flash floods in 2003, and the COVID-19 pandemic were some of the major challenges the center had to face. Despite this, Bukit Lawang has survived and strives to continue contributing to orangutan conservation,” said Prof. Agus Purwoko.

The potential for orangutan ecotourism in Sumatra is huge. These conservation centers have strong ecological support, adequate facilities, and a wealth of local wisdom. The presence of charismatic orangutans and their stories of struggle can add significant value to ecotourism development. Imagine a tour that not only offers beautiful scenery but also an immersive experience of conservation and wildlife, where tourists can learn and participate directly in conservation efforts.

Prof. Agus Purwoko explained that orangutan ecotourism development requires a comprehensive and well-planned strategy. The first step is to map the location and distribution of wild orangutans. This is important to ensure that tourism activities do not disturb their natural habitat. In addition, the management of orangutans in conservation centers must be done carefully to maintain their welfare.

The next step is to provide attractive and educational tour packages. These packages can include in-depth trips to the forest, educational sessions on conservation, and interactions with local communities. Tourists can take expert-led tours, witness orangutan rehabilitation, and even participate in release programs. Empowerment of the surrounding community is also very important. Communities must be involved in managing this ecotourism through the Community-Based Ecotourism Management (CBEM) approach. This model is economically beneficial and ensures that local communities feel the benefits of ecotourism.“In addition, it is important to develop a fair benefit-sharing model that anticipates and minimizes the negative impacts of ecotourism on orangutans. Integration of orangutan ecotourism with local wisdom can also be a special attraction for tourists. For example, tourists can learn about local culture and traditions related to nature conservation,” explained Prof. Agus Purwoko.

The Indonesian government has issued various regulations to protect flora and fauna, including orangutans. Law No. 5/1990 on the Conservation of Living Natural Resources and Ecosystems and Law No. 41/1999 on Forestry are among them. These regulations support the development of nature-based tourism and community-based ecotourism. However, field observations conducted by Prof. Agus Purwoko and his team found that implementation on the ground still requires greater effort and support. The active participation of the government and cooperation with non-governmental organizations are crucial to ensure that this regulation runs effectively.

The research conducted by Prof. Agus Purwoko and his team shows that orangutan ecotourism in Sumatra faces various challenges. The 62% decline in visits to Bukit Lawang Conservation Station between 2014 and 2016 shows that issues must be addressed. The COVID-19 pandemic has also negatively impacted this ecotourism. Bukit Lawang Conservation Station is the only center that is synergizing conservation and ecotourism. Other conservation centers, such as Jantho, Batu Mbelin, and Sungai Pengian, have great potential but have yet to be fully implemented.

This suggests an urgent need for innovation and adaptation in ecotourism strategies. For example, developing digital or virtual ecotourism could be one solution to re-attract tourists. In the study, Prof. Agus Purwoko and his team put forward several recommendations as follows:

Mapping the Location and Distribution of Wild Orangutans in their Natural Habitat: Accurate mapping of the location and distribution of wild orangutans is essential. This information helps plan ecotourism activities that do not disturb their habitat and ensure tourists get an authentic experience.
Management of Orangutans in Conservation Centers: Orangutans in conservation centers, both fully captive and semi-captive, are managed to high welfare standards. This includes medical care, proper nutrition, and an environment that mimics their natural habitat to maintain their physical and mental health.
Provision of Tour Packages: Develop attractive and educational tour packages. These packages can include forest tours, direct observation of orangutans in natural habitats or conservation centers, educational sessions on conservation, and participation in orangutan rehabilitation activities.
Community Empowerment: Involve local communities in every aspect of ecotourism. Training and empowering them to become tour guides, homestay managers, or souvenir artisans will provide direct economic benefits and increase their sense of ownership of the conservation program.
Institutional Strengthening of Community-Based Ecotourism Management (CBEM): Strengthen the institutions that manage community-based ecotourism so that they can run the program effectively and sustainably. This includes the establishment and development of working groups, management training, and provision of access to resources and information.
Ecotourism Development Through Benefit Sharing Models: Develop a fair and transparent benefit-sharing model so that all parties, including local communities, conservation centers, and the government, benefit from ecotourism. This will create incentives to conserve orangutans and their habitat.
Anticipate and Minimize Negative Impacts of Ecotourism on Orangutans: Identify and minimize potential negative impacts of ecotourism on orangutans, such as habitat disturbance and disease risk. These measures include regulating the number of tourists, closely monitoring orangutan interactions, and implementing strict health protocols.
Integrating Orangutan Tourism with Local Wisdom: Integrate orangutan tourism with local wisdom to create a unique and authentic tourism experience. This could include participating in traditional ceremonies, learning about the traditional uses of medicinal plants, or learning about myths and folklore relating to orangutans and the surrounding environment.

With these strategies, orangutan ecotourism on Sumatra Island will provide memorable experiences for tourists, support sustainable conservation efforts, and improve the welfare of local communities. They are the beneficiaries and the main drivers in preserving orangutans and their environment. This community-based approach will ensure that ecotourism is not only ecologically sustainable but also socially and economically sustainable. In addition, public education and awareness of the importance of orangutan conservation must be continuously improved.

“The importance of community involvement and sustainable management practices is emphasized to ensure the long-term viability of orangutan conservation and ecotourism programs. With the right strategy, orangutan ecotourism in Sumatra will thrive and become a model for nature-based conservation and tourism efforts worldwide. This is a long journey that requires hard work and commitment. Still, the results will be significant for the future of orangutans and the well-being of our environment,” concluded Prof. Agus Purwoko.
