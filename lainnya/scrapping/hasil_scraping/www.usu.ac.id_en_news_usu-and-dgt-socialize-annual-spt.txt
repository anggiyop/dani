"We hope that with good cooperation between the tax office and USU, we can resolve tax issues, especially those related to the voluntary disclosure program and the submission of individual annual tax returns," said VR II.

USU - PR: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) held a Socialization Program for Voluntary Disclosure and Submission of Annual Individual Tax Returns. This activity was held in a hybrid manner at the FISIP Multipurpose Building and a zoom meeting on Monday (14/03/2022).

In the event, the tax advisory team from the Tax Service Office (KPP) Pratama Medan Polonia, conveyed the socialization of the Voluntary Disclosure and Submission of Individual Annual SPT programs. Meanwhile, the e-filling corner for the Annual Individual Personal Tax Return will be open from March 14 to 18, 2022.

USU's Vice-Rector II, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos, M.SP said that the Universitas Sumatera Utara could cooperate with the tax office to resolve tax issues. Even though they routinely fill out the Annual Individual Tax Return as of March 31, there are still those who have not reported it.

"We hope that with good cooperation between the tax office and USU, we can resolve tax issues, especially those related to the voluntary disclosure program and the submission of individual annual tax returns," said VR II.

Furthermore, VR II said that there were USU Tax Administration D3 students as tax volunteers who would help solve this problem.

"There are students who are usually called tax volunteers from the D3 Tax Administration who will help," he said.

In order to achieve the expected output, VR II hopes that USU can participate in and carry out the voluntary disclosure program activities and submit the annual individual tax return until the end.
