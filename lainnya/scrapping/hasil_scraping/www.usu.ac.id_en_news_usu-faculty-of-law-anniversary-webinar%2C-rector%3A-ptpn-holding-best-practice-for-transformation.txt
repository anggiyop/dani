"We can translate the transformation of increasing PTPN holding as best practice carried out by institutions, how they can adapt to changing times," the USU Rector said.

USU PR - In the context of the 68th anniversary, the Faculty of Law (FH) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Scientific Week webinar entitled "Transformation Strategy to Improve PTPN Holding Performance" in an effort to socialize and increase knowledge understanding.

The webinar was held through a Zoom meeting on Monday (1/17/2022), presenting the Chair of the Doctoral Study Program in Law, USU's Faculty of Law, Prof. Dr. Ningrum Natasya Sirait, SH., M.Li and the President Director of PTPN III - Member of the USU Board of Trustees Dr. Muhammad Abdul Ghani as resource person.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said, this Legal Science Week provides benefits for institutions, communities and institutions related to studies on legal developments in Indonesia. According to him, the topic of PTPN Holding is quite appropriate if it is taken as a best practice step to carry out the transformation.

"We can translate the transformation of increasing PTPN holding as best practice carried out by institutions, how they can adapt to changing times," he said.

Dr. Muryanto added, as a humanities discipline, USU Faculty of Law can adapt the concept of a technosocio-preneurship university by collaborating with the industrial world.

“Socio humanities in FH can contribute to society and be studied as well as be implemented. For example, with PTPN Holding, what activities can be done to provide solutions to the problems being faced," he continued.

He hopes that, after this year's anniversary, USU Faculty of Law can implement a 'transformation towards the ultimate' by increasing research and innovation in a sustainable manner.

"More innovations, publications and applied research that are beneficial to the industrial world," he hoped.

On this occasion, the Dean of USU Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum., also hopes that through this Legal Science Week, an open study can be carried out on how to increase transformation in the performance of BUMN PTPN Holding.

"Thus, we can learn important lessons on how to elaborate the governance of our company or university," he said.

He added, this Law Scientific Week will be held for the next one week with a focus on discussions on law enforcement and various legal topics that are currently up to date.

"The results of the study from the Legal Science Week will be sent to stakeholders, and it is hoped that they can be input," he said.

For information, the celebration of the 68th Anniversary of the Faculty of Law USU was filled with a series of events in the form of a poster competition, social services for counseling and legal consultation, scientific orations by the Minister of Law and Human Rights, blood donors, as well as hospitality for alumni and stakeholders.

Dr. Mahmul said, on January 12, 2022, USU Faculty of Law had been established for 68 years. Now, the alumni of USU's Faculty of Law have filled many important public institutions, including the Supreme Court, DPR RI, Ministries, Police, Attorney General's Office and other institutions. (©ULC)
