"The number of students who took the Indonesian Pharmacist Competency Exam in February 2022 was 84 people and 65 people passed. Then 65 students took the oath," he explained.

The oath-taking participants this time are the 31st batch, since the Department of Pharmacy under the auspices of USU's FMIPA changed to USU's Faculty of Pharmacy in August 2006.

After the Dean of the USU Faculty of Pharmacy apt. Khairunnisa, S.Si., M. Pharm. Ph.D did a hammer tap, all participants were sworn in according to their respective beliefs.

"The pharmacist's oath is a mandatory requirement that must be carried out by every pharmacy alumni who will become pharmacists before they enter pharmacy practice," he said.

The Dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy hopes that in the future students can make their best contribution to the advancement of Indonesian health and continue to update knowledge because science related to health continues to develop.

"My message and hope for new pharmacists or students who are sworn in today can give their best contribution for the advancement of Indonesian health and continue to update knowledge because science related to health continues to develop, so I hope to continue to upgrade science so that it can provide the best contribution to the development of health in Indonesia," said the Dean.
