"The commitment and strong desire to jointly carry out activities is part of the university's planning towards excellence in global competition and part of the journey towards a World Class University (WCU)," Prof. Poppy explained.

USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) became one of the initiators in the National University Network in Indonesia (NUNI).

There were 21 universities that joined as NUNI Declarators and expressed their readiness to carry out the programs that had been planned during the NUNI Working Meeting on August 3-4,2011.

"The commitment and strong desire to jointly carry out activities is part of the university's planning for excellence in global competition and part of the journey towards a World Class University (WCU)," said USU Deputy Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, M.Sc., Apt., who attended the NUNI meeting in Jakarta, Monday (11/21/2022) evening.

Prof. Poppy explained, by joining this consortium, it was hoped that USU would find it easier to improve the internationalization program. By collaborating, several universities in Indonesia help each other in actualizing their WCU programs.

She explained that USU was part of the founders of NUNI and had been initiated since the era of USU Rector Prof. Syahril Pasaribu. "Yesterday was the signing of the deed of establishment," she said.

The event itself was also part of an international seminar entitled Enchahing Graduate Employability in ASEAN through Internationalization of Higher Education which was held on Tuesday, November 22, 2022.

The 21 NUNI declarators consisted of Unand, Atama Jaya Yogyakarta University, Binus, UB, Undip, Unhas, UII, Sultan Agung Islamic University, Atma Jaya Indonesian Catholic University, Soegijapranata Catholic University, Maranatha Christian University, Petra Christian University, Satya Wacana Christian University, UMM , Unpad, Parahyangan University, Sanata Dharma University, Eleven March University, USU, University of Surabaya and Udayana University.
