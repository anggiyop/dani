This is the first inauguration of Indomaret at USU. Now we pray that this event can have many positive impacts," said the USU Rector.

USU PR- Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si led the inauguration or grand opening of Indomaret USU accompanied by Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP, Vice-Rector for Asset and Business Management Ir. Luhut Sihombing, MP and Branch Manager of PT Indomarco Prismatama Medan Branch Yonanta Kusuma at the Indomaret USU Store Page, University Street on Tuesday (27/6/2023).

In his remarks, the USU Rector thanked PT Indomarco Prismatama for working with USU to form a collaboration to provide positive benefits, especially for lecturers, the academic community, and students.

Student enthusiasm looks relatively high with the opening of Indomaret outlets in the USU environment because students can find the items they need quickly.

"This is the first Indomaret inauguration at USU. Now we pray that this event can have many positive impacts," said the USU Rector.

Branch Manager of PT Indomarco Prismatama Medan Branch Yonanta Kusuma explained that the grand opening of the Indomaret outlet at USU is the 325th outlet of the franchise store. The purpose of Indomaret in the USU environment is to provide convenience shopping services for students, teaching staff, and the community around the USU campus.

"Alhamdulillah, in the future, we hope that with Indomaret on campus, Universitas Sumatera Utara can provide easy shopping services for students, perhaps for every teacher and the community around the University of North Sumatra campus," he said.

The goods traded are also tailored to things that support student activities. For additional information, consumers who shop above Rp50,000 will be rewarded with coupons that will be drawn to get attractive prizes.

"For the preparation, we are quite smooth. We have also prepared several things. Including here, we also provide several prizes for consumers who shop above Rp50,000," he added.
