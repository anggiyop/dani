“Universities are centers of innovation, so that academics are expected to attend from campuses that solve problems of the times. Indonesian universities must continue to improve their academic reputation towards the best," said the Rector who is also the Deputy of FRI.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is committed to opening a space for synergy and collaboration with various parties. Recently, USU agreed to an MoU with the Islamic University of Malang (Unisma) Malang. The signing of the MoU is carried out to increase synergy and collaboration to achieve the goals of each party.

The signing of the MoU itself was carried out in a series of National Seminar events held by the Indonesian Rector Forum (FRI) on Tuesday (1/11/2021) at the Unisma Roundabout. The East Java Governor, Dra. Khofifah Indar Parawansa, M.Si., officially opened the event which was attended by the Rectors from universities throughout Indonesia.

Khofifah said that synergy and collaboration are very important in achieving goals. This should always be the spirit of universities and the government. This collaboration will increase the potential for the success of the efforts made.

“The synergy of higher education institutions with the government is continuously needed to improve the welfare of the community. So far, this synergy has been going very well and has spawned many innovations from academia. So far, the contribution of public and private campuses is quite large, for the life of the nation and state," she said.

On that occasion, Khofifah hoped that the national seminar held by FRI would give birth to many new thoughts and innovations. According to him, it is time for universities to continue to make a positive contribution to improving the government system and improving the welfare of the Indonesian people.

Unisma Rector Prof. Dr. H. Maskuri, M.Si., said the collaboration built through FRI added enthusiasm to go further. The National Seminar activity initiated by Unisma and FRI is a form of movement for change.

“Universities are centers of innovation, so that academics are expected to attend from campuses that solve the problems of the times. Indonesian universities must continue to improve their academic reputation towards the best," said the Rector who is also the Deputy of FRI.

During the event, FRI provided assistance to survivors of the eruption of Mount Semeru Lumajang. The assistance provided is in the form of actual funds of 300 million rupiah. It was handed over directly by the Chair of FRI Prof. Dr. Ir. Panut Mulyono, MEng, DEng (GMU Rector) through the Governor of East Java. (©ULC)
