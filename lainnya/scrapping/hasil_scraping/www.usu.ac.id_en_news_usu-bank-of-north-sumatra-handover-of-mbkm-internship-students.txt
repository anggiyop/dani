MEDAN – USU PUBLIC RELATIONS: The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Bank of North Sumatra handed over the student interns participating in the Merdeka Learning-Independence Campus (MBKM) program. There were 11 students from various faculties who participated. The event was held at the Bank Sumut Ballroom, 10th Floor, on Wednesday (22/9/2021).

On this occasion, USU's Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA representing the USU Rector, handed over the internship student which was accepted by Subhan Pardosi, Human Resources Division of Bank Sumut. Edy said this program follows the direction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Kemendikbudristek).

“This MBKM is a national policy initiated by the Ministry of Education and Culture to be implemented by all universities in Indonesia. USU as one of the universities is committed to the success of the program by sending our students to this Bank of North Sumatra to become participants," said USU's Vice Rector I.

Edy explained that the 11 participants consisted of six people from the Faculty of Economics and Business, one person from the Faculty of Engineering, one person from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Engineering, two people from the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, and one person from the Faculty of Law. The 11 students became the first batch of apprentices at Bank Sumut.

Subhan Pohan, who accepted the interns, appreciated the collaboration with USU. He hopes that students can follow the syllabus that has been prepared by his party.

“There have been various collaborations that have been carried out by the Bank of North Sumatra, and we hope that this collaboration will be successful and successful as well. We also hope that students can follow the syllabus that we have prepared for this internship process,” said Subhan.

He conveyed that the presence of the apprentice students became the main capital for Bank Sumut itself in conducting corporate socialization. Subhan stated that Bank Sumut’s target is to become the market leader in banking services in North Sumatra. To achieve this, Bank Sumut needs fresh ideas and creativity from the younger generation.

Edy agreed with this opinion by motivating students to make good use of this opportunity. According to him, not everyone gets experience for internships at Bank Sumut.

“Make the most of this golden opportunity. Show your qualities. Bank Sumut will see the potential in you, and if you are lucky, Bank Sumut can recruit younger students to become their employees after participating in this internship,” Edy said.

The activity was also attended by USU Expert Staff and education staff, Bank Sumut employees, and invitees. The handover was carried out symbolically by exchanging souvenirs. Before leaving, the entire audience took a group photo. (RR/©ULC)
