"5S is a philosophy and a way for an organization to organize and manage the workplace into a comfortable place to work, so that productivity increases and is efficient," explained Prof. Bustami.

USU PR - The Technical Implementation Unit for the Integrated Research Laboratory, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held 5S Training and Implementation (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, Shitsuke) as an effort to regulate workspaces and workflows in order to create efficiency in the UPT Integrated Lab environment. The training activity was held at USU UPT Integrated Lab, Tuesday (12/21/2021).

5S Instructor Prof. Dr. Ir. Bustami Syam, M.S.ME explained, 5S is an abbreviation of 5 words in Japanese, namely Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, Shitsuke. In Indonesian, the 5Rs can be translated as 5Rs, namely Concise, Neat, Clean, Careful and Diligent.

"5S is a philosophy and a way for an organization to organize and manage the workplace into a comfortable place to work, so that productivity increases and is efficient," he explained.

He added, the application of 5R can save space and time by sorting the items needed and making labels on each item or place.

“Our workplace, which was a mess, we have to sort out what is needed so that it looks clean. Make a label where it is so that we can easily see and access it,” continued Prof. Bustami.

According to him, the most difficult thing to implement is Shitsuke, which is how a job becomes sustainable. There is a need for standardization to arrange the flow and schedule, so that each activity can be carried out according to the target.

“We have to make continuous improvement, we set our targets gradually. In order for it to be successful, a team must be formed to take responsibility for it,” he said.

For the Integrated Lab UPT, Prof. Bustami hopes that all existing facilities can be used optimally and well maintained. The Integrated Lab UPT can be an example for the implementation of 5S in all USU environmental work units.

“Yesterday at the Integrated Lab UPT there were already K3 and KAN 17025, actually there was a meeting point with 5S. We are looking for staff and expertise so that they can make the best use of them, we have to make all kinds of changes," said Prof. Bustami.

According to him, the success of 5S needs to be supported by funding and organizational commitments, as well as commitment from the leadership. (©ULC)
