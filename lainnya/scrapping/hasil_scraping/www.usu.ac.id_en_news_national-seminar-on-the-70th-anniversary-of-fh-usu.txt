USU PR - The Faculty of Law (FH) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a national seminar on the Convergence of General Courts and Administrative Courts (PTUN) in Settling Disputes on Government Wrongful Acts. This seminar is also part of a series of events for the 70th Anniversary of the Faculty of Law of USU, on Tuesday (20/02/2024).

The main discussion in this seminar or scientific week focused on the convergence between state administrative courts and general courts by presenting Prof. Dr. Supandi, S.H., M.Hum, and Prof. Dr. Budiman Ginting, S.H., M.Hum, as speakers. This anniversary was attended by students, lecturers, and the entire FH USU community.

The Dean of FH, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.H., said that one of the goals of the anniversary is to motivate and encourage that FH USU has extraordinary alumni. This seminar taught students about the meeting point between the Administrative Court and the General Court.

“It means there is a meeting at one point between the Administrative Court and the General Court,” he said.

Prof. Dr. Hasim Purba, S.H., M.Hum, the Coordinator of the Seminar, said that the seminar presented speakers from FH USU, both those who have succeeded as practitioners and theorists. Prof. Hasim added that this is a provision to add insight into the field of law.

“In addition to strengthening their knowledge, it also motivates them to be in the world of practice one day. The presence of alumni teaching and alumni giving public lectures is very important,” said Prof. Hasim.

Prof. Dr. Budiman Ginting, S.H., M.Hum., as the speaker, said that students must prepare themselves carefully and wisely on how to develop knowledge. So that the knowledge learned is maximally well understood, especially with the administrative system.

“We hope that with the convergence seminar of the State Administrative Court on unlawful acts of the government, students as agents of change must prepare themselves carefully and be wise and prudent,” he said.
