USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, SSos, MSi said the Go-Abroad Fair was a bridge for universities to expand their network with the international community and this was in line with the internationalization program that had been launched by USU.

USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) expanded its international network by opening an educational exhibition booth in Ultrecht, Netherlands, for two days, Friday-Saturday, (11/25-26/2022).

In the activity entitled Go-Abroad Fair, USU had the opportunity to introduce studies, apprenticeship programs, summer course programs, sabbatical leave, student mobility, and others.

USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, SSos, MSi said the Go-Abroad Fair was a bridge for universities to expand their network with the international community and this was in line with the internationalization program that had been launched by USU.

"The Netherlands itself is a country that is familiar to Indonesia. There is an inherent history of closeness and this is expected to be a special attraction. We hope that after this exhibition, our foreign students, especially those from the Netherlands, can increase," said the Rector who was present in person to the Netherlands with Deputy Rector I Dr Edy Ikhsan, MA, and Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe, SE, MSi.

The Rector emphasized that USU is committed to designing transfer experiences programs for campuses around the world. USU students who come from various countries will be served with international standardized Tri Dharma.

"USU will be a place of inclusive learning for all regardless of background," he stressed.

The Go-Abroad Fair itself is attended by the best universities around the world. In previous years, this exhibition itself has been attended by 80 institutions from 20 different countries with 8,670 visitors. At this exhibition, USU introduced USU's profile, excellent study programs, facilities, tuition and living expenses, tourist sites and culinary delights.
