“This collaboration is in line with USU's vision of expanding international networks, especially in supporting the Merdeka Belajar program. We hope that USU students can experience academic and cultural experiences in Turkey, said Prof. Muryanto.”

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., welcomed the visit of the Turkish Ambassador to Indonesia, H.E. Talip Küçükcan, who was also attended by Dr. H. Rahmat Shah as Hon. Consul General of Turkey. It took place at the USU Rector's Audience Room on Friday (06/09/2024).

The meeting discussed opportunities for educational and cultural cooperation between Indonesia and Turkey, especially in the development of USU students who will continue their studies in Turkey. Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., welcomed this cooperation opportunity and hoped that the programs discussed could be realized soon.

“This collaboration is in line with USU's vision of expanding international networks, especially in supporting the Merdeka Belajar program. We hope that USU students can experience academic and cultural experiences in Turkey,” said Prof. Muryanto.

One of the important points conveyed to this audience was the effort to empower USU students who received scholarships to continue their master's and doctoral studies in Turkey. The Turkish Ambassador stated that the Turkish government strongly supports the development of higher education for Indonesian students by providing various scholarships.

“We have around 4,500 Indonesian students studying in Turkey, with 900 of them getting scholarships every year from the Turkish government,” he said.

In addition, plans for student exchange programs between USU and several universities in Turkey were also discussed. The Turkish Ambassador said that Turkish universities are very open to this cooperation. According to him, student exchanges will not only broaden academic horizons but also enrich cultural understanding between the two countries.

“We want to open more cooperation between universities in Indonesia and Turkey, including USU. Diplomacy is not only about politics but also about science, culture, and education. Universities are the main key in building this bridge,” he added.

In the audience, Dr. H. Rahmat Shah added that this cooperation is not only beneficial for the academic world but also has the potential to open up new opportunities in the industrial field, especially in research and development. One example is the opportunity for cooperation between USU and Turkish companies in the field of chemical production.
