Financial literacy empowers individuals and has a relatively broad and significant impact on one's life," said the USU Rector

USU PR- USU Back Home, a series of events to commemorate the 71st Dies Natalis of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), was held again on Friday (September 29, 2023). Held at the USU Auditorium, the event titled Livin’up Your Financial USU Back Home: Alumni Inspiring brought together four inspiring USU alums to share their stories and progress.

USU Back Home is a special activity carried out by the USU Directorate of Achievement, Student Affairs, and Alumni since the commemoration of USU's 70th Anniversary. This activity is intended to strengthen the relationship between USU and alums in particular.

On this 71st Anniversary, USU Back Home brought 4 USU alumni who have made brilliant progress in their fields, including Director of Compliance and Human Resources of Bank Mandiri Agus Dwi Handaya (Accounting Study Program Alumni 1989), Wealth Business Head Region I Sumatra 1 Bank Mandiri, Malhind Desianty (Management Study Program Alumni 1993), Chief Executive Officer of 99 Group, Wasudewan (Agribusiness Study Program Alumni 2000), and News Anchor TV One, Tysa Novenny (Communication Science Study Program Alumni 2007).

The Financial Literacy theme at the USU Back Home event aligns with the Mandiri Edukasi Program. USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, in his speech, underlined the importance of financial literacy as a critical skill everyone must have.

"Financial literacy empowers individuals and has a fairly broad and significant impact on a person's life," he said.

However, the fact remains that financial literacy is still a challenge in many countries. Many individuals need basic knowledge about budgeting, managing debt, and investing. Therefore, the USU Rector hopes that bringing in alum experts in economics/finance will provide students with understanding and insight into financial management skills.

"Financial literacy is an investment in your future, which can help you achieve financial freedom and stability," he concluded
