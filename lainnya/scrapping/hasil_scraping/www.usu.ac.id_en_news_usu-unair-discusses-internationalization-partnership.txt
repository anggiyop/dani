The next step must also be intense coordination in synergy, looking again at what internationalization achievements still need to be realized. Develop a new program based on input from friends, especially from UNAIR." Vice Rector III stated

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an information-sharing discussion on internationalization cooperation with Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR). This discussion was held in the Senate Room on Friday (11/08/2023).

Internationalization is the goal of all universities in Indonesia. In this case, USU and UNAIR discussed internationalization, the need to improve human resources, facilities and infrastructure, and work achievements.

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, M.Si., Apt. as Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation, said that UNAIR provides an excellent example to USU and has many similarities in the process towards internationalization.

"We already have cooperation with UNAIR. And in terms of what, yes, we have much in common between USU and UNAIR. Hopefully, we will move together towards this internationalization. Not competing internally, but together we move forward for internationalization. USU needs this because it is still too far away; we must follow friends who set a good example, "explained Prof. Poppy.

Vice Rector III added that USU must coordinate in synergy and see what things have yet to be achieved in internationalization.

"The next step must also be intense coordination in synergy, looking again at what internationalization achievements have not yet been realized. Develop a new program based on input from friends, especially from UNAIR," he said.

On the same occasion, Prof. dr. M. Miftahussurur, M.Kes., Sp.Pd-KEGH., Ph.D., FINASIM, vice-rector for the internationalization of UNAIR, said that all universities in Indonesia must see the importance of internationalization. The discussion is also expected to bring fresh air to both parties.

"I think all universities in Indonesia see the importance of internationalization to achieve World Class University. So today's internationalization discussion is expected to provide the same wind, looking for the best point of cooperation between USU and UNAIR. And, of course, we have been cooperating for a long time. This is only a strengthening process. And leap together for the internationalization program, "he said.

The following coordination will be held next month with the entire forum of vice-rectors of cooperation throughout Indonesia in Palu. This discussion will discuss how to make all Indonesian universities good enough to achieve grand international.
