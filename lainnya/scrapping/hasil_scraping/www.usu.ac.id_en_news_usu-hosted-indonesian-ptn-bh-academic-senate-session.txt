This is also a moment of opportunity to present the ideas of 16 PTN-BH towards establishing the success of their MBKM with an emphasis on the Community Outreach Program.

HUMAS USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted the Plenary Session of the Legal Entity State College Academic Senate Assembly (MSA PTN-BH) which was held on 16-17 September 2022 at the Khas Parapat Hotel, Lake Toba, Simalungun Regency, North Sumatra. Chair and Secretary of the Academic Senate, Chair/Secretary of the Academic Senate Commission from 16 PTN-BH with a total of 127 participants.

The implementation of the trial took the title Identification of Problems and Solutions to the Implementation of Community Service in Supporting the Success of Independent Learning at the Merdeka Campus (MBKM).

As is known, the implementation of MBKM is one of the scope of duties and functions of the Academic Senate in every university. Coordination and collaboration between universities, especially those with PTN-BH status, is considered important to maximize the implementation of the MBKM program.

The activity also featured a discussion session by presenting three source-speakers, namely Plt. Director of Learning and Student Affairs Kemendikbud and Research and Technology Dr. Ir. Sri Gunani Partiwi, MT brought the topic of Community Service Policy in Supporting the Success of MBKM, and USU Vice Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Hasibuan with the topic of Problem Identification and Solutions to the Implementation of Community Service in Supporting the Success of MBKM (Case Study at the Universitas Sumatera Utara).

This is also a moment of opportunity to present the ideas of 16 PTN-BH towards establishing the success of their MBKM with the emphasis on the Community Outreach Program. The implementation of this MBKM leads to Community Service which is routinely carried out by lecturers.

Through this meeting, recommendations were made so that lecturers also involve students in carrying out Community Service as a form of responsibility for implementing Tri Darma. This is expected to create students who experience an increase in employee ability and reputation in the eyes of industry and society.

When students have graduated can be directly be absorbed by the world of work or the creativity that students present can open up job opportunities. Thus, through the improvement of the Community Service program, it is hoped that it will create highly adaptive intellectual resources in the course of people's lives. So that, through this meeting we can make a contribution to complete the Community Service program of each PTN-BH. (©ULC)
