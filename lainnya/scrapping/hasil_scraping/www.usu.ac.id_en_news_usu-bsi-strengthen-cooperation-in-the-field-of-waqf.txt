From a financial and intellectual perspective. And, InshaAllah, with this, the cooperation will continue to grow, said Affan.

 

 

USU Public Relations – Universitas Sumatera Utara, in collaboration with Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI), held a meeting to discuss the development of the banking sector in the field of waqf. The meeting took place at the Rector’s Audience Room of USU on Monday (25/03/2024).

 

On this occasion, the Rector stated that the collaboration between USU and BSI, which has been ongoing, plays an essential role for Universitas Sumatera Utara and expressed hope that it would continue to expand into other sectors.

 

"Whatever can be collaborated on, should be collaborated on," said the Rector.

 

Affan Mawardi, Regional CEO of BSI Region 2 Medan, noted that USU has great potential to collaborate with BSI. One of the key initiatives to be developed is the Cash Waqf Linked Deposit, which functions as a funding mechanism that can be used for various purposes, including scholarship distribution and other social activities.

 

"From both financial and intellectual perspectives. And, InshaAllah, with this, the collaboration will continue to grow," said Affan.

 

Furthermore, Affan added that this collaboration is targeted to launch the Cash Waqf Linked Deposit program within the next two months, with the hope that all related matters will be well-executed and meet the required standards.

 

"InshaAllah, in one or two months, we will officially launch the Cash Waqf Linked Deposit program with USU," he added.
