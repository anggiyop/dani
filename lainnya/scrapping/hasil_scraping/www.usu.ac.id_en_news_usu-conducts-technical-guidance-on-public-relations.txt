With this, we hope that the motivation of the staff of USU public relations team will be stronger and they will be able to have new fresh ideas because the university officials highly expect this," said the Rector of USU.

HUMAS USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) organised a Public Relations Technical Guidance entitled "Managing Higher Education Reputation Through Strategic Work of Public Relations" at the Academic Senate Room of USU Central Bureau of Administration on Wednesday (8/2/2023).

In his speech, Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, explained the important role of public relations for an organisation. For this reason, the USU Rector hopes that USU Public Relations officers, through this technical guidance of public relations, can present other fresh ideas that are expected by USU officials and can make the university proud through the reputation that is formed.

"With this, we hope that the motivation of the staff of USU public relations team will be stronger and they will be able to have new fresh ideas because the university officials highly expect this," said the Rector of USU.

In the Technical Guidance of Public Relations, USU invited a guest speaker, the CEO of Indonesian Public Relations. Asmono Wikan explained the points discussed in his presentation, such as the function and strategic position of public relations, public relations as a contributor or the cause of reputation, to the competence of public relations officers who must be increasingly trained through workshops in order to create the University's reputation.

"This reputation is one of the major assets of an organisation to continue to grow and develop. To encourage the success of an organisation's reputation, the public relations team must be competent in learning, training or sharing sessions," said the CEO of Indonesian Public Relations.
