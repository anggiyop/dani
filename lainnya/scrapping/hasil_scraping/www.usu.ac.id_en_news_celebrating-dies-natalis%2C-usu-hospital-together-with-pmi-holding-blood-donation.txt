"By giving a little blood, we have can save the lives of our brothers and sisters out there," dr. RA Dwi Pujiastuti.

USU PR - USU Hospital and the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) are collaborating to hold a blood donation event to celebrate the 6th Anniversary of USU Hospital. The blood donation which was held at USU Hospital on Friday (3/25/2022) was attended by employees, young doctors, Koas students and the general public.

Head of the Committee for Dies Natalis, dr. RA Dwi Pujiastuti, SpS(K) said the 6th Anniversary commemoration was actually a momentum to channel a sense of concern for others and the outside community.

"By giving a little blood, we have can save the lives of our brothers and sisters out there," dr. RA Dwi Pujiastuti said.

According to her, awareness of the benefits and importance of blood donation must be increased so that there is no longer a shortage of blood bags for humanitarian needs. In addition to humanitarian activities, these donor activities also provide health benefits for donors.

 “These benefits include increasing blood cell production, improving blood circulation, and maintaining heart health. In addition, blood donation is also said to improve mental health," she explained.

In line with this, the Chairperson of the Association of Internal Medicine Expert Assistants (IKAAPDA) USU Faculty of Medicine, dr. Hafiz Syaifullah Siregar, hopes for public awareness of the importance of blood donation during the pandemic.

"When the pandemic is very difficult to get blood, so hope that many people donate blood and care for fellow humans," dr. Hafiz said.

Since 2021, USU Hospital has routinely held blood donation activities 3-4 times a year. In addition to blood donation activities, in this anniversary there will also be webinars, bazaars, and visits to orphanages. The peak of the celebration will fall on March 30, 2022. (©ULC)
