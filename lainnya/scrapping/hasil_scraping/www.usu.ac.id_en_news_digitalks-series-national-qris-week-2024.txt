“The benefits are quite large because this activity can increase understanding of financial digitalization, especially for USU students, and this is the second year. I hope that next year there will be more because USU students are Agents Of Chance, added Prof Poppy.”

USU PR - In the framework of Medan Digi Fest and National Qris Week 2024, Bank Indonesia (BI) collaborated with the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) to hold a Digitalks Series. Themed “Konsumen Cerdas PeKa Bertransaksi,” this activity was successfully held at the Pancasila Building USU on Friday, 16/08/2024.

 

Suharman Tabrani as Deputy Representative of Bank Indonesia of North Sumatra Province in his speech said that Indonesia as the system authority continues to make various efforts to ensure the development and continuation of the shadow side in Indonesia, especially digitalization.

 

Suharman Tabrani added that this is the second time Digi Fest has been held at the Universitas Sumatera Utara, where this year, is promoting a digital payment experience that targets students and the younger generation as the biggest digital payment users. Therefore, students need to have the right understanding of this.

 

“Now, students or the younger generation are the largest users of digital payments. For this reason, we heard at the digital fest that you must have a proper and qualified understanding of how to make transactions, what the benefits are and the risks so that they are really understood so that we avoid negative risks,” explained Suharman.

 

Vice Rector III of USU, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt added that she fully supports this activity which is also able to help students in increasing digital understanding and hopes that this activity will be routinely carried out because students are agents of opportunity who are able to bring change, especially in the field of financial digitalization.

 

“The benefits are quite large because this activity can increase understanding of financial digitalization, especially for USU students, and this is the second year I hope next year there will be more because USU students are Agents Of Chance,” added Prof Poppy.

 

For information, this event also invited GoTo Financial's Head of Corporate Affairs, Audrey P Pasaribu, and Nicholas Shaputra, who are public figures, as speakers.
