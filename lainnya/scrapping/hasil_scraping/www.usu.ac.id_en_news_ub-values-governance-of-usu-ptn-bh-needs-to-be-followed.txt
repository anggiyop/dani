"With the arrival of guests, we can share information about management especially letter management and other governance related to managing a PTN-BH," Prof. Fidel said.

USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from Universitas Brawijaya (UB). The visit was welcomed by the Secretary of the University Prof.Dr.dr.Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar.M.Ked(OG),Sp.OG(K), Monday (11/14/2022).

UB's visit to USU was carried out in the framework of benchmarking regarding the status of Legal Entity Higher Education (PTN-BH) which has been held by UB based on Government Regulation Number 108 of 2021. Previously several universities had also carried out benchmarking at USU regarding PTN-BH. UB itself considers that the management of USU's PTN-BH is one of the best so that it wants to emulate what USU has done.

In response to this, USU University Secretary Prof.Dr.dr.Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar.M.Ked(OG),Sp.OG(K) welcomed the arrival of the guest university and considered this to be a moment to share information, especially to manage PTN-BH .

"With the arrival of guests, we can share information about management especially letter management and other governance related to managing a PTN-BH," Prof. Fidel said.

The USU University Secretary hopes that the cooperative relationship between USU and UB and other universities that have visited USU can be more closely intertwined so that they are able to manage PTN-BH well.

"Collaboration is getting closer, friendship between us is closely intertwined, sharing information with each other so that we can manage this PTN-BH well," he said.

Secretary of UB University Dr. Ir. Setyono Yudo Tyasmoro, M.S. Thank you for USU's welcome on the benchmarking visit. He said that before becoming a PTN-BH, UB also consulted USU.

“Our PTN BH which have just been established this year can learn more and be able to catch up with other BH PTNs, including from USU," he explained.

This activity discussed the implementation of university administration at the rectorate level, administrative procedures from a legal standpoint applicable at USU, as well as the obstacles faced by USU after switching to PTN-BH. The Secretary of UB University details these matters, including regarding how to manage business personnel, public relations, archives, and asset management.

"With PTN-BH, assets no longer belong to us but are lent to us by the state, so how can USU do that so that we don't experience difficulties in managing it," Dr. Setyono explained.

For information, apart from Brawijaya University, previously USU had received a benchmarking visit regarding PTN-BH conducted by UIN Sunan Kalijaga and then UPI Bandung. (©ULC)
