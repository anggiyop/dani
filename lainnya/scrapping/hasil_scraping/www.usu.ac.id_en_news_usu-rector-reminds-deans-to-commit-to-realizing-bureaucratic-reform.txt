The Rector hopes that all services can be provided and implemented properly, in accordance with the rules, not for long, transparent and following the existing provisions. The Rector also expressed his hope that all services would become a digital system.

PR USU - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., reminded the deans to be committed to realizing bureaucratic reform at the university. This was conveyed by the Rector on Coffee Morning "Submission of the USU Bureaucratic Reform Road Map Book and ZI-WBK/WBBM Development Guidebook" at the USU Administration Bureau Central Building, Tuesday (9/28/2021).

The Rector added several important things that must be done in the eight areas of reform of the ZI-WBK bureaucracy. “First, we need leadership commitment. The leader must demonstrate and know the details of the existing services. Second, the preparation of SOPs. Third, it is carried out continuously and evaluated, the service must not be interrupted," said the Rector.

The Rector hopes that all services can be provided and implemented properly, in accordance with the rules, not for long, transparent and following the existing provisions. The Rector also expressed his hope that all services would become a digital system.

“For the past five years, we have prepared all the foundations. So that the 6th or 7th year of our service will no longer use paper or require meeting people,” he said.

On that occasion, the Rector also handed over the USU Bureaucratic Reform Road Map and ZI-WBK/WBBM Development Guidebooks to the deans. The Road Map book serves as a guide for faculty leaders to implement eight areas of bureaucratic reform.

Head of the USU Bureaucratic Reform Team, Dr. Nurman Achmad, said USU was ready to implement bureaucratic reform, "We have received two assessments, our files are good. We have also surveyed. In the near future there will be a survey verification. At the same time, there is an online assessment of the Nursing Faculty WBK. After that, there will be an assessment from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Nurman added that until now, university leaders are very committed to realizing bureaucratic reform. "Because one of the conditions for achieving WBK is a commitment from the leadership," said the Expert Staff of the Rector for Bureaucratic Reform and Public Service.

On this occasion, the Chairperson of the USU ZI-WBK, Dr. Rulianda Purnomo Wibowo, SP, MEc, presented material related to the ZI-WBK development at the Universitas Sumatera Utara. Dr. Rulianda also conveyed about eight areas of change in bureaucratic reform, including mindset, institutions, regulations and legislation, human resources of the apparatus, management, accountability, supervision, and public services.

“The ZI-WBK team was formed to disseminate information to all work units. Later, work plans and indicators will be set that must be met by all units to achieve ZI-WBK. Then a unit will be appointed as a model for other units, "explained Rulianda. (©ULC)
