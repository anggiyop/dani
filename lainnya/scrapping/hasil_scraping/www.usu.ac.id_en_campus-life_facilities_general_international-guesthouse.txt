International Guesthouse

The USU International Guesthouse is an 18-room facility on the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) campus. It is an essential facility for foreign lecturers who will be teaching at USU, as well as for improving the overall quality of the university. The guesthouse has been renovated and equipped with facilities that meet international standards, including guest rooms, swimming pools, a cafe, and soon to be added a fitness center. The USU International Guesthouse is expected to be a comfortable place, serve as a business center for foreign lecturers, and provide a conducive environment for cultural exchange in an academic setting.
