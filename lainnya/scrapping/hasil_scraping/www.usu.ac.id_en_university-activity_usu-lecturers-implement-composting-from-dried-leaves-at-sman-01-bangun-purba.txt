Sekolah Menengah Atas Negeri (SMAN) 01 Bangun Purba is one of the schools located in Bangun Purba District, Deli Serdang Regency, North Sumatra Province, which has an area of approximately 2.05 hectares (20512 m2). The number of green areas in the school environment makes SMAN 01 Bangun Purba a very comfortable place to learn. However, the problem of leaf waste also arises, along with the many trees in the neighborhood.

To overcome the above problems, the Community Service (PKM) team from the Universitas Sumatera Utara implemented the knowledge of processing dry leaf waste into compost with a fermentation process. In this case, in addition to the transfer of knowledge of processing dry leaf waste into compost, the PKM USU team also assisted in the form of making a compost house with a size of 3x4 m (concrete permanan), digital scales, soil thermometers, and activator materials for making compost, namely EM4, manure, and molasses.

The service team was led by Dr. Susilawati, M.Si., a lecturer in the Physics Study Program of FMIPA USU, and was held on August 28, 2021 at SMAN 01 Bangun Purba. This activity was attended by the principal, teachers, and students of SMAN 01 Bangun Purba.

“The potential of SMAN 01 Bangun Purba to produce compost is very large, considering that the leaf waste produced is very large every day, around ± 50 kg per day. However, the school does not utilize this leaf waste because it does not know how to manage it. Leaf waste is only swept up and disposed of in the school landfill and then burned, which can actually cause environmental pollution,” said Dr. Susilawati, M.Si.

According to Dr. Susilawati, from the discussion with the school principal, this program is long-awaited by SMAN 01 Bangun Purba because the school has already bought a shredder. However, they do not know technically how to make compost and do not have a house for making compost. In addition to Dr. Susilawati, this service activity was also attended by other service members, namely Siti Utari Rahayu, M.Sc, Faturrahman, M.Si., Ilfa Husna Pulungan, M.Si., who are lecturers and laboratory assistants from USU.

Dekson, S.Pd., as the Principal of SMAN 01 Bangun Purba said that the transfer of compost processing knowledge is indeed needed by SMAN 01 Bangun Purba, to empower the dry leaf waste at SMAN 01 Bangun Purba. “We already know how to process this dry leaf waste and bought a chopping machine. However, we do not know how to properly make compost from dry leaf waste and need help building the compost house, so this Community Service activity held by USU is very useful for us. In the future, we also plan to create a Waste Bank if the Rumah Kompos Program is already well underway,” said Pak Dedi.

The teachers and students seemed very enthusiastic about participating in this PKM activity. They actively helped make compost from dry leaf waste. The activity ended with the composting equipment and materials handover to the Principal of SMAN 01 Bangun Purba. (RJ)
