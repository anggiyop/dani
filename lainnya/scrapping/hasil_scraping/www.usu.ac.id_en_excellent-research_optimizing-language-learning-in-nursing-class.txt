This study explores the use of translanguaging in teaching English for Specific Purposes (ESP) to nursing students in Indonesia. Findings reveal that the approach enhances comprehension, confidence, and student engagement in the learning process.

In the field of education, language often serves as a bridge between teaching and understanding. With the advancement of time and the development of technology, more innovative approaches are being used to enhance the quality of learning, particularly in language education. One such approach that has gained increasing popularity is translanguaging. This approach allows students to utilize their entire linguistic repertoire, including both their first language (L1) and second language (L2), to understand the material being taught. Beyond language learning benefits, translanguaging also brings positive impacts in various educational contexts, including in teaching English for Specific Purposes (ESP) at the higher education level.

 

Translanguaging, which fundamentally refers to the use of two or more languages in a single learning context, aims to create a more inclusive learning environment and ease students’ comprehension of materials that may be difficult to grasp using only one language. In many situations, especially in non-English-speaking countries, English instruction is often restricted by monolingual policies that require the exclusive use of English as the primary medium of instruction. However, these policies frequently face major challenges, particularly when students have varying levels of English proficiency or when the subject matter is highly technical and requires in-depth understanding.

 

In Indonesia, translanguaging is beginning to be implemented in some universities, especially in ESP programs for nursing, where students are expected to master medical English used in professional settings. Nursing, as a highly technical field closely tied to medical practice, requires not just everyday English but also an understanding of complex medical terminology that can be difficult to comprehend without further explanation. This is where translanguaging plays a crucial role, helping students grasp these terms by using a language they are more familiar with—Bahasa Indonesia.

 

A study conducted by Rohdearni Wati Sipayung (Universitas Simalungun Indonesia), Prof. Erikson Saragih and Prof. Mahriyuni (Universitas Sumatera Utara Indonesia), and Roswani Siregar (Universitas Al-Azhar Medan Indonesia), involved 150 nursing students and 5 ESP instructors. The study aimed to explore how translanguaging is received and implemented in ESP classrooms, particularly in the nursing field. A mixed-methods approach was used, combining direct observations, semi-structured interviews, and surveys to collect data from both students and instructors. The findings revealed that translanguaging was positively received by the majority of students, who felt more comfortable and confident when allowed to use both Bahasa Indonesia and English during the learning process.

 

Students reported that they found it easier to understand the materials when instructors used both languages. In some instances, instructors used Bahasa Indonesia to explain complex medical terms or concepts before elaborating in English. For example, a medical term like “high blood pressure” was first introduced in Bahasa Indonesia, followed by further explanation in English. This helped students better understand the context and meaning of such terms, which is critical in the nursing profession.

 

Furthermore, translanguaging helped students build confidence in communicating in English. Many students felt anxious or hesitant when asked to speak in English, especially when they lacked full command of medical vocabulary. By using Bahasa Indonesia as a bridge, they were able to reduce anxiety and focus more on understanding the material. This process also encouraged greater participation in class discussions, as students felt more capable of expressing their opinions and asking questions.

 

“Translanguaging not only benefits students, but also instructors. In this study, instructors reported that it helped them explain materials more clearly, especially for students with lower English proficiency,” said Prof. Erikson Saragih.

Instructors found that using Bahasa Indonesia as a support tool in teaching medical English improved students’ understanding of complex topics. Additionally, it facilitated easier interaction between instructors and students, creating a more engaging and enjoyable classroom environment. 

 

One major advantage of translanguaging is its ability to facilitate social interaction in the classroom. In such settings, instructors not only serve as knowledge providers but also as facilitators who create a collaborative atmosphere among students.

According to Prof. Erikson Saragih, by allowing the use of both languages, instructors give students the freedom to speak more openly, ask questions without fear, and discuss materials in a way that is easier for them to understand. This fosters a sense of belonging, enhances peer solidarity, and enriches social interactions, ultimately deepening students’ understanding of the content.

 

However, despite its many benefits, translanguaging also faces certain challenges. One major obstacle is the prevailing language policy that prioritizes English as the main language of instruction. In many educational institutions in Indonesia, English-only policies are still strongly upheld, particularly in the context of ESP and English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI). These policies aim to improve students' English proficiency but often face the reality that not all students possess the language skills needed to fully understand the materials.

 

“Some instructors in this study expressed concern that translanguaging could hinder students from properly learning English. They believe that using Bahasa Indonesia in teaching may reduce students’ opportunities to fully acquire English skills, which are crucial for their future professional careers. They worry that if Bahasa Indonesia is used too frequently, students might not be sufficiently exposed to English to achieve the fluency required in the workplace,” explained Prof. Erikson Saragih.

 

Nonetheless, despite such concerns, many instructors still recognize the importance of using translanguaging in specific contexts. They believe it is highly beneficial when explaining complex concepts or highly technical medical terminology that may be difficult to grasp using English alone.Prof. Erikson Saragih emphasized that translanguaging is not about reducing the use of English, but rather about facilitating a better understanding of the materials being taught. Translanguaging enables students to more easily access and engage with knowledge, which in turn can strengthen their English language proficiency.

 

“Translanguaging is not merely a teaching technique, but an inclusive learning strategy. By allowing students to use languages they are comfortable with, translanguaging fosters a more supportive and open learning environment,” said Prof. Erikson Saragih.

 

This is particularly important in higher education, where students come from diverse linguistic backgrounds and may have limitations in English proficiency. In this regard, translanguaging is not just about language—it is about making learning more accessible by connecting it to students’ experiences and cultural contexts.

 

This study highlights how the use of translanguaging in ESP classrooms—particularly in nursing—can enrich students’ learning experiences. Students do not just learn English as a communication tool; they also acquire essential medical concepts for their future careers. Through translanguaging, they are able to connect their English language knowledge with their local context, making the learning process more relevant and meaningful.
