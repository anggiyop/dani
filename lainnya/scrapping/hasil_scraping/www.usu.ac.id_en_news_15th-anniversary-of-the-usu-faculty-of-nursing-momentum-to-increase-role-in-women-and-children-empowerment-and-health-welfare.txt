“Hopefully, the Faculty of Nursing USU can continue to produce competent health professionals and contribute to improving the health status of the community,” said Prof. Opim.

USU PR - The Faculty of Nursing of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (FKEP USU) held a Scientific Oration as part of the 15th Anniversary celebration which took place on Tuesday (19/11/2024) at the FKEP USU Hall. The event was attended by university leaders, teaching staff, education staff, students, and a number of invited guests.

 

This year's anniversary carries the theme “Women's Empowerment in Improving the Welfare of Mothers and Children in North Sumatra Province”. This theme reflects the commitment of the USU Faculty of Nursing to contribute to public health development, especially through increasing the role of women as pillars of family health.

 

In his remarks, Vice Rector IV of USU, Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., congratulated the USU Faculty of Nursing on its 15-year journey full of achievements. He hopes that in the future, the USU Faculty of Nursing can continue to produce competent health professionals and contribute to improving public health status. Prof. Opim also emphasized that women's empowerment has a direct impact on reducing maternal mortality, improving child nutrition, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) points 3, 5, and 10.

 

“Hopefully, the Faculty of Nursing USU can continue to produce competent health professionals and contribute to improving the degree of public health,” said Prof. Opim.

 

Dean of the Faculty of Nursing USU, Dr. Dudut Tanjung, S.Kp., M.Kep., Sp.KMB, said that the faculty was officially established on June 23, 2009, through the Decree of the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara. Currently, the Faculty manages three study programs, namely Undergraduate Program in Nursing, Nursing Profession, and Master Program in Nursing with five specializations. He also revealed plans to open specialist and doctoral programs in the future. During its 15 years of existence, the Faculty has achieved various achievements, including the Corruption Free Zone (ZI-WBK) title and superior accreditation from LAM-PTKes for all its study programs. In the last five years, the faculty has produced 1,633 graduates, with an increase in the average GPA above 3.50 since 2021.

 

However, the Dean of FKep USU also highlighted several challenges, such as a decrease in the number of students in the Master of Nursing program and not maximizing the graduation of first takers of the Ners competency test, which needs to be improved. The Faculty also actively collaborates with various parties, including local governments, hospitals, and international institutions such as JICA Japan, PSU Thailand, and universities in Australia. In addition, the faculty manages SINTA-accredited journals to encourage quality scientific publications.

 

“We continue to develop the curriculum and improve the quality of learning to make it more effective and relevant,” said Dr. Dudut.

 

Sri Suriani Purnamawati, S.Si., Apt., M.Kes., Head of the Women's Empowerment, Child Protection, and Family Planning Office of North Sumatra Province, in her scientific oration emphasized the importance of synergy to optimize regional potential in women's empowerment.

 

“This anniversary is not only a celebration, but also a moment of reflection to strengthen our commitment to face health challenges,” said Sri.

 

Through the momentum of the 15th Anniversary, FKep USU is expected to continue to advance and become a pioneer in empowering women and improving the welfare of mothers and children, in line with its vision to become a superior nursing education institution.
