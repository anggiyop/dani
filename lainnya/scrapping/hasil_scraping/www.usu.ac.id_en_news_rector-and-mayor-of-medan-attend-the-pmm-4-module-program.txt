"It will have a significant positive impact on the participants, and the collaboration between the PMM participants during their time at the Universitas Sumatera Utara will become stronger and more solid," said Prof. Mury.

USU PR—The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) welcomed the Mayor of Medan, Bobby Nasution, as the keynote speaker at the Nusantara Module Program for the Free Student Exchange (PMM) Batch 4 of the Even Semester, Academic Year 2023/2024. The students enthusiastically received the event at the Digital Learning Center Building, 1st Floor, USU, on (May 20, 2024)

190 students from 52 universities across Indonesia attended the event. The program focused on learning about Indonesia's multicultural aspects, particularly in the city of Medan. It aimed to promote the understanding that differences among individuals strengthen unity. Additionally, the students received training on leadership skills.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., the Rector of USU, stated that the student's presence at the event truly represented Indonesia, with its diverse islands, ethnicities, and religions. He hoped this program would positively impact and further enhance collaboration between the PMM participants and USU.

"It will have a significant positive impact on the participants, and the collaboration between the PMM participants during their time at the Universitas Sumatera Utara will become stronger and more solid," he said.

Medan is known as a multicultural city that is comprised of various diverse areas. According to Mayor Bobby Nasution, this diversity is a valuable asset that should be preserved and maintained. All ethnicities and religions should live together harmoniously.

"Of course, we want all ethnicities in Medan to be proud of their unique characteristics and be able to achieve great things," he said.

Dr. Muhammad Taufik, S.Si., M.Si., the Moderator and Field Assistance Lecturer (DPL), mentioned that the PMM students who come from outside Medan can learn many things through the module activities focused on diversity, reflection, inspiration, and social contribution.

"This campus independence activity, the Nusantara module, is one of the activities that can enhance students' leadership skills at this time," he said.

Ushi Mugi, one of the PMM students from Padjadjaran University, expressed hope for better learning systems in the future, both within their departments and faculties.
