"This is just a fun event and you don't need to think about it too much. There is music, door prizes and other entertainment," the Rector said.

Public Relation USU - The Fun Walk event in commemoration of the 51st Anniversary of the Indonesian Civil Service Corps (Korpri) at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) took place lively. The activity, which was centered on the courtyard of the USU Central Administrative Bureau Building, Saturday (12/03/2022) was filled with healthful activities such as healthy walks, gymnastics, prizes distribution and attended by all USU academics.

Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin., S.Sos., M.Si explained that the commemoration of the 51st anniversary of the Indonesian Civil Service Corps (Korpri) with the theme "Korpri Serving, Contributing and Innovating for the Nation" is an annual agenda that is carried out.

The Rector of USU also congratulated Korpri for turning 51 on November 29. The Rector advised that participants in the 2022 Fun Walk activities could enjoy the event.

"This is just a fun event and you don't need to think about it too much. There is music, door prizes and so on," the Rector said.

Chairman of the USU Korpri Prof. Dr. Harry Agusnar, MSc. explained that the 2022 Fun Walk event, which was attended by university leaders, faculties, and Korpri employees at USU, was the first time that it had been held by USU's Korpri after being suspended for 2 years due to the pandemic.

In his report, the Chairman of Korpri thanked the donors who had contributed in organizing this activity.

He also explained, Fun Walk 2022 has a short route because there are still a series of other activities to be carried out.

"I would like to thank the donors who have provided their assistance so that it was carried out so successfully," he explained.

Apart from the Fun Walk, the commemoration of Korpri's 51st Anniversary at USU was also enlivened by a series of other entertainments such as Zumba gymnastics, lucky draw with door prizes worth millions of rupiah, then the 360 ​​spinning camera booth. The rain that fell during the activity did not seem to dampen the enthusiasm of the 2022 Fun Walk participants.

The success behind the excitement of the Fun Walk 2022 was not spared from the support of sponsors including Bank Mandiri, Bank BNI, Bank Sumut, Bank BTN and Grab. (©ULC)
