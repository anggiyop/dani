"The faculty has prepared adequate classroom facilities, as well as supporting facilities in preventing Covid-19 such as hand washing facilities, temperature measuring devices and classroom sterilization. Classrooms have ventilation, distance arrangements as well as scheduling and distribution of shifts for students who enter offline," Dr. Inke said.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Covid-19 Task Force assessed that face-to-face lectures which will be held on February 7, 2022, can already be implemented. Based on the observations of the USU Covid-19 Task Force Team, every faculty is eligible to start a Limited PTM.

Deputy Chair of the USU Cocid-19 Task Force, dr. Inke Nadia D. Lubis, M.Ked(Ped), SpA, PhD when reviewing the Faculty of Humanities (FIB) related to PTM Limited, Thursday (1/13/2022) assessed that the various preparations made by the faculty had been almost optimal.

"The faculty has prepared adequate classroom facilities, as well as supporting facilities in preventing Covid-19 such as hand washing facilities, temperature measuring devices and classroom sterilization. Classrooms have ventilation, distance arrangements as well as scheduling and distribution of shifts for students who enter offline," Dr. Inke said.

She explained that even though the facilities and infrastructure had been optimally prepared, the risk of transmission still existed so that the health protocols were still implemented in the implementation of limited PTM.

Dean of the Faculty of Cultural Sciences Dr. Tengku Thyrhaya Zein, MA said that the faculty was ready to conduct limited face-to-face learning (PTM). It started with a fairly strong coordination between the faculty's Covid-19 task force and the deputy deans.

"FIB has formed a Covid task force and is ready to face lectures in a hybrid way. We have coordinated with the head of the Covid-19 task force and then with the deputy deans, especially the deputy deans I and II," she explained.

Accompanied by Deputy Dean I Prof. Mauly Purba, Deputy Dean II Heristina Dewi, M.Pd and Deputy Dean III Mhd Pujiono, PhD and the Chair of the Covid-19 FIB Task Force, the dean emphasized that FIB would complete the lack of facilities and arrange lecture schedules and more strict entry and exit flow.

During his visit, the USU Covid-19 Task Force Team checked several lecture rooms, the availability of air ventilation, temperature gauges, QR barcodes and hand washing facilities. The conclusion is that FIB is ready to implement Limited PTM. (©ULC)
