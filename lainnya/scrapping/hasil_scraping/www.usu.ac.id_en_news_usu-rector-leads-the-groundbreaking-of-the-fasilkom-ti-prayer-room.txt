The Rector explained that the function of this prayer room is to make it easier for all Fasilkom-TI academics to find a special area to carry out worship or gather in order to hold regular spiritual meetings.

PR USU - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, inaugurated the Al-Khuwarizmi Musala with the symbol of laying the first stone at the Faculty of Computer Science-Information Technology (Fasilkom-TI), on Monday (08/08/2022). The Rector of USU said that the establishment of a prayer room is a means of worship which can also be used as a medium to increase understanding and religious activities of Muslims.

The Rector explained that the function of this prayer room is to make it easier for all Fasilkom-TI academics to find a special area to carry out worship or gather in order to hold regular spiritual meetings.

The Rector also said that this prayer room will be built in a modern minimalist style and is expected to be able to produce digital technology products that are useful for the benefit of the people and the Indonesian nation and hopes that this prayer room can be completed as soon as possible, so that it can be used properly.

"I hope the prayer room can be completed on time so that it can be done soon," he said.

Head of Al-Khwarizmi Mushala Development Management Dr. Eng Ade Candra, ST., M.Kom said, Fasilkom-TI collaborated with engineering academics majoring in USU architects to get the design of Musala Al-Khwarizmi by aligning all the buildings in Fasilkom-TI. (©ULC)
