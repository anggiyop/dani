“The Racing Payroll program is to increase the balance in customer accounts, especially for USU employees with Bank Mandiri accounts. In addition, it is also to increase transactions and collect points. We will pull the transaction data later, and 10 names with the highest average balance and month-end balance will be selected as winners,” explained Benedicta Arsita Nugrahadewi, Head of Bank Mandiri KCP USU.

 

Public Relations USU—The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and Bank Mandiri successfully held the Bank Mandiri Payroll Racing Reward Submission event in 2024. This event took place in the Video Conference Room, 3rd Floor of the USU Rector Bureau, on Tuesday (21/01/2025) as a form of appreciation to USU employees who actively transact through Bank Mandiri services.

“The Racing Payroll program is to increase the balance in customer accounts, especially for USU employees with Bank Mandiri accounts. In addition, it is also to increase transactions and collect points. We will pull the transaction data later, and 10 names with the highest average balance and month-end balance will be selected as winners,” explained Benedicta Arsita Nugrahadewi, Head of Bank Mandiri KCP USU.

Benedicta continued, “For period 1, this program runs from April 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024. I congratulate the 10 USU employees who were selected as winners with a total prize of Rp25,000,000 in the form of shopping vouchers with nominal values ranging from Rp600,000 to Rp7,500,000. We hope that this program can benefit the winners, and for those who have not been selected, hopefully, motivated to increase their savings balance in the next period.”

In his remarks, Marthin Luther Tarigan, S.T., Head of USU Finance, said, “This program not only motivates employees to be more active in using Bank Mandiri services, but also supports various university financial needs, such as UKT and IP student payments. We appreciate this cooperation and hope similar programs can continue to be improved.”

Benedicta also expressed hope regarding the sustainability of the Bank Mandiri and USU collaboration. “We have collaborated with USU several times and want to continue this collaboration. In 2025, more new programs will be designed together. We also talked to Mr. Marthin about this earlier,” he said.

In closing, Benedicta delivered a rhyme, “Buy your own martabak, don't forget to drink teh tarik. Increase your balance at Bank Mandiri, and bring home attractive prizes.”
