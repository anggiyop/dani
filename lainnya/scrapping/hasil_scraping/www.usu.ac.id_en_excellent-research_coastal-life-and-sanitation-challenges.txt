This research reveals the serious sanitation problems faced by Indonesia's coastal communities, such as in Percut Sei Tuan Sub-district, North Sumatra. With a holistic approach, better sanitation can improve the quality of life of coastal communities.

As the sun rises in the east, the coastline appears beautiful, adorned with orange rays reflecting on the surface of the sea. Children run along the sand, their joyous laughter mingling with the sound of the waves. However, behind this idyllic scene, there lies a harsh reality often hidden from those who only see the coast as a tourist destination. Upon closer examination of several coastal areas in Indonesia, it becomes evident that the daily lives of these communities are fraught with serious challenges—none more pressing than poor sanitation management.

Indonesia, as the largest archipelago in the world, is home to thousands of coastal communities. Unfortunately, many of these coastal populations continue to struggle with urgent environmental hygiene issues, from unsafe drinking water to the prevalent practice of open defecation. This issue is not merely about sanitation; it concerns basic human rights and the right to a dignified life.

Percut Sei Tuan District in North Sumatra Province is one such example, where the sanitation problems of coastal communities are glaring. These issues prompted Susilawati, R. Hamdani Harahap, Miswar Budi Mulya, and Lita Sri Andayani to carry out their community service obligation as part of the Tri Dharma of higher education. They highlighted the dire state of sanitation management in this coastal area. In fact, only 7.42% of households in Indonesia have access to safe and equitable sanitation. Meanwhile, approximately 25.42% still lack adequate sanitation, and 9.36% continue to practice open defecation without proper facilities, painting a stark picture of the urgent situation. Many families live in conditions far below acceptable sanitation standards, a situation that directly contradicts the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The coastal communities of Percut Sei Tuan not only face economic challenges but also severe health risks. The poor sanitation system directly impacts their health. Researchers found that due to inadequate hygiene conditions, many residents suffer from various health issues, including waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. “These conditions not only threaten health but also lives, especially for children who are more vulnerable to infections due to unhygienic environments,” explained Susilawati in her research.

This study also emphasized that women, as caretakers of households and family health, play a crucial role in sanitation management. The challenges they face include limited access to adequate sanitation facilities, often forcing them to make extra efforts to maintain family hygiene. Unfortunately, these efforts are often insufficient, especially when the surrounding environment does not support them. The role of the government and community leaders in addressing this issue has been deemed insufficient. Although numerous initiatives have been undertaken, the results remain suboptimal. Community leaders and religious figures, who ideally should act as drivers of behavioral change at the grassroots level, often play only marginal roles in improving environmental sanitation.

The research data not only depict the alarming state of sanitation but also attempt to understand the factors that influence community behavior in managing their sanitation. Remarkably, the study involved more than 500,000 households, with 414 randomly selected as samples to obtain representative data. This research revealed that factors such as residential status, gender roles, stakeholder involvement, infrastructure, and socio-cultural and economic factors all contribute to community sanitation behavior. One key finding was that social and cultural practices strongly influence sanitation behavior. Cultural values and norms within a community can affect how they view cleanliness and health.

“For instance, in communities with strong traditional values, open defecation may be considered normal and not something that needs to be addressed. This is where community and religious leaders should step in to educate the public that poor sanitation can affect the health of the entire community,” explained Hamdani, a researcher involved in the study.

However, this issue cannot be resolved without adequate infrastructure. While the community may wish to change their behavior, without available facilities, such changes are difficult to achieve. In many coastal areas, access to clean water and proper toilets remains a significant problem. Many households still rely on unsafe water sources or even directly from the sea, which, of course, poses health risks.

In response to these problems, Hamdani and his team proposed one key solution emphasized in this study: the importance of a holistic approach to addressing sanitation issues in coastal areas. Providing facilities alone is not enough; interventions must involve all elements of society, from the government and community leaders to individuals within households.

The government, as the initiator and driver of change, plays a crucial role in providing adequate infrastructure. However, this effort will not succeed without active participation from the community itself. Behavioral change cannot be forced but must be approached through persuasive and educational methods. In this regard, local leaders, such as traditional and religious figures, can serve as effective bridges between government programs and the community.

“On the other hand, the involvement of women in sanitation management must also receive more attention. As those often responsible for household cleanliness, women should be involved in the planning and implementation of sanitation programs. This does not mean that men’s roles can be ignored. The involvement of all parties, including men, is crucial in creating sustainable change,” said Hamdani.

Coastal communities may appear peaceful and serene from the outside, but beneath that surface, many challenges lie. Sanitation is just one of the many problems they face daily. However, this is a fundamental issue, and if addressed properly, it can bring about significant changes in their quality of life. This study shows that with the right approach, such changes are possible. It requires strong cooperation from various parties, from the government providing the facilities to the community willing to change their behavior. Moreover, community leaders must take a more active role in driving change at the grassroots level.

“The hope for the future is that coastal life will not only be known for its natural beauty but also for its cleanliness and healthy environment. With the right support, sanitation in coastal areas can be improved, enabling communities to live healthier and more dignified lives. This change may not happen overnight, but with consistent small steps, a better future for coastal communities is not impossible,” concluded Hamdani.
