DIB considers the firm action taken by USU show that the campus was no longer a safe place to transact drugs. "And at the same time confirming that there is no safe place for this crime," said the USU alumnus.

USU PR - Member of the Regional Representatives Council (DPD) who is also the Chairperson of the Anti-Drug Activist Community (Mapan) DPP Dedi Iskandar Batubara (well-known as DIB) appreciated the steps taken by the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) for daring to take policies to eradicate drugs in the campus environment.

DIB, as his nickname, believes that trafficking in campuses must be fought because drugs destroy the nation's generation. "Drugs of any kind are very detrimental, and this must be fought and the university must dare to take tactical steps to crush its circulation," DIB said in a statement, Wednesday (10/13/2021).

He also appreciated the Provsu National Narcotics Agency for being a partner in cracking down on drugs in the campus environment. "This drug is an extraordinary crime, its effects can be very damaging, and this requires attention and collaboration of all parties," he said.

The chairman of the North Sumatra Al-Washliyah DPW views that the steps taken by USU by cooperating with the National Narcotics Agency to suppress drug trafficking in the campus environment need to be imitated to provide a deterrent effect. "It also changes the paradigm that campus is a safe place to use and transact drugs," he said.

With the firm action taken by USU, DIB considered that the campus was no longer a safe place to transact drugs. "And at the same time confirming that there is no safe place for this crime," said the USU alumnus.

As is known, several days ago USU collaborated with the National Narcotics Agency to fight drugs on campus. Proactively, USU wrote to BNN which was then followed up by BNN Provsu to conduct sweeps in a number of faculties and it was found that dozens of students were netted with three outside USU indicated as dealers.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin in his statement to reporters said USU was coordinating with BNN because drug abuse activities were very disturbing. It will not stop at taking action by the National Narcotics Agency, USU itself will form an Anti-Drug Task Force and Students as a form of prevention. (©ULC)
