This attitude and behaviour describe and represent us. Hopefully, we can follow the process from start to finish and return to our respective campuses again to follow the next learning process, bringing changes and goodness for all of us, said the rector.

HUMAS USU - 38 Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) students will depart for a Student Exchange programme to MARA University of Technology (UiTM) Malaysia. The departure was carried out by USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos M.Si at the Academic Senate Conference Room, USU Central Bureau of Administration Building, Friday (10/3/2023).

The USU Rector said that the student exchange programme is one of the important programmes so that students can experience different academic nuances.

"Why is student exchange important? It is so that you can experience a different academic environment. There are different academic nuances and different academic environments between USU, Indonesia and Malaysia," said Prof Mury.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos, M.Si advised students to maintain their attitude and behaviour during the programme.

“This attitude and behaviour describe and represent us. Hopefully, we can follow the process from start to finish and return to our respective campuses again to follow the next learning process, bringing changes and goodness for all of us,” he added.

The exchange programme with UiTM is one of the international MBKM programmes. Director of USU's Directorate of Education Development Dr Muhammad Anggia Muchtar S.T., MM.IT. said the programme had been planned since last year but could only be realised in the spring semester of 2023.

Students who successfully qualify for this programme have met a series of requirements, one of which is academic achievement and great commitment. The Director of the USU Directorate of Education Development hopes that through this activity, students can have broad insights and bring something good to share when they return from completing this programme.

"For the first batch, students with good academic performance, and students who really want to participate in this programme because you can't do it half-heartedly, so you have to be fully committed, and it is hoped that from this, the 38 students will return with stories and share their experiences there," Anggia said.
