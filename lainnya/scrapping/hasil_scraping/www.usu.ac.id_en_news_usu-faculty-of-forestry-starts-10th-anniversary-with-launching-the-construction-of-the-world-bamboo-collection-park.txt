“Universities must certainly take steps in terms of educating the public to be environmentally sound, which can be realized by the USU Faculty of Forestry. So that people care more about the environment, which will have an impact on sustainability,” said Vice Rector II USU.

USU PR - One of the series of activities from the Anniversary of the Faculty of Forestry (Fahut) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), which took place on Wednesday, (16/10/2024), was the World Bamboo Collection Park Development Workshop as an opening. The successful launching was held at Campus 2 Kwala Bekala USU.

 

Representing the USU Rector, Dr. Muhammad Arifin Nasution S.Sos., M.SP., as Vice Rector II of USU, appreciated the achievements that have been made by Fahut USU, one of which is successfully achieving the 1st SINTA score in the USU environment. Therefore, the hope that Fahut USU will become a leader in efforts to conserve and preserve forests, as well as the wise use of forest resources for the welfare of the people and the integrity of forest areas in the future, is a point emphasized by Vice Rector II USU.

 

Fahut USU currently has 7 Science and Technology Excellence Centers, including the Mangrove Science and Technology Study Center, the JATI Sumatra Forestry Study Center, the Landscape Study Center, the Social Forestry Study and Development Center, the Center for Biodiversity and Environmental Studies, the Tropical Forest Management Study Center and the Bamboo Science and Technology Excellence Center. Thus, Arifin is optimistic that Fahut USU can maximize its role by exploring the resources and potential they have.

 

Not only is it a center of innovation, but Fahut is also expected to manage forest resources well, especially in the face of climate change and environmental sustainability. Of course, in supporting this, student involvement is needed to strengthen their practical experience.

 

“Universities must certainly take steps in terms of educating the public to be environmentally sound, which can be realized by the USU Faculty of Forestry. So that people care more about the environment, which will have an impact on sustainability,” said Vice Rector II USU.

 

Dean of Fahut USU, Dr. Rudi Hartono S.Hut., M.Si., mentioned that one of the strengths of the Faculty of Forestry is its vast location. This advantage encourages new potentials such as the launching of the World Bamboo Collection Park. The Dean hopes that the anniversary activities that will be carried out in the future can encourage alumni to establish collaboration and also agencies.

 

“Fahut USU this year will carry out international accreditation, we hope the results will be satisfactory, which will have an impact not only on Fahut but the Universitas Sumatera Utara,” added the Dean of Fahut USU.

 

The series of anniversary activities this time are very diverse. The Head of the 10th Anniversary of Fahut USU, Dr. Ridwanti Batubara S. Hut M. P., described starting from the procurement of sports competitions, Forest Got Talent, funwalks and many more with November 28, 2024 as the peak.

 

This year's theme aims to conserve and utilize bamboo, which will collect bamboo species around the world. Dr. Ir. Luthfi Hakim S. Hut. M. Si IPU ASEAN E.ng., as Secretary of PUI Bamboo USU, explained that the bamboo will be collected gradually, starting from Sumatran bamboo to bamboos in the world.
