“Eliminating the stigma of people with HIV is like a monster and can respect people affected by HIV / AIDS like ordinary people,” said Prof. Fidel.

USU PR - In commemoration of World HIV/AIDS Day, the Standing Committee on Reproductive Health Including AIDS (SCORA) of the Student Government (PEMA) of the Faculty of Medicine, University of North Sumatra (FK USU) organized a seminar and counseling on the importance of reproductive health. This activity took place at the FK USU Hall, on Sunday (01/12/2024).

 

This year, World HIV/AIDS Day took the theme “BRAVE: Breaking the Stigma, Raising Awareness, Valuing Everyone”. With this theme, people can understand that HIV is not just a matter of disease but also understanding, empathy and struggle against stigma. This activity is also in collaboration with Medan Plus Foundation.

 

Prof. Dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp.F.E.R, as the University Secretary, said that people need to eliminate stigma and discrimination that people with HIV (ODHIV) are not someone to be feared. People need to respect their existence as human beings.

 

“Eliminating the stigma of people with HIV is like a monster and can respect people affected by HIV / AIDS like ordinary people,” said Prof. Fidel.

 

Vice Dean I of FK USU, Dr. dr. Delyuzar M.Ked (PA), Sp.PA (K), also expressed his hope that people with HIV disease would no longer get a bad stigma. There needs to be psychological support by the family and community.

 

“There is no more discrimination because they are supported by family and society,” he hoped.

 

Muhammad Abrar Haidar Gunawan, as Chairman of Scora PEMA FK USU, said SCORA is an organization related to reproduction that has a moral responsibility to educate the public. This organization will continue to synergize and collaborate with stakeholders to continue to innovate.

 

“To continue to innovate and synergize with various parties and expand information related to accessing health,” he said.

 

Finally, Jasmine Khairunnisa Putri as the Chairperson of the Committee explained that this event also signed a campaign to the community in the framework of World HIV/AIDS Day. In addition, there are educational seminars that are expected to provide information about HIV/AIDS so that no more stigma develops.

 

“The general public is very ignorant about HIV/AIDS such as its spread, the myths circulating, and the stigma that exists in society that people with HIV are seen as bad,” she explained.
