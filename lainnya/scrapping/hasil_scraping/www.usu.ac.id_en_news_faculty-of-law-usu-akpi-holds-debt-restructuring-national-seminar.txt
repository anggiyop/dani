"The collaboration between AKPI and the Faculty of Law, or possibly with other faculties within USU, can not only be aimed at areas related to the implementation of the tridharma, but also possible for other fields," said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Faculty of Law (FH) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) in collaboration with the Indonesian Association of Curators and Administrators (AKPI) held a National Seminar "Debt Restructuring as a Solution to Save Business During the Covid-19 Pandemic" at Hotel Santika Premiere Dyandra Medan, Friday (11/19/2021).

In the event, a collaboration signing was also held between the Indonesian Association of Curators for Management (AKPI) and the USU Faculty of Law.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. said, the main profile of USU's FH graduates cannot be separated from the professions of Advocates, Curators and Administrators who are specifically concerned with legal issues.

"The collaboration between AKPI and the Faculty of Law, or possibly with other faculties within USU, can not only be aimed at areas related to the implementation of the Tridarma, but also possible for other fields," said the USU Rector.

He added, specifically for USU's Faculty of Law, this collaboration could be directed to support relevant MBKM programs, absorption of FH graduates, development of career information and job opportunities.

“Various programs that can be developed from this collaboration will greatly help USU, especially USU's Faculty of Law, in fulfilling various relevant Higher Education Key Performance Indicators (KPI). This collaboration is also for the benefit of AKPI as USU's cooperation partner," said the Rector.

The Rector also hopes that today's national seminar will become an event of academic thought and practice that is very important for society and the state.

On the same occasion, the General Chairperson of AKPI, Dr. Jimmy Simanjuntak, S.H, M.H said that AKPI has a mission that is useful for many people in Indonesia. One of the manifestations is this collaboration with USU.

"AKPI is very open if there are lecturers and students who have the will to do research or study bankruptcy law, AKPI will support the study," said Dr. Jimmy.

He added that AKPI also fully supports programs from USU and the government as a whole. "For the MBKM program, students who want to practice will also be supported by AKPI," he said. (©ULC)
