JARGON is a national competition to gain knowledge and implement the skills of the participants in the field of journalism. This activity is a forum for students to allocate talents in the field of journalism.

HUMAS USU - Pijar Student Press of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) successfully organized JARGON (Pijar Grant Competition), a national event aimed at enhancing participants' knowledge and practical skills in the field of journalism. The event took place at the Hall of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) on May 25, 2023.

JARGON serves as a platform for students to showcase their talents and allocate their skills in the field of journalism. It includes various competitions and workshops designed to promote learning and growth in journalism.

During the event, Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., MSP, the Dean of FISIP USU, expressed his support for Pijar student press in organizing events of international caliber. He emphasized the importance of appreciating the art of journalism and encouraged participants to enjoy the journalistic works presented during the event.

Dr. Hatta stated, "Starting next semester, we will be opening international classes, and it is our hope that future events will be held on an international scale. We believe this event can bring benefits not only to journalism but also to the realm of art, by enabling us to appreciate the results of journalism."

Usman Kansong S.Sos, M.Si, the Director General of Public Information and Communication at the Ministry of Communication and Information, served as a speaker and praised the event's impact in providing a broader perspective on utilizing and managing technology in journalism for campus press activists, teachers, and students.

He stated, "I believe today's event is excellent and holds significant importance. It offers a broader perspective to campus press activists, students, and teachers on the world of journalism. In the face of rapid technological advancements, this event provides valuable tips on how to effectively use technology to navigate the evolving landscape. I truly appreciate this event."

Dra. Mazdalifah, M.Si., Ph.D, the head of the USU Communication Science study program, expressed her positive response to the activities and expressed optimism in supporting national initiatives initiated by the Pijar student press and communication science students.

"As the head of the communication science study program, I extend my gratitude and strong support for activities like this. InshaAllah, there will be other national-scale activities initiated by Pijar and other students under the umbrella of the communication study program," said Dra. Mazdalifah.

Raymon Putra Pratama Silalahi, the Chief Executive of JARGON, extended his congratulations to the competition winners and offered words of encouragement to all participants. He emphasized that even for those who did not emerge victorious, the experience should serve as a source of motivation, as defeat does not signify the end of their journey.

He stated, "Congratulations to all the participants who took part in the competition and emerged as winners. For those who didn't succeed this time, I encourage you to remain enthusiastic because setbacks are not the end. I hope that this activity will continue in the future, and pijar student press will consistently organize new and exciting events."

Raymon's message aimed to inspire participants to persevere in their journalistic endeavors and look forward to future opportunities for growth and participation
