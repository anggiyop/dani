We hope that this will be an open gate for USU and Pelindo to develop better, more contributive cooperation in the future. Today the MoU will be symbolized by planting 4.000 trees at Universitas Sumatera Utara.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) established a collaboration with PT Pelabuhan Indonesia (Pelindo) (Persero) which was marked by a Tree Planting Social Action.

This tree planting itself was carried out in the USU Parking Lot, on Saturday (16/09/2023).

PT Pelindo itself implemented a program to plant 20.000 trees simultaneously throughout Indonesia.

While at USU, about 4.000 trees have been prepared to be planted. This planting action coincides with the momentum of World Ozone Day. The ozone layer serves to protect the earth from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays, with the implementation of this tree planting, it can help preserve nature.

USU Vice Rector I Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, said that this activity could bring further cooperation by the Tri Dharma of Higher Education.

"We hope that this will be an open gate for USU and Pelindo to develop better, more contributive cooperation in the future. Today the MoU will be symbolized by planting 4.000 trees at Universitas Sumatera Utara," said VR I.

WR I also said that this tree planting activity is expected to symbolize the cooperation between USU and PT Pelindo which continues to grow and develop like a tree.

"This tree planting is a symbol of sustainability, yes. Sustainability of civilization, sustainability of life. So we hope that the cooperation that we carry out today with PT Pelabuhan Indonesia can continue to develop like a growing tree that will provide life to all living things, "he added.

Regional Head of PT Pelabuhan Indonesia (Persero) Yarham Harid said that this planting was a form of concern and responsibility for the environment, especially around USU.

"Yes, of course in line with what the Vice Rector said earlier, we hope that outside if it is clear, this tree planting program is clearly our form of concern for the environment. But behind that, we actually have very high hopes for the cooperation that we have carried out. Joint planting between Pelindo and USU. It can benefit us in particular, and for all Indonesian people," Yarham explained.
