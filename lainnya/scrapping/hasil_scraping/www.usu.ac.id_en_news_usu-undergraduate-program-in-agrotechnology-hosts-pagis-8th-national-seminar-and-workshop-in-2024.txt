“Higher education plays a crucial role in shaping a competent, innovative, and globally competitive young generation. Therefore, quality assurance in study programs is essential to ensure that our curricula are relevant and address contemporary challenges,” Prof. Muryanto said in his address.

 

Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), through its Faculty of Agriculture Undergraduate Program in Agrotechnology, served as the host for the 8th National Seminar and Workshop of the Indonesian Agro-Technology/Agro-Ecotechnology Association (PAGI) in 2024. The event took place at the Digital Learning Centre Building (DLCB) USU, on Friday, July 26, 2024.

The seminar and workshop were attended by 90 participants from 30 universities across Indonesia and focused on the theme "Quality Assurance Systems in Study Programs Toward Global Competitiveness: Relevance of Agro-Technology/Agro-Ecotechnology Curricula." Speakers included Prof. Dr. Sri Suning Kusumawardani, S.T., M.T., Director General of Belmawa; Prof. Dr. Hadiwiyono, M.Si, Secretary General of PAGI and Chair of the Accreditation Instrument Preparation Team; Dr. Lis Noer Aini, S.P., M.Si, Head of Learning and Student Affairs; Dr. Penta Suryaminarsih, M.P., Head of the Agro-Technology Master’s Program at UPN Veteran East Java; and Dr. Tri Mujoko, M.P., Chair of the Publication and Communication Division. Also in attendance were PAGI Chair Dr. Sandra Pakasi, M.Si, deans of agricultural faculties, and heads of Agro-Technology undergraduate and master’s programs from various institutions. The event concluded on July 27, 2024, with a field trip to the Berastagi region in North Sumatra.

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, praised the seminar and workshop in a speech read by the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, Prof. Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana, M.S. He commended the event as a valuable opportunity to foster knowledge sharing and current information in agro-technology. USU is committed to supporting the recommendations produced by the seminar and workshop.

“Higher education plays a crucial role in shaping a competent, innovative, and globally competitive young generation. Therefore, quality assurance in study programs is essential to ensure that our curricula are relevant and address contemporary challenges,” Prof. Muryanto said in his address.

He added that, in the context of agro-technology, curriculum relevance must encompass various aspects, including the latest agricultural technologies, environmental sustainability, and innovations in agro-technical practices. A well-designed curriculum will not only enhance graduate competencies but also positively contribute to the sustainable development of the agricultural sector.

In another address, Prof. Dr. Hadiwiyono, M.Si, Secretary General of PAGI and Chair of the Accreditation Instrument Preparation Team, thanked the Agro-Technology Program and Faculty of Agriculture at USU for facilitating the 8th PAGI Seminar and Workshop. He noted that the event aimed to formulate learning outcomes for both undergraduate and master’s agro-technology programs, aligning them with government policies outlined in Permendikbudristek No. 53 of 2023.

Dr. Nini Rahmawati, S.P., M.Si, Chair of the PAGI Seminar and Workshop Committee and Head of USU’s Agro-Technology Program, stated that the seminar was organized to address rapid developments in the agricultural sector driven by advances in science and technology. These developments cover various aspects of agriculture, including crop cultivation, livestock, and agricultural product processing.

“In this era of globalization, agro-technology must produce graduates who are competent, competitive, and capable of addressing challenges in the agricultural world. Achieving this goal requires an effective and efficient quality assurance system, which was discussed during the seminar,” Dr. Nini said.

The 2024 PAGI Seminar and Workshop collaborated with the 8th International Conference on Agriculture, Environment, and Food Security (ICAEFS), held at the same venue on July 25, 2024. (RJ)
