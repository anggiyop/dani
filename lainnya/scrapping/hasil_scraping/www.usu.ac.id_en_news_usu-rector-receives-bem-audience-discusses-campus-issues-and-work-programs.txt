“We will follow up again with USU students so that all students know what results we have consolidated,” said the Chairman of BEM.

 

Public Relations USU - The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., received an audience from the Student Executive Board (BEM) in the framework of new management, including the chairman and vice chairman of BEM and members. In this audience, they discussed various current issues and work programs that will be carried out in the future. This audience was held in the USU Rector's Audience Room, on Monday (03/03/2025).

 

In this discussion, the USU rector conveyed several important things: internal suggestions for BEM membership, asset use, issues related to UKT, UKM Center, and various other matters. He also emphasized transparency and collaboration between students and universities. One of these collaborations is the BEM work program, which is adjusted to the tri dharma of higher education.

 

Furthermore, the USU Rector said that the Single Tuition Fee (UKT) would not increase. He emphasized that policies regarding UKT will be carefully considered to maintain affordable access to education for students. The university seeks to improve the quality of academic services and campus facilities without burdening students. In addition, UKT will be considered based on students' financial capacity.

 

“Don't worry about the increase in UKT. There are ways and procedures,” explained the Rector.

 

This hearing also highlighted the use of assets in the campus environment. In the future, there will be a standard procedure for disciplining students who borrow rooms and equipment. This standardized procedure for borrowing assets will maintain the use of equipment.

 

The Chairman of BEM USU, Muzammil Ihsan, ensured that all students knew the results consolidated with the Rector. One of them concerns budget efficiency, which impacts the increase in UKT, which is not happening at USU.

 

“We will follow up again with USU students so that all students know what results we have consolidated,” said the Chairman of BEM.
