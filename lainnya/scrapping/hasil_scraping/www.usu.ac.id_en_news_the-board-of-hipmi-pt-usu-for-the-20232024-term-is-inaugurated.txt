"There is an effort based on products and innovation. If I have to answer which one to merge, in my opinion, it would be innovation because deindustrialization is happening in this era of disruption, which will result in the highest unemployment rate," explained the Dean of FISIP.

USU PR — The Indonesian Young Entrepreneurs Association in Higher Education (HIPMI PT) at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the inauguration of the board for the 2023-2024 term at the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall of the Faculty of Economics and Business, on Saturday (Mar. 23). The inauguration was conducted by the Chairman of HIPMI PT North Sumatra, M. Rizqi Sukarno.

In his speech, the Dean of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP), Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., MSP, expressed that innovation is crucial in any business, as there is currently a significant deindustrialization that results in unemployment. He also mentioned that USU provides facilities and infrastructure for innovation through the Entrepreneur Center in collaboration with the Medan City Government.

"There is an effort based on products and innovation. If I have to answer which one to merge, in my opinion, it would be innovation because deindustrialization is happening in this era of disruption, which will result in the highest unemployment rate," explained the Dean of FISIP.

The Chairman of HIPMI PT North Sumatra stated that the focus of HIPMI is to have a significant positive impact on the campus and to serve as an incubator for students who aspire to become entrepreneurs.

"The entrepreneurial spirit of HIPMI PT USU members should be further enhanced so as not to hurt the campus," said M. Rizqi.

The HIPMI PT USU Inauguration Committee Chairman, Arif Adriansyah, stated that 77 students from various majors will be inaugurated this time. Arif also mentioned that HIPMI PT USU is committed to being a driving force for all associations and supporting SMEs who want to participate in USU activities, especially in entrepreneurship.

This aligns with the statement made by the newly inaugurated Chairman of HIPMI PT USU, Mufti Ramadan, that HIPMI PT USU aspires to develop programs that represent the three pillars of higher education.

"We, HIPMI PT USU, aspire to develop programs that represent the three pillars of higher education," said Mufti.
