The program will focus on sustainable tourism, and international students will participate from countries such as Germany, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia. Students from other Western Region State Universities will also participate.

USU PR — To enhance the quality of graduates and expand international networks, the Western Region State Universities Cooperation Agency (BKS PTN Barat) is organizing an International Community Service Program (KKN). A total of 192 students, including 150 from various state universities in the western region, 14 from Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), and 28 international students, will participate in this community service program for 10 weeks. The program's opening ceremony was held on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, at the Digital Learning Centre Building (DLCB) of USU.

 

The program will focus on sustainable tourism, and international students will participate from countries such as Germany, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia. Students from other Western Region State Universities will also participate.

 

The KKN International program will be conducted in 10 villages in the Karo and Samosir regencies, areas rich in tourism potential. For the first six weeks, students will undergo online training through USU’s smart platform. They will then spend four weeks working directly with the community to implement the planned work programs.

 

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., stated that the KKN International program is designed to produce graduates who not only possess high academic competence but also have strong social awareness and adaptability. He explained that this program aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), emphasizing human development, socio-economic growth, and environmental sustainability.

 

"This International KKN program is designed to produce graduates with high academic competence and strong social awareness and adaptability," the USU Rector emphasized.

 

Dr. Rusdi Noor Rosa, the coordinator of the 2024 BKS PTN Barat International KKN program, explained that the theme of sustainable tourism was chosen in response to the tourism sector's struggles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He encouraged the participating students to contribute to the recovery of the local tourism sector in a sustainable manner.

 

This International KKN program is expected to offer dual benefits for students and the community. For students, it provides an opportunity to apply their knowledge, develop soft skills, and expand their international networks. For the community, the program is expected to offer solutions to local challenges, particularly in the field of tourism.

 

"The theme of sustainable tourism was chosen in response to the tourism sector's struggles due to the COVID-19 pandemic," Dr. Rusdi explained.
