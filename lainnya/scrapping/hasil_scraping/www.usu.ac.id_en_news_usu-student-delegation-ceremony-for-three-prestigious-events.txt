Vice Rector I of USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., added that participation in these three events is not only to compete but also to bring the good name of the alma mater to the national and international arena. These three events are an opportunity to showcase ability, creativity, and sportsmanship in academics, arts, and sports.

 

“Your hard work and dedication will not be in vain. We pray that the best results can be achieved by our delegates,” said Dr. Edy.

 

Director of USU's Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, Rahma Yurliani S.Psi, M.Psi, as well as the Head of Delegation, said that 50 USU delegates will participate in the “23rd IMT-GT Varsity Carnival” which will be held at University Sains Malaysia, on August 25-31, 2024.

Rahma Yurliani S.Psi, M.Psi, also continued that 17 USU delegates will participate in “Peksiminas XVII,” which will take place at Universitas Negeri Jakarta, on September 1-7, 2024. For “PON XXI 2024”, 30 USU delegates will participate in the event held in Aceh-North Sumatra on September 8-20, 2024.
