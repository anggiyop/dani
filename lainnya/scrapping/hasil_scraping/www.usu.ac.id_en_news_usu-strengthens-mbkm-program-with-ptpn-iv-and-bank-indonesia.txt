“These evaluations are needed so that the quality of the MBKM program will be better in the future. The MBKM program is also the main target for the achievement of the USU Rector and it is hoped that 30 percent of the total USU students can carry out the MBKM program with partners," said Vice Rector I, Dr Edy Ikhsan, MA.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) strengthened the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program with PTPN IV and Bank Indonesia, Thursday (10/21/2021). Previously, the MBKM program at the two USU partners had been running, but encountered several obstacles.

Deputy Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan emphasized that some of the problems faced include the problem of recognizing the courses that will be carried out in the study program. In its early application, the study program had some difficulty in recognizing the courses that would be converted into credits.

“These technical matters must be resolved so that the MBKM program can be in line with the curriculum at the university. Next is the matter of the schedule which must also be synchronized with the lecture schedule of the accompanying lecturers. So from the start, these students must be accompanied, and we will improve this more," he said.

Another thing, added Dr. Edy, is how to respond to students who leave in the middle of the road. USU will make a policy so that students do not back down while carrying out a certified internship. This problem has occurred and has greatly affected various aspects, ranging from the learning climate to the breakdown of the apprenticeship system that has been designed in such a way.

“These evaluations are needed so that the quality of the MBKM program will be better in the future. The MBKM program is also the main target for the achievement of the USU Rector and it is hoped that 30 percent of the total USU students can carry out the MBKM program with partners," he said.

Edy Ikhsan also thanked PTPN IV and Bank Indonesia for giving USU students the opportunity to do internships and gain experience. "I hope that USU students who pass the MBKM program at PTPN IV and Bank Indonesia can become role models, there are success stories from successful students that inspire other students to participate in the MBKM program," he said.

The strengthening of the MBKM program with partners from Bank Indonesia and PTPN IV was also attended by the Chair of the Study Program at USU whose students were involved in the MBKM program and attended by Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Z Hasibuan and representatives of partners. (©ULC)
