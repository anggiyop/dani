USU PUBLIC RELATIONS-MEDAN: 15 Students from the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) successfully passed the selection conducted by PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero Tbk and USU in the recruitment of candidates for the Independent Special Region Leaders (CPDK). The CPDK selection is a collaboration between the two institutions and a combination of the implementation of the Independent Learning Campus (MBKM) policy with the regional leadership recruitment system carried out by PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.

Angga Erlangga Hanafie as Regional CBP of Bank Mandiri Region I/Sumatra I stated this in the momentum for the signing of the MoU between USU and PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk which took place on Tuesday (8/24/20210), online.

“The CPDK selection was attended by 212 USU students and the best is 15 participants left from all the selection stages. However, only 12 participants confirmed in the final,” Erlangga added.

Furthermore, students who pass will enter the first phase of the internship class with an introduction to all banking work materials for 3 months.

Followed by phase II where students have started doing work like other employees of PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk and lasts for 6 months. If they pass this stage, then the next process for these students will be officially contracted by Bank Mandiri and it is possible to occupy positions as leaders of Bank Mandiri.

The USU Rector welcomed the results of the CPDK selection, which started USU’s collaboration with PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk in the Merdeka Learning corridor at the Merdeka Cmpus.

“The selection made by Bank Mandiri is extraordinary. Thus we can make rails or guides for students, but do not force students to take them for granted. We only provide guidance on the nest path they can take for their future,” the USU Rector said.

The Rector hopes that USU can produce graduates who are in accordance with the competencies and needs that exist in the industrial world. (RJ/©ULC)
