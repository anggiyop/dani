"USU is located in the Medan city area of the main campus, so we cannot be separated from the Medan City RKPD in infrastructure development on this main campus. USU and the Medan City Government will always work together in a symbiotic mutualism," said Prof. Fidel.

USU PR - Secretary USU Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K) representing the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) at the invitation of the mayor of Medan in the Development Planning Consultation (MUSRENBANG) RKPD Medan City Year 2023. The event took place at the Hotel Santika Dyandra on Wednesday (3/23/2022).

Prof. Fidel said, given the location of USU's main campus in Medan City, this made USU inseparable from the Medan City regional development plan in infrastructure development in USU's main campus. This is as conveyed by Prof. Fidel that USU will cooperate with the government in relation to the RKPD.

The Regional Development Work Plan (RKPD) is a document outlining the medium-term development plan for a region, including the City of Medan. The document contains contents that become material for performance appraisal or evaluation, both for basic level services and infrastructure services.

"USU is located in the Medan city area of ​​the main campus, so we cannot be separated from the Medan City RKPD in infrastructure development on this main campus. USU and the Medan City Government will always work together in a symbiotic mutualism," he said.

The USU secretary also reaffirmed the mayor's message reminding that everything can work well. Although the message was emphasized to the Medan City Government, it was inseparable from the performance of the USU academic community because it was in the working area of ​​Medan City.

"Thank you for being invited. In his speech, the mayor reminded us all to work well. Indeed, he emphasized the government and regional apparatus, but it cannot be separated from the performance of the academic community because, as I said, we are in the working area of ​​Medan City, "he explained.

By holding this event, Prof. Fidel hopes that USU will always synergize with the Medan City Government, because later the developments carried out by USU will intersect with the infrastructure built by the Medan City government. (©ULC)
