"There are many small preparations that we have to fix. And through this kind of competition on campus, we can encourage USU's preparation for the UI Green Metric assessment. I hope that in the future the USU UI Green Metric Team can focus on various programs to achieve this," said the USU Rector.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., appreciated the winners at the 2021 USU Green Campus and Poster Competition. On that occasion, the Rector handed over prizes to the winners at the Rector's Office, Saturday (10/23/2021).

"We have a lot of small preparations that we have to fix. And through this kind of competition on campus, we can encourage USU's preparation for the UI Green Metric assessment. I hope that in the future the USU UI Green Metric Team can focus on various programs to achieve this," said the USU Rector.

He motivated all USU leaders, faculties, and units to encourage the creation of a "Green Campus" environment starting from the area they lead. The participation of all parties is very decisive in USU's efforts to improve achievements in the UI Green Metric.

"We must work together so that USU's ranking in the UI Green Metric assessment can increase. Previously it was in position 14, then it rose to 11, so next year we are targeting to be in the top 10," Mury said.

Muryanto Amin also mentioned that he is currently trying to communicate with several potential partners to support USU's plan. Collaboration with various parties helps USU achieve its goals and targets.

"We have communicated with several potential partners. One of the things we hope for is the use of a Solar Power Plant. With this plant, it is expected to reduce USU electricity load," he said.

Accompanied by Vice Rector IV Prof. Drs. Opim Salim Sitompul, MSc, the USU Rector presented prizes in the faculty category, USU Faculty of Engineering won first place, followed by USU Faculty of Public Health and USU Faculty of Medicine in second and third places.

Prof Opim said this effort must be continuous. "Because I basically hope that the term "Green Campus" will appear naturally. It means that we are trying and intending to become a Green Campus because USU is indeed implementing it," Prof. Opim explained.

The first place was won by the USU Integrated Laboratory UPT in the unit category. The second place went to the USU Hospital and the third place went to the USU Information System Center. The competition also competed for the best poster with the theme "USU Big Idea on Green Innovation."

The first winner was a USU Psychology Faculty student with the poster title of Reduce Plastic. The second place winner was won by a USU Faculty of Engineering student with the poster title of Paving Blocks Made from Plastic Waste. The third winner was won by a USU Faculty of Law student with the poster title of Vending Machine Selling Edible Tableware Paid for with Plastic Waste. This title is also a favorite winner on social media.

The activity which was held after the morning run was also attended by the Secretary of the University, Educational Staff of the Information Systems, Planning and Development Bureau of USU, as well as several lecturers at USU. (©ULC)
