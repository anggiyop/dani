“I think this activity is very interesting for USU students considering that the speakers who come are practitioners because they can learn directly with people who are in the industrial world and how its dynamics, explained the Dean of FH USU”

USU PR - The Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas Business Activities (SKK MIGAS) held a public lecture SKK Migas-KKKS Goes to Campus to the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), which took place on Thursday, (12/09/2024) at the Hall of the Faculty of Law USU.

In order to create synergy between the world of education and the energy industry, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., Apt as Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service and USU Cooperation, appreciated this activity because it could improve the quality and competence of graduates by making a real contribution to the development of Indonesian human resources.

Between the world of academia and industry, collaboration is needed because it plays a major role in the economic development of a country while facing various challenges to support sustainability so it is very important for students to understand the dynamics that occur in the industrial sector, especially the oil and gas industry.

Prof. Poppy hopes that this activity can open a window of insight for students who are agents of change in order to utilize all the potential that exists to improve the quality of human resources.

This socialization is considered very relevant to the campus according to the Dean of FH USU, Dr. Mahmul Siregar S.H., M.Hum., because it can arouse the enthusiasm of students to learn more about the industrial world. Not only that, but it is also closely related to one of the rector's priority programs, namely developing the Teaching Industry.

“I think this activity is very interesting for USU students considering that the speakers who come are practitioners because they can learn directly with people who are in the industrial world and how its dynamics,” continued the Dean of FH USU.

Head of Program and Communication Division of SKK Migas, Hudi D. Suryodipuro, explained the possibility of internship opportunities at SKK Migas - K3S will be widely open to USU students. The material provided is also tailored to the faculty so that students get an overview of work in the oil and gas industry in accordance with their domain.

“Our main goal is to provide socialization and education related to the oil and gas industry because there are still many people who do not know the impact it has on society and the state,” added Hudi.
