“We hope this conference will produce policy recommendations and technological innovations that will be implemented in various countries,” Vice Rector I said.

 

USU PR—The 8th International Conference on Agricultural, Environment, and Food Security (AEFS) 2024, themed “Eco-Friendly Agriculture to Increase Food System Resilience,” was hosted once again by the Faculty of Agriculture at Universitas Sumatera Utara (FP USU). The event took place in a hybrid format, held at the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB) USU and via Zoom Conference on Thursday, July 25, 2024.

 

Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., representing the Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., expressed his appreciation for the event, emphasizing USU's commitment to supporting all scientific activities.

 

“USU is always committed to supporting all scientific activities,” he said.

 

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., explained that AEFS is a leading international conference that has been held regularly since 2017. He hoped the conference would yield policy recommendations and technological innovations that could be implemented in various countries.

 

“We hope this conference will produce policy recommendations and technological innovations that will be implemented in various countries,” he said.

 

The Dean of FP USU, Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana, M.S., noted that nine countries, including Malaysia, Australia, Russia, and 49 universities, participated in this year's AEFS. She explained that the conference, held since 2017, would result in proceedings published by IOP and indexed in Scopus.

 

“The proceedings will be published in IOP and indexed in Scopus,” she explained.

 

Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana, M.S., also mentioned that AEFS was held in conjunction with the Indonesian Association of Agro-Technology/Agro-Eco-Technology (PAGI) activities. PAGI participants, who disseminated their research findings at AEFS today, will continue with their National Seminar and Workshop (SEMILOKNAS) on Friday, July 26, 2024.

 

“PAGI participants are gathered here to disseminate their research findings at AEFS, and tomorrow they will have their association meeting,” she said.

 

Prof. Dr. Ir. Elisa Julianti, M.Si., Chair of the 8th AEFS 2024 and Vice Dean III of FP USU, stated that the event was attended by participants from various fields, including agro-technology, food technology, plant science, environmental science, and animal science. Participants from engineering, agriculture, economics, and other disciplines within agriculture, environment, and food security also attended the conference.

She said, “Everyone can participate as long as they meet the scope of agriculture, environment, and food security.”

 

Prof. Dr. Ir. Elisa Julianti, M.Si., hopes that hosting AEFS at USU will enhance the university's international reputation, given the significant involvement of international researchers. She sees this as a bridge to increase USU's global recognition.
