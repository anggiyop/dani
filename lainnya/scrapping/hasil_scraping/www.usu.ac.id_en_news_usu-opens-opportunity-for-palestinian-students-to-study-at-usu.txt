USU PR – In a significant step towards fostering international ties, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has initiated discussions with the Palestinian Ambassador to Indonesia, H.E.

"We warmly welcome this visit as a form of support for Palestine," stated Prof. Himsar. Further details on the admission process for Palestinian students will be outlined by a dedicated team. The team will plan specific courses based on the needs and interests of Palestinian students, with discussions on quotas as part of the ongoing collaboration.
