He also said that WALHI is expected to be more mature in cooperating with campuses in formulating a policy agenda. In the end, scientific principles will be combined with empirical experience from WALHI so that they can form a mature concept and become the right policy recommendation for North Sumatra.

"We hope that WALHI in the field is more mature in collaborating with campuses to formulate a policy agenda that we can convey to decision makers about our concerns. can form a mature concept into what policy recommendations are right for North Sumatra,” said Dr. Hatta.

Ultimately, Dr. Hatta appealed to the younger generation to care about the need for a healthy environment and support future performance. The younger generation is expected to be useful not only for themselves but also for the community.

“The young generation must care for their future, not the future, not only related to economic interests, family life, but also our need for a healthy environment and support our performance in life so that we can be useful for society. Come on, the young generation, let's be aware of the environment," he said.
