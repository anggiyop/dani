The Rector of USU said that this activity discussed the continued cooperation program between USU and the government regarding infrastructure development in the North Sumatra region.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., MSi attended the Capacity Building event related to the Government and Business Entity Cooperation Scheme (KPBU), which was held at the Adimulia Hotel on Thursday, (23/06/2022).

The Rector said that this activity was a discussion on the continued cooperation program between USU and the government regarding infrastructure development in the North Sumatra region.

Later, a mentoring team will coordinate with Bapennas, the Ministry of Finance, and related institutions.

"The discussion also provides an understanding of the PPP project. It is a collaboration between the government and business entities in the context of accelerating infrastructure development," said the Rector.

The Rector hopes that everyone who attends this activity gets information and a good understanding of the direction and purpose of the capacity building so that the information can be put to good use.

"I hope that, through this activity and from the competent sources present today, we will all get complete information and a good understanding regarding the direction and purpose of the capacity building we are doing," he said.

SVP of Business Initiation of PT PII Sharing Session of KPBU Project Sei Mangkei Nandang Prihantoro said, through this event the Ministry of Finance and Bapennas aimed to encourage the education sector, especially universities, to develop PPP schemes.

"Nationally, the government, through the Ministry of Finance and Bapennas, encourages the education sector, especially universities, to develop PPP schemes to develop services to students," he explained.

Nandang Prihantoro added that the infrastructure services that will be prepared at the KPBU do not wait for APBN funds because they are working with the private sector.

"What the PPP is basically about is that we don't wait for the state budget money to be available, but in collaboration with the private sector to prepare infrastructure services, students can practice better and get more definite teaching materials," he said.

He hopes that Bapennas will immediately receive a proposal from USU, so that it can prepare facilities.
