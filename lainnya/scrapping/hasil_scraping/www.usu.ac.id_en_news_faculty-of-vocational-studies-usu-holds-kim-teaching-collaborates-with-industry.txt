“This seminar is a real step to bring together students with experienced industry practitioners,” said Vice Dean III FV USU.

USU PR - The Faculty of Vocational Studies (FV) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) successfully held a “KIM Mengajar” event as part of the 2nd Anniversary series. The event aimed to broaden students' knowledge of the industrial world by inviting the President Director of PT Kawasan Industri Medan (KIM), Daly Maulana, as a speaker. It took place in the FV USU Hall on Thursday (19/09/24).

 

In his speech, Vice Dean III of the Faculty of Vocational Studies, Drs. Gustanto, M.Hum., representing the Dean of FV USU, Prof. Dr. Isfenti Sadalia, S.E., M.E., emphasized the importance of collaboration between the world of education, especially vocational studies and industry. According to him, this seminar is a real step in bringing together students with experienced industry practitioners. He also said that Daly Maulana's long experience in managing industrial estates would be a valuable provision for students to understand the dynamics of the world of work.

 

“This seminar is a real step to bring together students with experienced industrial practitioners,” said Vice Dean III FV USU.

 

Meanwhile, Daly Maulana in his presentation conveyed the importance of the role of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in bridging the gap between the world of education and industry. He emphasized that programs such as certified internships and magenta are great opportunities for students to develop themselves. He also encouraged students to be active in organizations and networking to improve their soft and hard skills.

 

“Programs such as certified internships and magenta are great opportunities for students to develop themselves,” said Daly.

 

The cooperation between the USU Faculty of Vocational Studies and PT KIM has been established through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), and in the future a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), and Implementing Agreement (IA) will be established. With this cooperation, it is hoped that students of the Faculty of Vocational Studies can get more and better quality field work opportunities.
