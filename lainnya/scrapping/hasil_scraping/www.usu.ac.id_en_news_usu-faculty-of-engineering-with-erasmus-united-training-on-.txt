"This project aims to improve student competence in the automotive engineering field," said Dr. Tulus.

PR USU - Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) in collaboration with the Erasmus+ UNITED Training Project held training on Introduction, Operational Systems, Energy Management, and Troubleshooting on Hybrid Engines. This activity was held at the Mechanical Engineering Masters Building, Faculty of Engineering (FT) USU on Thursday (21/04/2022).

One of the speakers who was the Secretary of Doctoral Degree in FT USU Dr. Tulus B. Sitorus, ST., MT said that this activity was aimed at increasing capacity by implementing expert training for academic staff, students and related companies.

"This project aims to improve student competence in the automotive engineering field," said Dr. Tulus.

In addition, this activity is also a form of fostering university and business cooperation through the installation of technical knowledge transfer units and the UNITED network which will lead to an increase in knowledge, as well as higher teaching standards and graduate employability.

"There were several sub-materials presented, namely Introduction to Hybrid Engines, Characteristics, Operations, and Performance of Hybrid Engines, Identification of Operations and System Components of Series-Parallel Hybrid Vehicles, Energy Management of Hybrid Engine Vehicles, and Troubleshooting on Hybrid Engines," said Dr, Tulus.

Dr. Tulus also hopes that all laboratories at USU will have the appropriate equipment according to their capacities after the event. In addition, it is also necessary to carry out adequate maintenance.

"Earlier, an introduction to the hybrid system was made, coincidentally the simulator is in Mechanical Engineering. We hope that USU students can understand this, and that the laboratories at USU can have this tool," he said.
