According to Martha, there are several advantages of this product, namely it is formulated with food grade ingredients, dries quickly, not sticky and remains soft on hands.

USU PR - UPT Integrated Research Laboratory, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has succeeded in creating a Hada Hand Sanitizer product that functions to clean hands thoroughly without water and soap.

At the demonstration activity for the manufacture of Hada Hand Sanitizer, Friday (12/17/2021), UPT Integrated Lab laboratory assistant Martha Martinni, S.Si., said, the manufacture of this hand sanitizer product refers to the manufacturing process recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, only a soft scented essential oil is added to make it comfortable to use.

"This product is the same as the product on the outside, referring to the WHO manufacturing process with 96% ethanol content, 3% H2O2, and 98% glycerin as recommended, only adding essential oils," said Martha. There are no side effects from using this product, she said

"After being used, the effects are like products on the market, there are no side effects," she said.

According to Martha, there are several advantages of this product, namely it is formulated with food grade ingredients, dries quickly, not sticky and remains soft in the hands.

Since it was successfully made in early December, currently the use of Hada Hand Sanitizer is only for a limited number of people within USU.

"Currently, Hada is only for a limited number of people, especially for the ranks and laboratory staff at the Integrated Lab UPT, not yet for sale," she said.

Martha hopes that further clinical testing of Hada Hand Sanitizer can be carried out so that it can be marketed.

"Hopefully this can be brought out, marketed by being tested more specifically whether it meets the requirements to be sold in the market," she concluded.(©ULC)
