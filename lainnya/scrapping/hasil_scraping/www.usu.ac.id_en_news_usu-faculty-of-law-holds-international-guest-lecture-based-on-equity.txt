“This is an activity related to the EQUITY program by FH. Previously, we were with external lecturers from Jindal Global University adjunct professor, Chuo University guest lecture, then this guest lecture from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,” said Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum.

USU PR—The Doctoral and Master of Law Studies Program of the Faculty of Law (FH), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an International Guest Lecture, presenting Dr. Prosper Simbarashe Maguchu, LL.M from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam which was held for two days. The activity was opened with a Public Lecture entitled “Sharing Experience Managing University Journal” which took place in the Faculty Advisory Board Room (DPF) of FH USU, on Thursday-Wednesday (02/22-23/2024).

Related to this, FH USU held an audience with university leaders who were received by USU Vice Rector IV Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., accompanied by the Director of the USU Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., M.T. at the Rector's Audience Room, USU Central Administration Bureau Building.

The next day, the series of events continued by holding a Public Lecture, entitled “General Lecturer: Past Corruption and Human Rights”. The activity was divided into two sessions, the first session involving master students and the second session involving doctoral students.

This activity is a follow-up to the USU Faculty of Law's visit to Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam last October. Therefore, the Dean of FH USU Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum. said that the hearing was a report to the university leadership regarding the activities carried out by the Faculty. So there are several academic activities while the guest lecturer is at FH, which involves journal managers and FH USU S2 and S3 students.

“This is an activity related to the EQUITY program by FH. Previously, we were with external lecturers from Jindal Global University adjunct professor, Chuo University guest lecture, then this guest lecture from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,” said Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum.

Chairperson of the USU Faculty of Law S3 Study Program, Prof. Dr. Ningrum Natasya Sirait, S.H., MLI revealed that this program is part of the EQUITY program which has strong support from the university. Prof. Dr. Ningrum Natasya Sirait, S.H., MLI said, through hearings with the rectorate there were many potentials and opportunities for wider development.

“It turns out that after being developed there are many possibilities that can be expanded. He has been to UI and UNHAS as an adjunct professor. We want to offer, it seems more appropriate that there are foreign professors willing to live here to join our lecture scheme, “said Prof. Dr. Ningrum Natasya Sirait, S.H., MLI.

Prof. Dr. Ningrum Natasya Sirait, S.H., MLI also explained the background of the theme selection on the second day of the public lecture, which is inseparable from the urgency of exploring a deep understanding of the complexity of the growing global legal challenges. Because corruption is often the root of human rights violations.

“Regarding today's theme, we raise this issue because corruption impacts human rights. This is very important for students to understand and learn,” explained Prof. Ningrum.

Dr. Prosper Simbarashe Maguchu, LL.M. emphasized that the fight against corruption is very inclusive. Students have a big role to play in the fight against corruption by contributing through writing articles, criticizing, or evaluating the laws in Indonesia. Dr. Prosper Simbarashe Maguchu, LL.M. hopes that the results of this discussion can help universities manage journals efficiently and improve their visibility, ranking, and quality.

“In addition, students can help popularize laws that can fight corruption. Thus, students have a special role to play in the fight against corruption,” said Dr. Prosper.
