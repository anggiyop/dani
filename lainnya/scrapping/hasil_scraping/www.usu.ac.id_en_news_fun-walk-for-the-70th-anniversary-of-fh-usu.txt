"The Faculty of Law has consistently excelled in producing outstanding legal professionals and defenders of justice, spread across various regions of Indonesia," stated Prof. Fidel.

USU PR—The Faculty of Law (FH) at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Fun Walk event titled "Together in Synergy and Collaboration" as part of the 70th Anniversary celebrations on Saturday, March 2, 2024, at the FH USU courtyard.

University Secretary, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K)-Fer, representing USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., emphasized that the Faculty of Law has consistently proven itself in producing exceptional legal professionals and upholders of justice. This, he said, is a significant asset for USU in achieving its goal of becoming an internationally recognized university.

"The Faculty of Law has consistently excelled in producing outstanding legal professionals and defenders of justice, spread across various regions of Indonesia," stated Prof. Fidel.

Furthermore, the University Secretary expressed the rectorate's appreciation for FH’s achievements to date, particularly in earning top accreditation for the undergraduate and graduate programs, B accreditation for the Master of Notary program, and very good accreditation for the doctoral program.

"We also hope the Faculty of Law will continue to enhance its international accomplishments in support of USU," added Prof. Fidel.

Dean of the Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum., expressed gratitude to the founders of the Faculty of Law who successfully realized their noble dream of building an institution that produces graduates capable of transforming the nation.

"Initially, it might have been just discussions, but 70 years later, they have achieved something extraordinary that has changed the nation," said the Dean of FH.

He further urged the entire academic community to earnestly continue the work of their predecessors to build the Faculty of Law USU for future generations.

"Let’s work together to build the Faculty of Law USU, perhaps not for ourselves anymore, but for our children and grandchildren," the Dean added.

In a separate statement, the Chairman of the Alumni Association (IKA) FH USU, Hasrul Benny Harahap, S.H., M.H., highlighted three key spirits that alumni should embody. The first is the spirit of unity. FH USU alumni must unite because, without unity, events like this would not be possible. He also stated that alumni should have the spirit of contribution, which does not necessarily have to be material; even a good prayer for FH USU suffices.

"There’s nothing we can’t achieve if alumni are united and contribute," said Hasrul.

Lastly, he emphasized that alumni should have a spirit of excellence. There is no difference between USU graduates and those from other universities. FH USU is on par with graduates from other prestigious law faculties.

"This is what I believe all alumni and students alike should have—the spirit of unity, contribution, and excellence. We are no less than alumni from other institutions," explained Hasrul.

Dr. Iwan Ginting, S.H., M.H., the event’s chairperson, expressed his gratitude to the alumni who contributed significantly to the success of the 70th Anniversary celebration, ensuring no serious shortcomings. He also shared his pride in being part of the FH USU family, attributing his personal development to his time at FH USU.

"I liken myself to having been nurtured at USU from 1998 to 2002, and I received quality 'nourishment,' not expired 'milk.' I am who I am today because of the excellent education provided by the Faculty of Law and my outstanding lecturers," said Dr. Iwan.

Law student Dafa Alif Alfarizi noted that this year’s FH anniversary was more enjoyable than the previous year, with more activities, competitions, and better prizes.

"In my opinion, the 70th Anniversary of FH is more exciting than last year’s. There are more activities, more competitions, and it seems the prizes are bigger this year," said Dafa.
