“Appreciation isn’t just about words. The Rector’s selfie goes beyond that,” Hadaya said.

USU PR – The selfie taken by Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., with students and committee members of the 34th National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS) at the Pancasila Hall received positive responses from students on Thursday (October 28, 2021).

Yulia, a student from USU’s Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, remarked that the Rector's selfie reflects the closeness between the university leadership and its students.

“It’s awesome; I got goosebumps seeing the Rector taking a selfie. It’s very modern and relatable,” she said.

Yulia added that such gestures are highly anticipated by students as they allow them to connect more personally with the Rector, who is widely regarded as approachable.

Hadaya, a student from the Faculty of Cultural Sciences, echoed similar sentiments, stating that the Rector’s action boosts the morale of PIMNAS participants competing in the poster exhibition.

“Appreciation isn’t just about words. The Rector’s selfie goes beyond that,” Hadaya said.

She also mentioned that other actions by the Rector garnered positive feedback from students and the academic community, including his down-to-earth gesture after the 34th PIMNAS press conference when he sat on the stage floor to put on his shoes.

“I saw the Rector sitting on the stage floor putting on his shoes. It was, as the younger generation says, ‘down to earth’ and truly remarkable,” Hadaya added.

Dr. Muryanto Amin took the selfie after participating as a speaker in a talk show as part of the 34th PIMNAS poster exhibition series. During the talk show, the Rector emphasized that universities are not just places for classroom learning but also platforms for students to hone their talents and channel their creativity.

“This talk show and poster exhibition demonstrate that students’ talents are showcased to the public and serve as solutions. This is the starting point to spark inspiration,” the Rector stated.

According to Dr. Muryanto, PIMNAS acts as a catalyst to foster collaboration between lecturers and students in producing scientific works. USU is committed to advancing the Student Creativity Program (PKM) to address societal challenges.
