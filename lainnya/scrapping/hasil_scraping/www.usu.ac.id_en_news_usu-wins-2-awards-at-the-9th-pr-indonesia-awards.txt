USU Receives Bronze Winner for Higher Education Sector in Digital Channel Category, Social Media Subcategory, and Owned Media Category, Video Profile Subcategory

DENPASAR-USU PR: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) won two awards at the 9th PR INDONESIA Awards (PRIA) held at the Aston Hotel Denpasar, Bali, on Thursday (Mar. 7). USU received the Bronze Winner award for the Higher Education Sector in the Digital Channel Category, Social Media Subcategory, and the Owned Media Category, Video Profile Subcategory.

This annual PRIA event occurred from March 5-7, 2024, preceded by a workshop themed "Communication that Inspires Civilization." PRIA received 699 entries from 219 institutions. The entries comprised various categories: owned media, digital channels, crisis management, annual reports, PR programs, PR departments, and CSR communication. The entries were judged by 16 juries of senior PR practitioners, journalists, academics, and PR Gurus. The judging process took place over four days, from January 23 to 26, 2024.

The Head of the Public Relations and Protocol Office of Universitas Sumatera Utara, Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., Psychologist, said that the awards won this year were one of the efforts of the USU Public Relations Office to continue improving innovation and skills in packaging public communication, especially as an educational institution that plays a role in inspiring civilization through more constructive communication patterns.

"The results achieved this year may not be optimal. However, we are grateful that we still managed to pass the selection process and get the Bronze Winner award. We hope that USU can achieve better results next year in this event," said the Head of Public Relations.

The competition was divided into eight assessment sectors: private corporate sector, ministry sector, institution sector, state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector, SOE subsidiary sector, regional SOE sector, local government sector, and higher education sector.
