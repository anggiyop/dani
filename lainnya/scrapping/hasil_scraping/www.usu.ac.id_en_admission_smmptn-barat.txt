About SMMPTN Barat

SMM PTN-BARAT 2025 is a selection process for new independent pathway students which is jointly organized among state universities in the Western Indonesia BKS-PTN consortium. The selection is based on the results of the computer-based written examination (UTBK), conducted collaboratively under the coordination of the SMM PTN-BARAT committee.

Participants who wish to take part in the UTBK SMM PTN-BARAT 2025 must first register online through the official registration page (https://pendaftaran.smmptnbarat.id/). The online registration process is a series of steps that must be completed by participants up to the finalization stage, which includes printing the examination card and participants are required to follow the UTBK SMM PTN-BARAT 2025 schedule as specified on the examination card.

The independent pathway for students conducted by several state universities in Western Indonesia has been running well since 2017. The joint organization of this process is seen as more efficient and facilitates more equitable access to education for all children of the nation by providing options to choose study programs at other universities within the BKS-PTN Western Indonesia. Through the SMMPTN-Barat 2025 program, high school graduates who have failed due to limited quotas or incorrect choices of study programs and universities, and therefore have not been accepted through the achievement pathway (SNBP) or the test pathway (SNBT), can reapply for selection into state universities.

The organization of SMMPTN-Barat 2025 is based on the Decree of the Chairman of BKS PTN Western Indonesia Region Number: 25-04/BKS-PTN Barat/II/2025 dated February 24, 2025, concerning the Higher Education Institutions Participating in the SMMPTN-Barat 2025 Program and the Decree of the Chairman of BKS PTN-Barat Number: 24-02/BKS PTN-Barat/I/2025 concerning the Committee of the SMMPTN-Barat 2025 Program.

Number of Study Program Options

In SMMPTN-Barat 2025, the committee does not use a group examination system. Applicants from any high school background can choose their desired study programs under the following conditions:

Participants may choose up to 2 (two) different study programs at one state university or across 2 different state universities.
The chosen study programs do not have to be at the university where the UTBK is taken.
The order of chosen study programs indicates the priority of the choices.

Test Materials

The exam materials/questions consist of two types:

First: Scholastic Potential Test;
Second: Literacy in Indonesian, Literacy in English, and Mathematical Reasoning.
The Scholastic Potential Test (TPS) measures cognitive abilities considered important for success in formal education, especially higher education. TPS assesses General Reasoning Ability, Quantitative Ability, General Knowledge and Understanding, as well as Reading and Writing Skills. Quantitative Ability includes knowledge and mastery of Basic Mathematics.
Literacy in Indonesian and English measures the ability to understand, use, evaluate, and reflect on different types of texts in order to solve problems and develop individual capacity as citizens of Indonesia and the world, to contribute productively to society.
Mathematical Reasoning measures the ability to think using concepts, procedures, facts, and mathematical tools to solve everyday problems in various relevant contexts for individuals as citizens of Indonesia and the world.
