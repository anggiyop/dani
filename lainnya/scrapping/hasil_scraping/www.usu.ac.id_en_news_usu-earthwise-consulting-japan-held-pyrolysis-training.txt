It is hope that through this activity USU can reduce plastic waste and process its own plastic so that it can reduce waste that is directly disposed of in Final Disposal Sites (TPA).

PR USU - Unversitas Sumatera Utara (USU) through the Center for Waste Recycling and Climate Change Mitigation, Environmental Engineering USU in collaboration with Earthwise Consulting Japan held technical training on the use of pyrolysis. The activity, which will be held on July 26-28, 2022, is scheduled to be filled with a series of education to the public.

The series of activities began with the material for distinguishing existing plastic types and the introduction and presentation of theoretical pyrolysis material presented by Dimas Bagus Wijanarko and Cresentiana Grace Endo. Pyrolysis itself is a thermochemical decomposition process of organic matter through a heating process without or with a little oxygen.

In addition, training activities on the use of pyrolysis equipment were also carried out at the USU Waste Disposal Site (TPS). In this training, the types of plastic used are Polypropylene (PP) and Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) with a weight of 100 kg each for each type of plastic.

It is hope that through this activity USU can reduce plastic waste and process its own plastic so that it can reduce waste that is directly disposed of in Final Disposal Sites (TPA).

This activity was attended by the Representative of Earthwise Consulting Japan, Ludfi, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Dr. Ir. Fahmi, ST., M.Sc., IPM and Vice Dean III Ir. Nismah Panjaitan, S.T., M.T., Ph.D., IPU. USU's Director of Internationalization and Global Partnerships Prof. Dr. eng. Himsar Ambarita, ST., MT., Chair of the FT USU Environment Zaid Perdana Nasution, ST., MT., Ph.D Secretary of Environmental Engineering Dr. Amir. Husin, ST., MT and USU Environmental Engineering lecturers and students.
