USU PR : On Friday, (13/01/2023), the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) formally discharged 160 inbound students participating in the 2022 Merdeka Student Exchange (PMM) program at the USU Student Center. Almost all PMM students across Indonesia found their time at the Universitas Sumatera Utara noteworthy.

According to Muhammad Zulham, S.E., M.Si, Head of the Academic Bureau of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), this student exchange opportunity should provide practical experience, comprehensive networking, and learning about the cultural richness of Medan.

"The Merdeka Student Exchange Program, which has been carried out for one semester, is expected to deliver various benefits and experiences to all participants," said the Head of the USU Academic Bureau.

Muhammad Arif Lubis SE, M.Si, PMM USU Coordinator, was thrilled with the arrival of 160 students who had selected USU as a location to study. In the future, USU will continue to improve learning to meet students' requirements.

"It must be delighted that they chose USU first, and 160 individuals attended. However, there may be advantages and disadvantages to the implementation. But, hopefully, we've done our best for these younger siblings. Perhaps this year can serve as a learning experience for future endeavors, "said the PMM Coordinator at USU.

Siti Nurrahmi Nasution, S.H., MH, Nusantara Module Supervisor, passionately explained how PMM Year 2022 USU students were very friendly with their new environment and thirsty for education about various cultures in North Sumatra.

"They are quite kind, but they are also very curious about the culture and tribal traditions of North Sumatra. I am thrilled to be a supervisor since it teaches me so much, "Nusantara Module Supervisor stated.

Nimas Nining Wardani, The 2022 PMM USU student from Airlangga University, was delighted to meet many other students from diverse regions who shared cultural differences with her.

Similarly, Mochammad Khoirul Ma'rifat, a PMM USU student from Jember University, expressed gratitude to USU for providing a learning platform backed by a sense of kinship provided by the USU academic community, professors, and USU students.
