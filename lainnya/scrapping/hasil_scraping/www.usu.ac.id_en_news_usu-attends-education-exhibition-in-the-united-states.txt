"This activity is a platform for international educators, especially USU, to build cooperative international partnerships in terms of exchanging knowledge, thoughts, and global perspectives related to the world of education. From this activity, USU also managed to record agreements with several universities from other countries," said Prof. Mury in his written statement.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) attended and was actively involved in “The 75th NAFSA Annual Conference & Expo,” which was held May 30 - June 2, 2023, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Washington D.C., United States. This activity is the largest international higher education exhibition and conference attended by more than 100 higher education institutions from various countries.

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, who attended the activity, directly explained that USU's involvement in The 75th NAFSA Annual Conference & Expo (NAFSA 75) in the United States was to establish collaboration with various universities from various countries. USU needs to offer campus internationalization programs to all NAFSA participants who attend, such as Summer Course, Student Mobility, International Mobility Staff (IMS), Sabbatical Leave, International Class, and so on.

“This activity is a platform for international educators, especially USU, to build cooperation international partnerships in terms of exchanging knowledge, thoughts, and global perspectives related to the world of education. From this activity, USU also managed to record agreements with several universities from other countries, “said Prof. Mury in his written statement Thursday (1/6/2023).

The agreements include, among others, with California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSBs), namely conducting 2 collaborations. The first is student exchange between USU and CSUBs. On this occasion, USU students will get a discount. Second, discussing the dual degree program (2+2 Transfer Articulation Program). On this occasion, the appropriate study program and curriculum exploration will be determined.

“Next is with the University of California, Irvine (UCI), which is willing to host USU students in the Student Mobility Program. Then with IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy (IMT), USU will conduct a preselection to recommend prospective doctoral students for USU S2 graduates and or USU lecturers who want to continue their Masters in Italy. These candidates will be selected by a final committee at IMT, and those who pass will be given a full scholarship to continue their PhD at IMT,” explained the rector.

An agreement has also been made with Ludwigshafen University Of Business And Society, Germany (LUBS) to collaborate where USU will host students from LUBS to complete 1 semester at USU. For this, it is necessary to select courses that meet the International Human Resources Management and Organization Study Program at LUBS.

“There are still several collaborations (with international universities) that are being followed up. The program that attracts the most attention from outside universities is the Summer Course Program. Several universities will send their representatives to take part in the Summer Course Program at USU,” he said.

NAFSA is the world's largest association dedicated to the internationalization of education and exchange. The theme for 2023 was “Inspiring an Inclusive Future,” with keynote speaker Nadia Murad (2018 Nobel Peace Prize laureate). The message conveyed in the theme is that getting an education belongs to everyone without exception.

Prof. Mury said USU participated in NAFSA for the first time because it was considered very important to introduce USU to the international academic community and as a way to accelerate adaptation to change as the meaning of Transformation Towards the Ultimate.
