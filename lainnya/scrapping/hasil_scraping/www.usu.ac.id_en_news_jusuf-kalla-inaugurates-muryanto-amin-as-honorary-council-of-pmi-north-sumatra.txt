The ceremony for the inauguration of the honorary board and management of PMI North Sumatra was also coupled with the signing of a memorandum of understanding (Mou) between PMI and community organizations, government, schools and universities, one of which was the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU).

USU PR - General Chairperson of the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) Dr. (HC) Drs. HM Jusuf Kalla (JK) inaugurated USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., as Member of the Honorary Council of PMI North Sumatra (North Sumatra) for the period 2021-2026 in T Rizal Hall Nurdin, Office of the Governor of North Sumatra Province, Monday (10/25/2021).

The ceremony for the inauguration of the honorary board and management of PMI North Sumatra was also coupled with the signing of a memorandum of understanding (Mou) between PMI and community organizations, the government of schools and universities, one of which was the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU).

Jusuf Kalla in his opening speech said that there were only three organizations whose offices were never called offices, but were called headquarters. One of them is PMI. What is the difference? If the office has working hours, but if the headquarters is 24 hours.

"PMI headquarters are open 24 hours. Whenever there is a disaster, PMI must be ready, people need blood at any time. PMI must be ready. PMI job is to help people's problems, help people who are in trouble. Help people in dealing with disasters. Ready to help people," he said.

JK said that life is not only consists of happiness, but also sadness. When there is a long sadness, that's what PMI job is. "We are here to help the community reduce the burden on the community who are suffering from disaster and sadness," he said.

Head of PMI North Sumatra Dr. H Rahmat Shah said, until now PMI in collaboration with the TNI and Polri are still working on dealing with the Sinabung eruption disaster. There are still many people affected by the eruption and the North Sumatra PMI is ready to transport water, ambulances are still on standby.

"PMI also continues to reconcile disputes among various parties. The presence of Mr. JK as a peacemaker is expected to be able to reconcile the parties to the dispute. PMI is also present to deal with Covid-19, help improve community nutrition and so on," he said.

PMI North Sumatra, he added, also signed an MoU with community organizations and seven universities. "Through this collaboration, PMI North Sumatra has received a Muri record in relation to the most blood donors for beginners by our students," he said.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin said the signing of the cooperation between USU and PMI strengthened collaboration in the humanitarian and conflict management fields. "USU will play an active role in sending students and lecturers to respond to disasters and conflicts in North Sumatra," he said.

Mury emphasized that this collaboration is a form of USU's community service related to handling humanitarian disasters and will contribute to charitable activities such as blood donation and others. (©ULC)
