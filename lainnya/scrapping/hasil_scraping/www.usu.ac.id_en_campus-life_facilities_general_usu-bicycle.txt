USU Bicycle

The USU Campus Bicycle Program is one of the initiatives to create a Green Campus at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). The program applies the bicycle-sharing concept, which promotes using bicycles together. Students can find campus bicycles at various stations located at strategic points within the campus, which are at USU's First Entrance and Second Entrance. Borrowing a bicycle is easy; students only need to show their Student Identity Card (KTM) to the nearest officer. After the officer records the student's name, they can use the campus bicycle for thirty minutes. This program aims to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions and traffic congestion in Medan City.
