The host of the activity was the University of Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal, with the center of activities at the Faculdade de Montricidade Humana, and coordinated by Ana Pipio.

USU PR - SPIRIT Project funding Erasmus Plus held a SPIRIT International Event which was held September 11-15, 2023 at the University of Lisboa, Portugal. Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) took part in this opportunity.

The activity with the theme "Inspiring Inclusion in Sports: Success Stories, Practical Skills, and Management Strategies" opened insights into the development of sports with one of the keywords 'inclusion'.

The word inclusion means including all levels of society with various limitations, including women with disabilities, and various gender differences.

The five-day event was attended by 11 universities from Portugal, Spain, Cyprus, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia as partners in the European Union's Erasmus Plus funded SPIRIT Project.

USU SPIRIT Project Coordinator, Prof Dr dr Dina Keumala Sari, M Gizi, Sp GK (K), from the Faculty of Medicine explained, the host of the activity was the University of Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal, with the activity center at Faculdade de Montricidade Humana, and coordinated by Ana Pipio.

"This event opens insights to all participants on how to develop sports with the keyword inclusion-inclu, in all forms of sports activities, especially physical enhancement," said Prof. Dina, Monday (18/9/2023).

She said, that with increased physical activity, proper nutrition is the key to preventing non-communicable diseases in the future. So the inclusion of various groups, including disabilities, is very important.

"This activity is also fully supported by USU Rector Prof Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, who provides various facilities and facilities to develop this SPIRIT project, including the development of the USU SPIRIT Club fitness and gym center at USU," he explained.

The presentation session with the topic Inclusions In High-Performance Sport was delivered by coach Ivo Quendera and paralympic international championship medalist athlete Norberto Mourao.

The presentation was about success stories and various paths to success that opened the views of all participants, including USU SPIRIT Club participants, namely Dessy Ramasari (Faculty of Dentistry), Risris Salmah Andrian (Faculty of Cultural Sciences) and Fiora Patricia Ginting (Faculty of Economics and Business).

Aside from the presentation on inclusion, the last day also gave full opportunity to students to explain all messages, impressions, and activities during this international event, as well as an event called "student premium time".

"This activity is a special activity for students to demonstrate their understanding of the SPIRIT project. Various other practical activities were carried out by all participants such as korfball games, traditional sports, and regional games, which were played together to develop sports to prevent non-communicable diseases, with young people as agents of change, "he concluded.

In the future, USU is also expected to provide the best action as part of the change. SPIRIT project activities will continue until the middle of next year and dissemination is expected to continue.
