Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that this activity is one of USU's strategies in order to meet the achievements of Higher Education IKU and run the Independent Learning Campus (MBKM) program as well as one of USU's supporters to get to the Top 500 (Five Hundred) World Class University (WCU).

HUMAS - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Socialization of Student Independent Learning (SIL) and the 2022 Academic Regulations. The activity took place at the USU Auditorium, on Thursday (09/01/2022).

"This SIL is a form of support for USU towards the Top 500 WCU," he concluded

The Rector of USU also said that the launching of SIL was to make it easier for students, lecturers, and study programs to carry out learning programs that were included in the MBKM program, such as internships, independent studies, and campus teaching.

SIL is to build cooperation with partners who want to accept students and lecturers who want to learn and teach at partner campuses.

"And to build cooperation with partners, this SIL is very much needed," said the Rector of USU.

The Rector of USU also said that with the SIL, there would be a target to be achieved, namely that all students and lecturers understand issues related to MBKM, starting from the format, model, and ways to participate in MBKM, thereby minimizing problems regarding MBKM.

"The target in the future, hopefully all students and lecturers understand the problems related to MBKM," he said.

As a PIC in Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. M. Anggia Muchtar ST., MMIT said, all of these activities are the answer to all problems of student learning activities outside the campus, so the existence of SIL is a solution.

Manager of National Accreditation at the Quality Assurance Agency Prof. Dr. Drs. Jonner Hasugian, M.Si said that the quality assurance agency supports and encourages all study programs by providing all the best facilities to improve the Higher Education database because this is to improve USU's accreditation. And it takes a commitment for the academic community to want to change for the better in the future.

"The quality assurance agency supports all study programs to improve the database in order to increase USU's accreditation in the future," said Prof. Jonner. (©ULC)
