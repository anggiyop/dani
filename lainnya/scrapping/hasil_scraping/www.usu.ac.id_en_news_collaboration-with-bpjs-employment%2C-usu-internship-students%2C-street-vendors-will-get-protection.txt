The Rector said that not only about guarantees of protection for students, various forms of cooperation in the field of education must also be designed and realized.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is collaborating with the Employment Social Security Administration (BPJS) regarding protection for USU students who are running internship programs, real work lectures (KKN) or field work practices (PKL) as well as in the provision of education and institutional development.

This collaboration was confirmed in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between USU and BPJS Employment, at the Rector's official residence, Wednesday (12/1/2021).

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said that the scheme regarding guarantees for students who carry out this practice is something new for the university.

"We will discuss the scheme, it is necessary to calculate the financing and recovery, hopefully it can be realized soon," he said.

The Rector said that BPJS Employment and USU are expected to support each other in improving quality. "We are talking about the needs of BPJS which we can support, especially those related to localistics, this case regarding localistics is interesting to see," the Rector continued.

Dr. Muryanto added, not only about guarantees of protection for students, various forms of cooperation in the field of education must also be designed and realized.

"This collaboration is expected to support the development of skills, knowledge and innovation of the USU academic community," he said.

The Rector hopes that this MoU can be followed up with immediate implementation, and can be formulated in detail the concept of activities and their outputs to be implemented. On the same occasion, BPJS Employment Director General and HR Abdur Rahman Irsyadi said his party and USU would hold a special collaboration.

"Research in the field of social security is still relatively rare, so we open up opportunities for the academic community and students to produce research proposals on this topic, we will help finance it," explained Abdur.

Furthermore, BPJS Ketenagakerjaan also wants to build literacy on social security among campuses.

"At BPJS Ketenagakerjaan, we have a main program, one of which is work accident insurance, which will be applied to USU students who are practicing work," he said.
