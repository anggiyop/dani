"We are thinking about how we can continue to improve our cooperation with Japan.Many of our lecturers are also Japanese graduates.So Japan is not a new person for us, but a USU partner who has been workingtogether for along time,” the USU Rector said.

During his visit, Takonai brought a message of increasing cooperation between the Government of Indonesia and the Government of Japan through various sectors, and one of them was in the education sector.He said the tasks he was carrying out are focused on cooperation with agencies in the city of Medan.

“I have only been stationed for about three months in Medan.The mandate given to me is to increase cooperation between Indonesia and Japan in various sectors, one of which is in education.That's why Icame here," said Takoai.

In line with this, Muryanto Amin said that his party is currently seeking assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) which aims to encourage the implementation of various development projects at USU.As is known, JICA hascollaborated with USU in many ways.

“Currently we are proposing development assistance at USU to JICA through the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology.We know that JICA has helped us a lot, such as research funding and so on,” said Muryanto.

Muryanto Amin also mentioned that Japan is a role model country for waste management.According to him, many collaborations on waste management procedures have been initiated by USU and the Japanese Government.

“Previously, we have also cooperated with Japan regarding waste management.Of course, we can't immediately be like Japan, but the results of the study have become our recommendations for better waste management inMedanCity," he said.
