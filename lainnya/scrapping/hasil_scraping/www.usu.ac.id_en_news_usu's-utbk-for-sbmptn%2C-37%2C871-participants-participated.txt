The Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Sc. represented by the Vice-Rector (VR1) 1 USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH., MA, as the Head in Charge of UTBK for the North Sumatra Region stated that there were 37,871 exam participants at USU which were divided into two waves. The first batch will be held from 17 to 23 May 2022, and the second batch from 28 May to 3 June 2022.

"Today is the first day of UTBK held by LTMPT throughout Indonesia, and at USU there are 37,871 participants," said USU VR 1 during the review.

Edy explained that the allocation of exams for participants taking UTBK at USU amounted to 2,424 seats, so the exam scheme was divided into morning and afternoon sessions. In addition, Edy Ikhsan explained that of the 37,871 participants, the field of Science and Technology (Saintek) dominated with 19 thousand registrants.

"The list of participants is divided into three, 19,704 were selected for Saintek, while 14,683 for Soshum, and 3,484 mixed," explained Edy Ikhsan.
