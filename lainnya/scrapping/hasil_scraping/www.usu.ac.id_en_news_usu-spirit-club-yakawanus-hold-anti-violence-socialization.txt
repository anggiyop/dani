USU PR - Seeing the high rate of violence and bullying against women and children, the USU SPIRIT Club, together with YAKAWANUS, held a socialization on the importance of protection against violence and bullying against women and children Wednesday (10/1/2024).

This activity featured Prof.Dr. dr. Elmeida Effendy, M.Ked., (KJ), SpKJ (K), as the speaker, presented about violence and bullying against women and children. Meanwhile, USU SPIRIT Club explained various bullying problems in sports training.

Prof. Dr. dr. Dina Keumala Sari, M.Gizi, SpGK, as the coordinator of the USU SPIRIT Project, said that sharing experiences, especially for fields that experience violence and bullying, is needed, not only in domestic life but also in sports. On that occasion, one of the USU SPIRIT Club members, Fiora Patricia Ginting, shared stories about bullying around her.

This activity is in collaboration with the North Sumatra Aceh Women's Association (IKWASU) in socializing legal aid and mental health offered by the Kawalan Wanita dan Anak Nusantara Foundation (YAKAWANUS). The basis for the formation of the foundation is the fact that women and children are still often victims of various forms of violence, which are often committed by those closest to them and have a negative impact on the victim's life.

The formation of YAKAWANUS is a serious response to the issue, with Dr. Nurfida Khairina Arrasyid, M.Kes, as the founding motivator. The foundation is a charitable organization dedicated to protecting women and children throughout the archipelago with the sincere aim of helping to provide much-needed solutions, support and protection to women and children as individuals who are most vulnerable to experiencing various forms of violence in society.

The assistance services provided by YAKAWANUS are in the form of legal advice in the defense of a case, legal assistance both inside and outside the court, mental health counseling and channeling / organizing non-formal education assistance, skills courses, training, etc. This socialization also includes educational sub-work activities from the North Sumatra Aceh Women's Association (IKWASU) chaired by Prof. Dr. Rohani Ganie, M.Hum.

Prof. Rohani stated that the activity could increase knowledge for Acehnese women, especially those in North Sumatra. This IKWASU activity has been running for the last 5 (five) years and has provided gait for Acehnese women to develop further.
