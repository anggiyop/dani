Description

Referring to the Regulation of the Minister of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia Number 3 of 2020 concerning National Higher Education Standards, Article 16, Paragraph (3), which states that an academic year consists of two semesters and that universities may organize an inter-semester, the implementation of the inter-semester is regulated as follows:

The inter-semester applies to undergraduate (Sarjana) and diploma (Diploma Tiga) students.
The implementation of the inter-semester includes lectures, midterm exams (UTS), and final exams (UAS).
Students must be actively enrolled in the even semester of the ongoing academic year.
Courses with grades of E, D, C, and C+ can be retaken during the inter-semester period.
Courses involving laboratory work, practicums, and/or mandatory assignments are not eligible for the inter-semester.
Students taking inter-semester courses cannot enroll in the Community Service Program (KKN).
Inter-semester courses will only be conducted if at least 10 students enroll in a class, except for courses that are being removed due to curriculum revisions.
Students registered for inter-semester courses cannot cancel them and must pay the tuition fee in full.
The tuition fee for inter-semester courses is Rp 200,000 (two hundred thousand rupiahs) per credit per student.
The inter-semester must include at least 16 face-to-face sessions, and students may take a maximum of 9 credits.
