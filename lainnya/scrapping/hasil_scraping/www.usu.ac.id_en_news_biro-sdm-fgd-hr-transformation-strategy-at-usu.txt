Without reliable human resources who are able to innovate and keep up with changing technology, the targets and goals to be achieved by USU's organisations cannot be realised, explained the 2nd Vice Rector.

HUMAS USU - The Bureau of Human Resources (HR) and Finance of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) discussing USU Human Resources Transformation 2023. This activity was held on March 14-16, 2023 at the USU Faculty of Nursing Hall. On this occasion, the USU Vice Rector 2 for Human Resources and Finance, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos. M.SP, started the discussion by mapping the problems of staff within USU. According to the 2nd Vice Rector of USU, HR plays an important role as a barometer of the progress or decline of an organization.

“Without reliable human resources who are able to innovate and keep up with changing technology, the targets and goals to be achieved by USU's organisations cannot be realised,” explained the 2nd Vice Rector.

He also explained the USU Strategic Plan for 2020-2024, which is to create an academic community and staff who are able to compete at a global level.

Through this FGD, we could learn about USU employees' performance. Head of USU Bureau of Human Resources, Dra. Syafnita H. Silalahi, M.SP, explained that this discussion would resolve the obstacles experienced by each USU work unit.

"This FGD is intended to find out and assess employee performance to make it more effective and to see the competence of each individual. We are collecting data from each work unit on the problems of teaching staff in their respective work units. From there, we will draw conclusions from the results of this discussion, then we will find a way to solve it," explained the Head of the USU Bureau of HR.

To follow up, in the near future, the USU Bureau of Human Resources and Finance will organize training and technical guidance to improve the competence of educators within USU.

"After this, we will hold training and technical guidance to improve the competence of the education personnel," she concluded.
