About Teater O USU Student Activity Unit

Teater O USU is one of the oldest student activity units at USU. Established in 1991, Teater O USU carries the motto, "To be present and exist, not just to come and breathe." This student activity unit operates in the field of arts, specifically theater, which is a combination of drama, dance, music, and literature. Apart from working on its own performances, Teater O USU is also often invited to various arts events. Teater O USU always provides opportunities for students to express themselves through culturally-themed works with a satirical comedy genre. Joining Teater O USU allows students to develop social skills and unleash their creativity. Every year, Teater O USU offers USU students the chance to develop their talents and creativity.
