"RSGM USU is able to provide added economic value for USU," said the Rector.

USU PR - The Dental and Oral Hospital (RSGM) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) will be developed to be a business unit. This was conveyed by the Rector of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in celebration of the 4th Anniversary of the USU Hospital on Sunday (3/6/2022).

In his remarks, the Rector said that the USU RSGM has great potential to become an academic business unit that has two functions, namely as an educational service for students and a commercial service for the community.

"RSGM USU is able to provide added economic value for USU," he said.

The first step that will be taken is structuring the infrastructure by carefully design the RSGM management business plan.

"As a university leader, this is a commitment to be able to allocate the budget to build the RSGM in stages," he continued.

According to the Rector, USU as a PTN-BH must be good at finding funds for various needs. Not only built for student services, the various assets at USU must be empowered by their two functions, namely the function of Tri Darma services and economic value added.

"So not only teaching students about scientific substance but also teaching entrepreneurship to students," added Dr. Muryanto.

Dr. Muryanto hopes that, at the age of 4, RSGM can develop a better development program and become one of the business units at USU.

In line with this, the Deputy Chair of the Indonesian Education RSGM Association, drg. Andi Tajrin, M.Kes., Sp.BM(K) hopes that RSGM will grow as a business unit at USU.

"Of course the basic is back for the interests of students to be fulfilled, then we will commercialize it," he said.

Moreover, according to drg. Andi Tajrin, USU's RSGM is one of the RSGMs with the best facilities and complete human resources in North Sumatra.

On the same occasion, the Director of the RSGM USU, drg. Rahmi Syaflida, Sp.BM(K) said, RSGM USU is ready to become a business unit by completing facilities and infrastructure.

"This is a passion for us to provide better performance in the future, RSGM USU will be the best educational vehicle for students and benefit the people of North Sumatra," he said. (©ULC)
