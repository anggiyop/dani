We hope that this visitation will get the best results so that later it can produce graduates who are competent and ready to contribute to society and the world of medicine globally," said Prof Opim.

USU PR - The Faculty of Medicine of Universitas Sumatera Utara (FK USU) received a visit from the Indonesian Medical Council to assess the feasibility of opening a Subspecialist Medical Education Programme (Sp2) in Internal Medicine. The opening occurred over two days in the FK USU Hall Friday (21/072023).

On this occasion, Vice Rector IV for Information, Planning, and Development of USU Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc, revealed that the Sp2 Program is to produce third professional degree personnel, continuing Internal Medicine Specialist Education.

Vice-Rector IV explained that this visitation is a stage that must be carried out to ensure that the Sp2 FK USU Medical is ready to conduct professional education. Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, MSc, hopes that the results of the visitation of the Sp2 FK USU Education Program will get the best assessment.

"We hope that this visitation will get the best results so that later it can produce graduates who are competent and ready to contribute to society and the world of medicine globally," said Prof. Opim.

Previously, the USU Rector opened the Subspecialist Education Program on a university-based basis on 17 September 2020.

Meanwhile, various preparations have been made by USU’s Faculty of Medicine’s Sp2 Medical Education Program to anticipate this visitation—Dean of FK USU Prof. Dr. dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe, Sp.S (K), admitted that he had prepared several documents needed by the councilors.

"We have prepared several documents according to the request from the Indonesian Medical Council and pray that the visitation that runs today and tomorrow can run smoothly," concluded Prof Aldy.

After this visitation, the Sp2 Medical Education Program will improve the input provided by the councilors for the progress of this education program.

"So one of the references is the recommendation we hope to get from the honorable councilors," he added—one of the councilors, dr Mariatul Fadilah, MARS, Sp. KKLP, Ph.D., explained that the process was highlighted in this visitation, starting from the teachers to the supporting education facilities. According to him, the counselor must protect the community to get competent doctor services.

We do not assess the institution, but we assess the educational process so that it produces a quality graduate by the standards. That is the duty of the councilor," said Dr Mariatul.
