This coaching session was attended by sixty participants, including both students and professors. Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si. Apt., Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Collaboration at USU, stated that USU would assist the participants in learning how to obtain scholarship programs.

USU PR: Tuesday (March 14, 2023) at the Prof. Dr. Suhajdi Hadibroto Hall, FEB USU, the Directorate of Internationalisation and Global Partnerships of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), hosted a coaching clinic for master's and doctoral students who will continue their studies in the United States.

This event, titled "Strategies to Apply for Master's and Ph.D. Programs at U.S. Institutions," featured several speakers from USAID FRIENDS LPDP addressing Alumni of the American-Indonesian Scholarship Program Alumni Association (ALPHA-1).

This coaching session was attended by sixty individuals, including both students and professors. Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si. Apt., Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Collaboration at USU, stated that USU would assist participants in learning how to obtain a scholarship scheme.

Prof. Poppy stated, "The next stage is to assist professors and students who wish to attend college in obtaining scholarships because this is not to obtain the scholarship, but to understand how to obtain it."

In addition, Vice Rector III of USU noted that this activity contains provisions for creating CVs and advice for locating the finest school there.

"The prerequisites vary depending on the provided school. Thus, this activity will equip them. Indeed, if they are equipped to prepare applications and CVs, then they should learn to search for the greatest institutions in America," he explained.

Formerly, only Java students were given priority for this type of activity, according to the Secretary Director of the USU Directorate of Global Partnerships. The presence of the USAID TEMAN LPDP, according to Arif Nuryawan, S.Hut., M.Si., Ph.D., expanded chances for Sumatran students. He expects USU students, faculty, and staff to be more readily accepted at American universities.

"Now that the USAID TEMAN LPDP has arrived, Sumatra Island, particularly the Universitas Sumatera Utara, has a higher priority. Thus, we have made it easier for USU graduates who are going to Masters or staff or lecturers who are going to Doctoral Programs to be accepted into American colleges more quickly," stated Arif Nuryawan.
