"We can follow up on this MoU later, establishing cooperation that will provide mutual benefits. We hope there is a special MBKM program that will be discussed with BRI, or there are also new program innovations," said Prof. Mury.

USU PR - Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Tuesday (01/08/2023).

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said this cooperation would later support the development of skills, science and innovation. This collaboration is expected to carry out digital talent scouting, which is a series of competency development programs in the field of information and communication technology (ICT) for students.

“USU students are selected directly with partners who collaborate with USU. Later, with other partners, we created an innovation program. For example, whether to do digital talent scouting was done about 2 months ago. Because this talent scouting also provides many benefits,” said Prof. Muryanto.

Based on the USU Rector's statement, the signing of this MoU will be followed up with a number of collaborations supported by the MBKM program.

“We can follow up on this MoU later, establishing cooperation that will provide mutual benefits. We hope there is a special MBKM program that will be discussed with BRI, or there are also new program innovations,” he continued.

BRI Regional Head of Consumer Banking, Herdiman, said that the cooperation carried out this time was not only in terms of banking but also in other matters. Later, this collaboration will also provide scholarships to USU students.

“We have cooperation. BRI has a Baitul Maal Foundation to provide scholarship assistance, and we can also provide it to USU students who hopefully need help easing the burden of their education fees,” he said.

Furthermore, Herdiman revealed that BRI provides opportunities for students to work in the banking sector.

“We can expand our cooperation by also conducting job openings for USU students who have graduated or are about to graduate, whereas if there are job opportunities at BRI, we also prioritize USU students. Apart from that, there are also many collaborations that we can do, “he said.
