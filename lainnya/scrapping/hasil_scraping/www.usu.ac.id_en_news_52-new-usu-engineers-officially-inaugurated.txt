“We hope that the new engineers can bring positive changes for the progress of the nation, especially in the sector that is currently being most concerned, namely infrastructure, concluded the Head of PSPPI.”

USU PR - The Professional Engineer Education Study Program (PS PPI) of the Faculty of Engineering (FT), Universitas Sumatera Utara, held an inauguration process for 52 graduates of the XII Batch of PS PPI. The inauguration took place at the USU Faculty of Engineering Hall, on Tuesday (07/20/2024).

The hope for the inaugurated graduates was spoken by the Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., to be able to be fully dedicated to the profession by working and producing superior work or innovation that not only makes the Universitas Sumatera Utara proud but also supports acceleration and equity that can realize a prosperous Indonesian society.

Dr. Eng. Ir. Listiani Nurul Huda MT., IPU, as Head of the FT USU Professional Education Study Program, also hopes that the new engineers can continue to contribute to the progress of the nation professionally and ethically and have good environmental insight.
