“We also appreciate this performance, which is part of the INDONESIANA program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology with LPDP,” said Prof. Fidel.

USU PR - The Ethnomusicology Study Program of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a concert entitled “Jelajah Gambus Nusantara: Developing Innovative Works with a World Fusion Approach” on Friday, (11/15/2024) at the Student Center. The event was also attended by the Consul General of Japan in Medan, Dr. Susumu Takonai.

 

The event was a manifestation of the success of Suarasama, a music group formed by the Head of the Ethnomusicology Study Program, Dra, Rithaony Hutajulu, MA and her husband in 1995, in exploring gambus music in various parts of Indonesia, including North Sumatra, East Kalimantan, Riau, and Bangka Belitung. Until now, Suarasama has conducted mini-tour concerts in various major cities in Indonesia and performed at various international world music festivals.

 

In his remarks, USU Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp.F.E.R, representing the USU Rector appreciated the “INDONESIANA” program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Kemendikbudristek) which funded this project through the Innovative Creative Work Creation (PKKI) category grant for the 2023-2024 fiscal year.

 

“We also appreciate this performance, which is part of the INDONESIANA program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology with LPDP,” said Prof. Fidel.

 

Furthermore, the USU Secretary reminded the importance of creativity in maintaining and developing Indonesian culture. He hopes that this concert will not only be entertainment but also introduce the richness of Indonesian culture through an innovative World Fusion approach.

 

“We hope that this concert is not just an art performance but also a reflection of the richness of Indonesian culture that is able to adapt, innovate, and go global,” said Fidel.

 

Dra. Rithaony Hutajulu, MA. Interpreted this event as a medium to introduce the richness of music, especially traditional music that is often considered old-fashioned.

 

“Actually, if we work on it, it has a distinctive strength and identity from various music, including Nusantara music,” explained Rithaony.

 

Before holding the concert, Rithaony explained that Suarasama had conducted in-depth research in four regions of Indonesia. As a result of this research, Suarasama created a music album featuring gambus instruments. The album contains new works, old works, and traditional songs rearranged with a touch of Suarasama's distinctive musical style.

 

“There are 4 regions that we surveyed, namely in Belitung, Riau, North Sumatra and Kalimantan,” said Rithaony.
