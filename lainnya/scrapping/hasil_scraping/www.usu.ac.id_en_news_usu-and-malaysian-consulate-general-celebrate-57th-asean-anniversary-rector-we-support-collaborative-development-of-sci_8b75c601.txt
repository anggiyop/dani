The 57th ASEAN anniversary is a crucial milestone in the history of Southeast Asian nations that initiated the establishment of an organization symbolizing cooperation, unity, and stability. Over the past 57 years, ASEAN has demonstrated a strong commitment to advancing peace, prosperity, and development among its member countries.

USU PR — The Consulate General of Malaysia in Medan and Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a "Celebration of the 57th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Day," marking a significant moment to commemorate the long journey of cooperation and unity among Southeast Asian nations. The event took place at the USU Digital Learning Building Center on Wednesday, Aug. 14.

 

The event was attended by the Regional Secretary of North Sumatra, Ir. Arief Sudarto Trinugroho, M.T., the Consul General of Malaysia in Medan, H.E. Shahril Nizam Abdul Malek, and the Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si.

 

The 57th ASEAN anniversary is a crucial milestone in the history of Southeast Asian nations that initiated the establishment of an organization symbolizing cooperation, unity, and stability. Over the past 57 years, ASEAN has demonstrated a strong commitment to advancing peace, prosperity, and development among its member countries.

 

The Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., on behalf of the USU academic community, expressed his gratitude to the Consulate General of Malaysia in Medan for initiating this event and partnering with USU.

 

The Rector emphasized that it was an honor for the USU academic community to participate in celebrating the 57th anniversary of ASEAN. He also explained that as an educational institution, USU welcomes opportunities for collaboration and supports ideas that prioritize cooperation and the development of science and technology. This is expected to contribute to enhancing the progress and prosperity of ASEAN countries.

 

"Hopefully, the aspirations of the ASEAN founders can be realized through collaborative steps developed from this forum," he said.

 

The Head of the USU ASEAN Study Center, Dr. Jelly Leviza, S.H., M.Hum., explained that this was not the first collaboration of its kind. Previously, there had been similar collaborations. Such celebratory events are expected to serve as an information platform for students, academics at USU, and practitioners to enhance their knowledge about ASEAN.

 

Dr. Jelly Leviza added that this program involves students as the primary audience. She hopes that in the future, students will be able to understand ASEAN more deeply, recognize the complexities of issues arising within ASEAN, and realize the vast scope of ASEAN in the political, security, economic, and socio-cultural fields, encompassing the three pillars of ASEAN.

 

"Students, as the next generation, need to understand the complexities of ASEAN issues, whether in the political, security, economic, or socio-cultural fields," she emphasized.
