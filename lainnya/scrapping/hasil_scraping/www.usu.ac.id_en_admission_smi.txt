About SMI

Becoming a World Class University can be achieved through excellent research, a conducive academic atmosphere, adequate facilities, and several specific indicators. One important indicator is implementing internationalization so the university can be categorized as a World Class University or a world-class campus. The parameter for internationalization that needs to be carried out by higher education institutions is recruiting the best prospective students from other countries (international students). In other words, the university's international reputation will increase if it becomes a preferred choice for prospective students from foreign countries.

In line with this, Universitas Sumatera Utara also conducts the International Student Selection (SMI) to choose international students with the qualifications and requirements to be accepted as USU students in order to meet the targets set by the Ministry for WCU. The selection process is carried out carefully and comprehensively, starting from the registration stage to the final selection stage. The rigorous and comprehensive selection is expected to attract high-quality international students who have the potential to develop themselves and contribute to improving the quality of education at USU and in their home countries.
