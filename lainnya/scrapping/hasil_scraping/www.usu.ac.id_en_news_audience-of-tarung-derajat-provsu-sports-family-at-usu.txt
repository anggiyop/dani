Earlier it was discussed with the Rector that we will do training at USU because many USU students including USU Lecturers are also active Tarung Derajat members who have practiced Tarung Derajat martial arts. There are even USU students who have performed well in the Provincial Sports Week, "explained the Chairman of Pengprov Tarung Derajat North Sumatra.

USU PR - Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si received a visit from the North Sumatra Tarung Derajat Sports Family in the Rector's Audience Room, Wednesday (27/09/2023). During this visit, the Tarung Derajat Sports Family tried to establish friendships and introduce this martial sport at USU.

Tarung Derajat itself is a combined martial art because it does not only focus on punches, kicks, or locks but also a combination of these. This martial art from West Java has been competed in various national and international championships.

Chairman of Pengprov Tarung Derajat North Sumatra, Tasimin said he was discussing with the USU Rector about the Tarung Derajat training plan at USU, considering that there are USU lecturers and students who are actively involved in Tarung Derajat.

According to Tasimin's information, USU even has students who excel in this field and become one of the 22 athletes prepared for the 2024 National Sports Week.

"Earlier it was discussed with the Rector that we will make training at USU because many USU students including USU Lecturers are also active members of Tarung Derajat who have practiced Tarung Derajat martial arts. There are even USU students who have performed well in the Provincial Sports Week, "explained the Chairman of the North Sumatra Tarung Derajat Pengprov.

Furthermore, Tasimin hopes Tarung Derajat can be an UKM at USU because there are still many students who are unfamiliar with Tarung Derajat which not only prioritizes martial arts skills but also teaches moral values, morals, agility, and other positive values.

"Earlier we talked about making an exercise, we also hope Tarung Drajat can become one of the UKM at USU so that it can be a forum for USU students," he added.
