Seeing your brighter future. The future is a gate that we must go through later. We must build and dream of that future from now on, not later, "said Prof. Mury.

USU PR - A total of 8,393 new students of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) 2023 packed the USU Mini Stadium at the Opening of the New Student Campus Introduction (PKKMB), on Friday (18/08/2023).

With the theme "Building a Bright Future Together". This theme means a bright future collaboration and contributes to the progress of USU by producing excellent students and alumni.

In line with what was said by the USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., new students must plan for the future from now on.

"See your brighter future. The future is a gate that we must go through later. We must build and dream of that future from now on, not later," said Prof. Mury.

The USU Chancellor also conveyed a message to new students, that during the lecture period, we must explore everything to find out what we want.

"When you enter as a student, what is needed and the most is the intention. Devote yourself to exploring what we will get. Explore everything you want to know in the lecture process. I mean that exploration should not be limited, and there should be no obstacles when we want to know what we want to know, "explained the USU Chancellor.

Director of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE, M.Si., said that what made the difference between this year's PKKMB and last year was that new students had received USU alma mater jackets.

"Overall, the difference is that starting this year, for the first time, the alma mater jacket is pinned on, because for the first time for the new batch, it can be handed over before PKKMB. Then the second is something new too," he said.

PKKMB, which is scheduled to last for 3 consecutive days, invited Fiki Naki as an inspirational figure. He is expected to inspire students to be part of globalization by mastering foreign languages
