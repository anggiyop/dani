USU PR - The USU League Table Tennis Tournament Series 4 was again successfully held at the Cikal Sports Building, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Sunday (15/12). In the USU League Series 4, the 1st place was won by Jimmy from PTM Angsapura after defeating Aditya from PTM TSP in the final with a score of 3-0 (11-9, 11-6, 11-6). Meanwhile, the joint 3rd place was won by Mono from PTM Global Permai and Latief from PTM Kenanga. The winners of the USU League Series 4 not only received trophies, but also medals, certificates, and coaching money.

 

The division 6 singles tournament itself was attended by 99 participants from 33 PTMs in Medan City and its surroundings. The high interest of the participants to join the tournament was evident when the flyers were distributed on the first day, there were around 40 table tennis players who registered.

 

In fact, three days before the closing of registration, the quota of participants has been fulfilled, the high interest of the participants can also be seen from the participants who are willing to enter the waiting list to join the Series 4 League.

 

The tournament itself was opened by the Vice Chairman of PTMSI Medan City, Hendra Irsan. He appealed and hoped that table tennis tournaments like this should continue to be encouraged in order to produce potential table tennis athletes in Medan, in particular and in North Sumatra in general.

 

The Chairperson of the USU League Table Tennis Tournament Series 4 Committee, Prof. Dr. Drs. Mulyadi, M. Hum, said that the USU League Series 4 is a continuation of the USU League Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3.

 

“In Series 1, Raffa from PTM Perhimpunan Indonesia-Tionghoa (PIT) Medan won first place, in Series 2 the first winner was Rasyid from PTM TSP Medan, and in Series 3 the first winner was Noval from PTM Sinar Jaya,” said Prof. Mulyadi.

 

Prof. Mulyadi explained, the implementation of this tournament aims to provide a forum for table tennis players to test their abilities and at the same time look for potential seeds in the table tennis branch in North Sumatra.

 

“Each series, we also continue to increase the prize for the winner,” he said.

 

Prof. Mulyadi, who also serves as Head of the Linguistics Master and Doctoral Study Program, expressed his gratitude to Vice Rector V who manages the assets of GOR Cikal USU, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and the lecturers, students, and alumni who have been very supportive of this activity so that the event carried out by PTM Cikal USU and sponsored by the Linguistics Study Program of the Faculty of Cultural Sciences USU can take place smoothly.

 

“Hopefully we can run this USU League until the 12th series,” he added.

 

Prof. Mulyadi explained, the plan is that the champions for each series will be invited to the main league to compete for bigger prizes.
