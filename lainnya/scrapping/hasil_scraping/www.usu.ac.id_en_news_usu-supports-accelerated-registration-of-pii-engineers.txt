USU PUBLIC RELATIONS – MEDAN: The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.SI., said USU would support the acceleration of engineer registration through the Indonesian Engineers Association (PII). He asked the USU academic community to participate here.

In his statement at an online hearing with the PII Headquarter on Friday (9/3/2021), Muryanto Amin hopes that USU lecturers and alumni can immediately register the engineer. This is because the engineering profession requires protection and is also important as an official sign of membership.

This is very important and we fundamentally support this accelerated engineer registration program. We want our engineers to join PII in order to get protection and also as official proof of membership,” said Muryanto. The Executive Director of the PII Secretariat Implementing Body, Ir. Faizal Safa, ST, MSc., IP, U ASEAN Eng, conveyed this program as a form of transformation carried out by the PII management that soon will end.

“Ini menjadi nilai transformasi keinsinyuran dan kepengurusan PII yang akan berakhir. Kita ingin memberikan registrasi agar tidak ada hal yang tidak diinginkan nantinya,” kata Faizal.

“This is the value of PII’s engineering and management transformation which will end. We want to provide registration so that there are no undesirable things later,” Faizal said.

He said that recently there have been various cases involving the engineer profession. In trials, the engineer profession is often called as an expert witness. The role as an expert witness is considered vulnerable and the engineer needs legal protection.

“There are cases where engineers are called as expert witnesses. Usually, the engineer will be asked about his registration mark. There was once a case hen an engineer could not show his registration sign and was sued again,” he said.

On that occasion the Rector of USU mandated the Dean of the USU Faculty of Engineering to recruit lecturers and alumni to register. Socialization will be carried out as the first step to attract lecturers and alumni to register.

Present at the meeting were Professor of Geophysical Engineering ITB, Prof. Dr. Djoko Santoso, MSc., IPU, ASEAN Eng, Secretary General of PII Headquarter, Ir. Teguh Haryono, MBA, USUVice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt, and the Rector’s Expert Staff. (RR/©ULC)
