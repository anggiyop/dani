Description

Follow-up on the Cancellation of the 2024 UKT Increase

Based on Letter Number 0511/E/PR.07.04/2024 issued by the Director General of Higher Education and Technology on May 27, 2024 to the Rector of State Universities regarding the Cancellation of the Increase in UKT and IPI for the 2024/2025 Academic Year. The follow-up actions taken by Universitas Sumatera Utara are:

1. Universitas Sumatera Utara revokes the Rector's Decree regarding the UKT and IPI rates for State Universities for the 2024/2025 academic year.

2. Universitas Sumatera Utara will resubmit the UKT and IPI rates no later than June 5, 2024, without an increase compared to the rates for the 2023/2024 academic year and in accordance with the maximum limit provisions in the Regulation of the Minister of Education, Culture, Research and Technology (Permendikbudristek) Number 2 of 2024 concerning the Standard Unit Cost of Higher Education Operations (SSBOPT)

at State Universities within the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology

3. Universitas Sumatera Utara will revise the Rector's Decree regarding the UKT and IPI rates for the 2024/2025 academic year based on recommendations or letters of approval from the Director General of Higher Education.

4. Universitas Sumatera Utara ensures that no new 2024/2025 academic year students will pay higher UKT due to the revision of the Rector's Decree.

5. Universitas Sumatera Utara will inform new students who have been accepted or declared to have graduated of the UKT and IPI rates in accordance with the revised Rector's Decree.

6. If there is an excess payment of UKT due to the revision of the Rector's Decree, Universitas Sumatera Utara will refund the excess payment or adjust the calculation of UKT payments for the following semester

7. For students who have made UKT payments according to the schedule (while waiting for the implementation of point 6, if applicable), please follow the next stages according to the schedule provided.

8. For students who have not made payments and/or have not undergone a health check, a reschedule of payments and health checks will be given after the issuance of the revision of the Decree of the Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara on the 2024/2025 UKT rates and the revision of the imposition of student UKT.

9. Submissions for review, refunds of excess payments, and other matters related to the revision of the amount of UKT rates can only be processed after the issuance of the Decree of the Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara regarding the revision of the 2024/2025 UKT rates based on the recommendation of the Ministry. After the Rector's determination regarding the new 2024/2025 UKT, the previous UKT determination will be converted to the new UKT. The decision results from the UKT review application are adjusted to the problems submitted and the new UKT rates.
