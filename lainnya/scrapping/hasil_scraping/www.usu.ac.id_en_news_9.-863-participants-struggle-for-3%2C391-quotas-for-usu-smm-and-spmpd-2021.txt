According to Dr. Muryanto Amin, a review of the two test locations was carried out to find out the process of implementing the two selections carried out by USU directly.Especially considering that the examination was carried out during a pandemic where participants, supervisors and all involved committees were required to apply strict health protocols for not generating new clusters of Covid-19.

The SMM and SPMPD exams will take place from 4 to 9 July 2021.The announcement of the results of the SMM exam will be announced on July 17, 2021 and the results of the SPMPD exam will be announced on July 22, 2021.

"The capacity for USU Independent route is 2,696 participants and for the Diploma Program is 1,235 new students," said USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., to the journalistsafter the review.

He said that from the review that was carried out and none of any obstacles were found in the implementation of the exam.“The exams were carried out under strict health protocols.Before entering the room, all participants were checked for body temperature and had to wash their hands properly,” Dr. Muryanto said.

Asked about the tuition fees for the Independent and Diploma pathways, Dr. Muryanto confirmed that there was no increase at all.However, his party has planned a Single Tuition Fee (UKT) scheme for Mandiri students starting in2022.

“This year, UKT cannot be implemented for Independent students because the Rector Regulation has not yet been made.In addition, we will first see what friends at other PTNs have done about the UKT scheme for students on the Independent pathway.Reportedly, UGM and ITB have made a scholarship scheme and UKT for independent students," he explained.

The Rector also stated that face-to-face lectures during the current Covid-19 pandemic cannot be carried out, in line with the policies issued by the North Sumatra Provincial Government.However, USU has prepared the format and module for face-to-face lectures, so thatwhen there is a policy to reopen face-to-face lectures,USU is ready to implement it.

“We prepare 50:50 formats. This means that 50 percent learning in class and 50 percent learn online.Of course we still follow the policies of the North Sumatra Provincial Government.As long as the Covid-19 Task Force Team has not allowed face-to-face lecturing, USU will comply.Originally, face-to-face lecturing were scheduled to start in August, but pursuant to the policy of the North Sumatra Covid-19 Task Force, face-to-face lecturing are not allowed," he said.(RJ/©ULC)
