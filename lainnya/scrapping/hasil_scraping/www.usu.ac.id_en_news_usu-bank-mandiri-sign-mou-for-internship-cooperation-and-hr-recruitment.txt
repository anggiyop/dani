USU-PUBLIC RELATIONS – MEDAN: The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has confirmed its cooperation with PT.

Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk was represented by Erlangga Hanafie as Regional CEO of Bank Mandiri Region I/Sumatra I.

Also witnessing were Bank Mandiri Deputy Director Alexandra Askandar and Bank Mandiri Compliance and HR Director Agus Dwi Handaya, USU Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt, Expert Staff of Vice Rector III Siti Salmiah, drg., Sp.KGA, Head of the Educational Development and Service Unit (UPP), Dan of the Faculty of Engineering, Dan of the Faculty of Law, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business and Dean of the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology.

In his remarks, the Rector of USU said that the signing of the MoU between the two institutions was an important starting point for USU and Bank Mandiri and provided enormous benefits in producing superior human resources.

“Right now the world is experiencing a huge disruption. For that we have to reduce the sizes that were bigger and more complicated to be simpler. MBKM is one way to overcome the gap between universities and the industrial world as well as an effort to combine theoretical and practical aspects,” Dr. Muryanto said.

Meanwhile, Agus Handaya said that the collaboration between USU and Bank Mandiri is one of the media that allows the two institutions to work together to improve the quality of graduates so that they are in line with what is needed in the world of work.

“The human resources needed in this digital era are human resources whose mindset, knowledge and skills are relevant to the present and the future.

For that we need programs that support to achieve all these goals. Students should be given an early opportunity to find out more about the world of work, one of which is through Merdeka Learning, Merdeka Campus,” said Agus.

To facilitate these needs, continued Agus, Bank Mandiri has prepared programs that support the realization of all programs. One of the ways that Bank Mandiri has taken is to hold a selection of Special Regional Leadership Candidates (CPDK) in collaboration with the Universitas Sumatera Utara. In the final selection, it was reported that 15 USU students had successfully graduated.

“CPDK is a way from Bank Mandiri to give the opportunity to local youths to contribute in the development and to become the future leaders in Bank Mandiri. The result will be re-evaluated whether the implementation is conducted well. Bank Mandiri is hoping to get the best graduates from USU,” he said.

Agus liken that what Bank Mandiri has carried out is a small step however, in time it will be a milestone and brings changes for the better. (RJ/(©ULC)
