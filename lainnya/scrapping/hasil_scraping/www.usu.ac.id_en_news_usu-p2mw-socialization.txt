"We will design how to mentor students in the context of entrepreneurship. So that young entrepreneurs emerge who can develop businesses," explained Dr. Edy.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a socialization of the Student Entrepreneurship Development Program (P2MW) at the USU level for 2024. The meeting occurred at the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto FEB USU Auditorium on Thursday (02/29/2024).

P2MW is a business development program for students who already have businesses through development and mentoring funding assistance by providing mentoring and business training to P2MW student participants. Last year, USU succeeded in passing seven USU student SME groups to get funding from Belmawa Kemendikbudristek.

Seeing the potential of USU students, the Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs of USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., said that a scheme for developing student entrepreneurship has been planned, supported by collaboration with the USU Research and Innovation Agency (BPRI) and the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations.

"We will design how to mentor students in the context of entrepreneurship. So that young entrepreneurs emerge who can develop businesses," explained Dr. Edy.

Through this activity, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A. hopes that students will get not only theory but also practical insights that can help them face challenges in the business world so that USU can improve the quality of graduates who are not only superior in academics but also have an entrepreneurial spirit.

"I hope students consistently learn and follow the direction of their mentors. So that the time they use is not wasted and can open up new job opportunities," hoped Dr. Edy.

Secretary of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations (DITMAWALUMNI) USU, Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi. explained that after the socialization event, students will receive mentoring so they can submit their projects to the Ministry System. The hope is that this year will involve more student teams that will compete at the national level.

"Students will be mentored until the competition level reaches the national level," said Rahma.

Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi. added that the mentoring will cover various aspects, including product uniqueness strategies, packaging, and product trade permits. With this mentoring, students can prepare well and compete optimally nationally.

"Our target is for one of the teams this year to get a gold medal in the national competition," Rahma said optimistically.
