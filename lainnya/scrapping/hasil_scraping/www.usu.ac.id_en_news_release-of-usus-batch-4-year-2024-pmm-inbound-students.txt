This program is a very important part of the experience for you to dare to leave your home city, and 5 months is a short time for us, and we hope this brings lessons for the exchange students currently at USU," said the USU PMM Coordinator.

USU PR — Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) bid farewell to 189 Inbound PMM Batch 4 Students for the Year 2024 USU Even Semester of Academic Year 2023/2024. This event took place at the USU Auditorium on Saturday, (Jun. 22, 2024).

In his speech, Mahatir Muhammad, S. Farm., M. Si., Apt., as the USU PMM Coordinator, said that PMM is an important opportunity for students coming from outside the region to get to know diversity better, despite having a relatively short duration of 5 months.

"This program is a very important part of the experience for you to dare to leave your home city, and 5 months is a short time for us, and we hope this brings lessons for the exchange students currently at USU," said the USU PMM Coordinator.

The Field Supervisor, Dr. Muhammad Taufik, S.Si., M.Si., with high enthusiasm, hoped that the exchange students at USU would be able to provide positive contributions to society in the future.

"I hope all exchange students at USU will convey good things, remember the good things that have happened at USU, and please forgive if there were any mistakes," said the Field Supervisor of USU PMM Students.

The Secretary of USU DPP, Dr. Joiverdia Arifiyanto, S.H., M.H. expressed gratitude to the 189 students who have chosen USU as a place to study and hoped they would take all the good experiences during the PMM 4 activities.

Lastly, the deputy chief of the Inbound PMM Batch 4 Students Year 2024 Universitas Sumatera Utara Even Semester Academic Year 2023/2024, Filyal Azzahra, thanked Universitas Sumatera Utara for giving them the opportunity to get to know diversity.
