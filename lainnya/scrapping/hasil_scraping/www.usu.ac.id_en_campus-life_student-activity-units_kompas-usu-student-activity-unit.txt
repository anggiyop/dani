About KOMPAS USU Student Activity Unit

KOMPAS USU is one of the organizations established at USU on October 6, 1980. As one of the oldest organizations, KOMPAS USU is always active in implementing its planned activities, ranging from mountain expeditions in Indonesia, organizing recycling competitions, to tree planting in the upstream area of the Deli River. KOMPAS USU is a university-level student organization engaged in outdoor adventures, nature lovers, and environmental studies. For students who are interested and enjoy a direct connection with nature, joining KOMPAS USU is the right choice. To this day, KOMPAS USU will continue to spread its benefits and make it the best organization for nature-loving students.
