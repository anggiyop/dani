"These students will also participate in activities that support the SDGs," she said.

USU PR — Participating in the International Sustainable Development Programs (SDGs) Competition, the Directorate of Student Achievements and Alumni Relations of Universitas Sumatera Utara (DITMAWALUMNI USU) held the Selection of USU SDGs Ambassadors at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) USU Hall on Wednesday (Apr. 24, 2024).

 

This event was a collaboration between DITMAWALUMNI USU, the Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships of USU, and the USU SDGs Center.

 

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation of USU, stated that understanding of the SDGs needs to be socialized, especially within the campus environment. Therefore, the USU SDGs Ambassadors will participate in the International SDGs Competition and engage in activities that support the SDGs.

 

"These students will also participate in activities that support the SDGs," she said.

 

Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi., as the Director of DITMAWALUMNI USU, mentioned that there were two stages of selection. The first stage involved 20 participants who underwent English language competency tests, psychological tests, and SDGs understanding assessments. In the second stage, 10 successful participants from the first stage presented their writings related to the SDGs. From these presentations, the top 3 participants will be selected to undergo training as USU SDGs Ambassadors.

 

"We have two stages of selection. In the initial stage, there are English language competency tests, knowledge about the SDGs, and psychological tests," she explained.

 

Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., Psychologist and head of Public Relations, Promotion, and Protocol, who served as a judge in this event, stated that besides having quality knowledge, the participants' demeanor and personality would also be evaluated. This is because the USU SDGs Ambassadors will represent the university at the national and international levels.

 

"So their appearance will also be considered because they will represent USU nationally or internationally," she said.

 

Indonesia is one of the countries that promotes and contributes to the SDGs. Dr. Wahyu Ario Pratomo SE., M.Ec., Secretary of the Priority Program Evaluation Agency, who also served as a judge in this event, expressed the hope that the USU SDGs Ambassadors would be of high quality and actively promote the SDGs to young people, contributing to development. He added that there is a directive from the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) for every state university to select SDGs Ambassadors.

 

"This is also a directive from BAPPENAS that every state university has one SDGs Ambassador, who will represent USU and Indonesia in international competitions," he said.
