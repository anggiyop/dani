Let's all support USN Kolaka in becoming an integrated and quality PTN-BLU and improving local and international progress," said the USU’s Vice Rector I in an interview

USU PR– Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) assisted Universitas Sembilanbelas November (USN) Kolaka in implementing Revitalization Towards State Higher Education - Public Service Agency (PTN-BLU) at the IMT-GT Room, USU Central Administration Bureau Building, Thursday (Mar. 14)

Vice Rector I for Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., in his speech, said that there are several important aspects discussed through this discussion, namely governance, finance, policies, education, learning, Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM), and quality assurance.

The assistance has been ongoing since signing the cooperation agreement between the Rector of USU and the Rector of USN Kolaka last January. USU facilitates all aspects of strengthening from PTN-Satker to PTN-BLU so that there will be an improvement for USN Kolaka.

USU’s Vice Rector I hopes that the transition from PTN-Satker to PTN-BLU is a sign of recognition and a step towards creating an inclusive, responsive, and sustainable higher education system. It also increases independence in managing resources, developing potential, and opening up wider opportunities for innovation, research, and community service.

"Let's all support USN Kolaka in becoming an integrated and quality PTN-BLU and improving local and international progress," said WR I USU in an interview.

The Rector of USN Kolaka, Dr. H. Nur Ihsan HL, M.Hum., said that USU was trusted to assist USN Kolaka. Lecturers from USN Kolaka will be assigned to USU in the Focus Group Discussion forum. Hopefully, the status can be increased from PTN-Satker to PTN-BLU in a short time.

"We have very high expectations, and we believe USU can assist USN Kolaka in achieving PTN-BLU status," added the Rector of USN Kolaka.

The cooperation initiation will not stop there, but in the future, USU and USN Kolaka will continue to collaborate in various ways to improve the quality of the university.
