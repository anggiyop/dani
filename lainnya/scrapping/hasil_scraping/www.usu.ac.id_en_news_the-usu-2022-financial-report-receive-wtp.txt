We are appreciative that this WTP acquisition has stayed the same since last year. The Rector states that USU continuously follows financial management standards under applicable rules.

USU PR: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Financial Management Report got an Unqualified Opinion (WTP). The predicate is awarded to institutions that adhere to acceptable financial accounting standards.

Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Soc., M.Si., USU Rector, stated that the acquisition of the USU Financial WTP Opinion in 2022 is USU's obligation to the community in terms of financial management.

"We are grateful that this WTP acquisition has not changed from the prior year. This signifies that USU continuously follows financial management standards under applicable rules," remarked the Rector.

The Rector also expressed his appreciation for the efforts of all lecturers and education professionals (Tendik) who continue to assist USU's rule-compliant financial management initiatives.

Secretary of the USU Board of Trustees (MWA), Prof. Dr. Guslihan Dasatjipta, Sp. A (K) praised the performance of the USU Rector and his team in obtaining WTP for the USU Financial Report for the 2022 Financial Year.

"This achievement conforms with the results of the assessment of the Public Accounting Firm (KAP) Kanaka Puradiredja, Suhartono (Nexia KPS) at the MWA conference. Of course, KAP, in delivering an opinion, also gives ideas for USU management to make it even better in the future," he said.

The MWA hopes that the Rector and all his employees can swiftly follow up on the recommendations given by KAP.

The Assessment Team from KAP Kanaka Puradiredja, Suhartono, described the USU 2022 financial report assessment system, which ensures that the financial statements are presented fairly, without material misstatement, and in accordance with the principles of Financial Accounting Standards through the application of audit programs.

"Nevertheless, we recommend some things, including the recording of fixed assets that need to utilize a new system and be able to compute depreciation in detail. Use an integrated system and continually improve coordination, communication, and cooperation, "he stated.

Chairperson of the USU MWA Audit Committee, Drs. Ardian, MM, CFE, QIA, CA, said that now USU employs a system from the ministry, namely SIMAK BMN.

"The application now needs upgrading so that the recording and depreciation of USU's fixed asset values can be more detailed, transparent, and efficient," he said.

Drs. Ardian also admired USU's financial success concerning the university's financial surplus and the substantial rise in fixed assets.

"This accomplishment should be commended, and in the future, we will simply need to integrate the systems we have created next year," he stated. (Bambang Riyanto)
