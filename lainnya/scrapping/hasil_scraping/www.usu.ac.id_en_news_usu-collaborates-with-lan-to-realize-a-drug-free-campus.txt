"A variety of activities will be designed so that USU is free from drugs," said Muryanto.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) cooperates with the Anti-Narcotics Institute (LAN) of North Sumatra Province to create a drug-free campus. Various forms of protection will be prepared in the form of academic to non-academic activities. This was discussed in a meeting between the USU Rector and LAN at the USU Rector's Office House on Thursday (11/11/2021).

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said that his party will strengthen protection. "A variety of activities will be designed so that USU is free from drugs," he said.

The forms of protection that have been prepared include strengthening literacy for students. Not only that, non-academic activities will also be intensified, for example, such as events that will provide education concerning the dangers of drugs.

"Non-academic activities such as non-curricular activities that combat drugs will also be designed in a format," continued Muryanto.

Vice Chairman I LAN North Sumatera, Leonard Tampubolon said, LAN synergizes with all existing communities and stakeholders to focus on the P4GN program (Prevention, Eradication of Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking).

"LAN is ready to synergize with USU, together against this country's enemy called drugs, because these drugs are dangerous for the development of our generation," Leonardo said.

Leonardo hopes that all students will support the fight against drugs. “Students must have their own awareness that the use of narcotics is indeed dangerous. Let's raise students' awareness of drugs. They are not alone, the campus, the Rector and the LAN join the fight. We have to be strong and united," he said.

USU and LAN will hold the next meeting to discuss the details of the program to be implemented. (©ULC)
