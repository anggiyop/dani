“KTM is not only an identity, but also a form of pride as a USU student. Not only KTM, the almamater jacket is also a pride that you have as a USU student," said the Rector.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Student Identity Card (KTM) for new students for the 2021/2022 Academic Year was officially launched, at the Pancasila Building, Wednesday (12/1/2021). The KTM that was launched is not only an identity card for students but can also be used as a BNI ATM card and e-toll payment.

USU Rector Dr Muryanto Amin, S Sos., M.Si., at the symbolic handover of the KTM said the KTM that was launched was the result of USU's collaboration with BNI. This is a form of partnership that has been established and through this partnership is expected to have a positive impact on both parties.

“Bank BNI took the opportunity to partner with USU in terms of procuring KTM for students. I believe this form of cooperation provides win-win adventures, both parties get the benefit,” said the USU Rector.

The USU Rector emphasized that the KTM is not just identification; but more than that, the KTM is a form of pride as a USU student.

“KTM is not only an identity, but also a form of pride as a USU student. Not only KTM, the almamater jacket is also a pride that you have as a USU student," said the Rector.

Similar thing was also conveyed by the USU BNI Branch Manager, Iqzal Anwar, who said that his party greatly appreciated BNI's cooperation with USU in the procurement of this KTM. According to him, this is a momentum to explore more cooperation with USU.

"We really appreciate this collaboration. We hope that this collaboration will continue, so that USU and BNI can go further to achieve their vision and goals. I also hope that students can also use this KTM as well as possible," he said.

Present on the occasion were USU Deputy Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, deans, education staff, and students at USU.

Distribution of KTM for USU students will be held for the next 15 days. A total of 9,489 KTM will be distributed in stages. This is done while still implementing health protocols to prevent the spread of Covid-19. (©ULC)
