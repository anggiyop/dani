“This is an opportunity for students who have been studying in classrooms to be able to then practice their knowledge directly in the community,” explained VR 1.

Public Relations USU -  Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) officially dispatched 99 students from six faculties to take part in the Thematic Real Work Lecture (KKN-T) program in 2025 which will be held in various villages in Karo Regency, North Sumatra, as part of the implementation of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education. This release occurred on Thursday, (08/05/2025) at the USU Faculty of Nursing Hall.

 

In his speech, USU Vice Rector I, Prof. Dr. Edy Ikhsan SH, MA, emphasized that this KKNT is a golden opportunity for students to apply the knowledge they have learned in the classroom directly in the community. The Karo Regency Government has also accepted the presence of students in several villages with cultural and agricultural potential.

 

“This is an opportunity for students who have been studying in classrooms to practice their knowledge directly in the community,” explained VR 1.

 

In addition, VR 1 said the KKN-T program aligns with the Village Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focusing on three main pillars: village human resource development, socio-economic development, and village environmental development.

 

“The design is in line with the Village SDGs based on three pillars,” said VR 1.

 

The KKN-T program in 2025 was participated by 99 students from 6 faculties. The Faculty of Vocational Studies was the most prominent participant, with 27 students, followed by the Faculty of Humanities, with 26 students, the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, with 17 students, the Faculty of Psychology, with 11 students, the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, with 9 students, and the Faculty of Agriculture, with 9 students.

 

KKN-T Coordinator Dr. Zulfan S.S, M. Hum said there is no significant difference in the implementation of KKN-T this year. Still, the characteristic lies in the placement of students based on talents and competencies according to the background of the study program. This is in line with the theme “Building Villages with Talents,” which is in line with the characteristics of Karo Regency, which has great potential in agriculture and culture, including traditional villages worth developing as cultural villages.

 

“There is no significant difference; it's just that we do the placement in the spirit of the talent,” Zulfan explained.

 

The university has also thoroughly facilitated this departure, starting with coordination with the local government, accommodation, transportation, and BPJS protection for students. Hopefully, these students' presence can make a real contribution and leave a sustainable, positive impact on the local village community.
