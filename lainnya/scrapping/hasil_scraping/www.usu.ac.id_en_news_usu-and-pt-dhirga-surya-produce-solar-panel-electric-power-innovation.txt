"The project at PT Dhirga Surya for solar panels, we will design the business product," said the chancellor.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatra Utara (USU) collaborates with PT Dhirga Surya to produce studies and innovations, one of which is the study of electricity from solar panels and the Electrical Engineering Study Program.

The cooperation was stated in signing the MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) by the Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, Dean of the USU Faculty of Engineering Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T, M. Sc., IPM, and the President Director of PT. Dhirga Surya Sumut Isfan Fachruddin, S.E., M.SP.

The Rector of USU said the study could be useful, PT Dhirga Surya could use it to help farmers.

Talking about solar panels, according to the Rector, it is important to think about how they are developed in the business. "The project at PT Dhirga Surya for solar panels, we will design the business product," he said.

In addition, USU will also support the food station program by PT Dhirga Surya by synergizing with the USU Faculty of Agriculture and collaborating with the USU Research Institute and Community Service Institute.

According to Dr. Muryanto, this collaboration with PT Dhirga Surya is in line with USU's goal of becoming a socio-technopreneur university which requires USU to continue to innovate.

"For example, if there is something that can become a collaborative innovation network with USU, we need to discuss the opportunity in more detail," he said.

In line with this, the President Director of PT North Sumatra's Dhirga Surya Isfan Fachruddin, SE., M.SP said that PT Dhirga Surya had previously held discussions with USU Electrical Engineering on how to use renewable energy to reduce production costs.

“We are thinking about how to get unhusked paddy at a decent price and rice at an affordable price. The business plan that we have with fossil energy at this time, the production costs will still be high," he explained.

Isfan hopes that the study conducted with USU can be implemented to make PT Dhirga Surya a pilot for food security in North Sumatra.

“North Sumatra has potential, there is land, factories, then there is support from the government. Together with USU, and the experts in their fields, we hope that this program will be successful," Isfan hoped.
