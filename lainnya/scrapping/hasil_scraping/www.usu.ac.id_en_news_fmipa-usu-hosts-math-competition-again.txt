"Firstly, we want to achieve one of the national education goals: to educate and enlighten the nation by the fourth paragraph of the 1945 Constitution. In addition, we also want to fulfill one of the university's tri dharma, community service," said Gani.

USU PR—The Mathematics Science Competition (MSC) 2024, organized by the Mathematics Student Association (HMM) of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), is set to take place again. The event will be held at the Student Arena on Friday (May 18, 2024)

Gani Asbahari Tanjung, the committee chairman, stated that the purpose of the MSC is to educate and enlighten the nation with national education goals and to serve the community in line with the University's Tri Dharma.

"Firstly, we want to achieve one of the national education goals: to educate and enlighten the nation by the fourth paragraph of the 1945 Constitution. In addition, we also want to fulfill one of the university's tri dharma, community service," said Gani.

The offline MSC 2024 invites junior high and high school students to participate in Sumatera Utara. The main objective is to enhance the competition spirit and knowledge among students and introduce the major work programs of HMM FMIPA USU.

"Our personal goal is to introduce that HMM has a big program," said Gani.

MSC is an annual program that has been held since 2008 but was on hiatus in 2019 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, MSC took place in the form of a regular competition accompanied by entertainment such as singing and dancing. However, this year, Gani stated that the committee is introducing a new concept by including a talk show. The aim is to change the perception of mathematics so that this event is an olympiad and a fun learning platform. The talk show will feature Ripayandi David AJP, also known as Ripa AJP, as the guest star.

The event was attended by Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi., the Director of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations Directorate (DITMAWA) USU, Dr. Cut Fatima Zuhra, S.Si., M.Si., a representative from the Dean of FMIPA, and several important guests, such as a representative from the Governor of Sumatera Utara, Ir. Abdul Haris Lubis M.Si., a representative from the Mayor of Medan, Mansyur Syah S.Sos. MAP., and the main sponsor of the event, Pimpinan Cabang Pegadaian Padang Bulan, Ibu Fauziah Husna Ginting.

Gani expressed high hopes that the participants would have a competitive and learning spirit.

"We hope is that the participants will not only return home without disappointment but also bring valuable knowledge back with them," said Gani.

MSC 2024 is expected to be a momentum to improve the quality of education in Sumatera Utara and strengthen the competitive spirit among the younger generation.
