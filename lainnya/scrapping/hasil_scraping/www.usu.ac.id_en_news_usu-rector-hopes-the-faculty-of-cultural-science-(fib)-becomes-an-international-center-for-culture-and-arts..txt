The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si hopes that the Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) will become a faculty that can internationalize, especially in the arts and culture.

This hope was conveyed by the Rector during a working visit to USU FIB, Wednesday (23/6) accompanied by Vice Rector I Dr Edy Ikhsan, Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa, Vice Rector IV Prof. Opim and Vice Rector V Luhut Sihombing, MP.

During his working visit to FIB, Dr. Mury highlighted the problem of facilities that need to be addressed."FIB is a faculty that will receive a lot of infrastructure improvements," he said.

This must be done, he added, because FIB has tremendous potential to support the internationalization of USU which is currently part of USU's Strategic Plan Phase 2.

“This faculty has many advantages that must be maximized.The existing study programs generally have an international network, so they must be supported by universities,” he said.

Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan agreed with the rector's opinion, so that assistance and improvement of infrastructure at FIB needed to be accelerated."I also see that many have doctoral degrees, so they must be supported to get professors," he said.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan also hopes that there will be more creative spaces at FIB, such as a performance room for performance arts."Students' idea and creativity must be accommodated so they are not wild, this is our collective duty," he said.

Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy on that occasion also appreciated the bilingual FIB website."This must be maintained and can be an example for other faculties," he said.

According to Dr. Poppy, the development of a website or official website is important in order to reach international students.

The Dean of FIB USU, Dr. T Thyrhaya Zein, thanked the Rector and the vice rectors for the visit.Shehopes that the support from the university will be able to make FIB even better.

"We will certainly support priority programs from the rectory ranks and this visit will certainly have a positive impact so that our shortcomings and weaknesses can be immediately seen and solutions are sought," she said.

Dr. Thyrhaya who was accompanied by Deputy Dean I Prof. Mauly Purba, Deputy Dean II Heristina Dewi, MPd and Deputy Dean III Mohd Pujiono, PhD emphasized that the deans at FIB would continue improving their performance, particularly encouraging study programs to establish international cooperation.

“We, of course, hope the best for FIB and USU.The spirit of USU, which is currently one of the internationally recognized universities, must be used as a momentum for improvement in all lines.God willing, we will work together to materialize the Rector's work program," she said.

During a visit to FIB, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin together with the vice rectors had the opportunity to visit the Ethnomusicology Laboratory which contains a recording room and traditional and modern musical instruments.The condition of the laboratory still needs a lot of improvement and it becomes a note from the Vice Rector V for assets to immediately make improvements.
