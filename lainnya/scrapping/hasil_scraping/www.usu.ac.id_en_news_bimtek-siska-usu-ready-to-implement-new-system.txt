"Besides, of course, it will function to summarize the administrative flow, the procurement of decision letters, and of course, there are new features for the uniformity of this SISKA," said Prof. Fidel

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) carried out Technical Guidance (Bimtek) for Making Decrees with the use of the Decree Information System (SISKA) for university employees. This guidance was held in the Academic Senate Room Friday (07/28/2023).

SISKA is a new system that will be implemented at USU regarding the mechanism for the birth of decision letters. The technical system used is not much different from the E-Office system that was previously established. Structurally, SISKA is under the auspices of the Administrative Office, which is one of the sections of the university secretariat.

Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked (OG), Sp. OG (K)-Fer as the USU secretary said that this socialization has been carried out since the 2021 leadership period.

“I think since the leadership of this period, Mr. Rector, starting in 2021, we have prepared the system and, of course, the e-officer that I conveyed,” explained Prof. Fidel.

Prof. Fidel said that SISKA serves to summarize the administrative flow of procurement of decision letters, and SISKA is uniform.

“Besides, of course, it will function to summarize the administrative flow, procurement of decision letters, and of course, there are new features for the uniformity of this SISKA,” said Prof. Fidel.

He also expressed his hope that this socialization could provide technical knowledge to help Human Resources (HR) in using SISKA later.

“So it is intended that today's socialization will provide technical knowledge to guide our HR using the decision information system later,” said Prof. Fidel.
