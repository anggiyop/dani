"Participating in an international-scale activity is part of USU's commitment to become the world's top campus. The 7th World One Health Congress is a prestigious event involving high-level campuses, so USU's participation in this activity is very good to increase our reputation," the Rector mentioned

USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is increasingly strengthening its position in the international education arena. Recently, USU participated in the 7th World One Health Congress at the Sands Expo & Convention Center, Singapore, represented by USU's Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Dr. Inke Nadia Diniyanti Lubis, M.Ked.Ped), Sp.A, Ph.D.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, appreciated the involvement of the Deputy Dean of the USU Faculty of Medicine who gave a presentation at this international event. According to him, this participation will help increase USU's brand awareness in the international community.

"Participating in an international-scale activity is part of USU's commitment to become the world's top campus. The 7th World One Health Congress is a prestigious event involving high-level campuses, so USU's participation in this activity is very good to increase our reputation," the Rector mentioned

The Rector hopes that in the future international scale activities can be improved. Internationalization is USU's focus in the next five years, so USU must continue to race to continue to be the best in all fields, including in the health sector.

Deputy Dean III of USU's Faculty of Medicine, dr. Land conversion has the potential to increase the transmission of malaria from animals to humans in Southeast Asia.

"Patterns of land use change by humans, including agricultural expansion and deforestation, are suspected to be the main drivers behind the relatively new and ongoing spread of zoonotic malaria (from animals to humans) in Southeast Asia," he emphasized.

Doctor Inke himself concluded this after working with the USU FK Team to conduct research on the Plasmodium Knowlesi Parasite among Palm Oil Plantation Workers in Langkat, North Sumatra, in July-August 2022 by collaborating with the Menzies School of Health Research Australia.

Plasmodium knowlesi is a parasite that causes malaria, which naturally infects long-tailed macaques and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes from the Anopheleline group.

In his research, Dr. Inke found that oil palm plantation workers in Langkat District often saw long-tailed macaques but ignored protection against mosquitoes which have the potential to transmit the plasmodium knowlesi parasite which causes malaria. Malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi is known to have been endemic in Sabah and Sarawak, Malaysia, since 2004. (©ULC)
