The international conference was organized by the Faculty of Medicine, Royal College of Medicine Perak, and took place from February 27-29, 2024. The conference's theme was "Health and Diseases: The Integration of Physiological Instruments and Molecular Technique." The conference was held in collaboration with Universitas Sumatera Utara and was attended by nearly 250 participants from various universities worldwide.

The conference recognized research that directly or indirectly contributes to advancing medicine and healthcare management, disease research, drug discovery, and disease management, groups working on instruments for better research and patient management, and technologists and engineers working to improve our medical care tools. The ICIPMM Organizing Chair, Prof. Noorzaid bin Muhamad, attended the event.

The presentation on the SPIRIT Project was delivered by Prof. Dr. dr. Dina Keumala Sari, M. Gizi., Sp GK(K). The presentation highlighted the goals of the SPIRIT Project, which are to increase physical activity and provide appropriate clinical nutrition to prevent non-communicable diseases. The project focuses on young people and aims to prevent various diseases such as obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other non-communicable diseases.

The SPIRIT Project involves several universities from European countries, including the University of Nicosia (Cyprus), the University of Lisbon (Portugal), and the University of Politecnica de Valencia (Spain). Asian universities involved in the project are ISBR Business School (India), Lovely Professional University (India), Bharati Vidyapeeth, deemed to be a University (India), University of Peradeniya (Sri Lanka), Sabaragamuwa University (Sri Lanka), Universitas Sumatera Utara (Indonesia), Institut Pertanian Bogor (Indonesia), and Universitas Syah Kuala (Indonesia).

The sustainability of the SPIRIT Project will be maintained through the development of the SPIRIT Club, which will metamorphose into the Global SPIRIT Club Network (GSCN). The GSCN will be established in each country to develop the SPIRIT Project, ensuring that the three-year project delivers results that support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the prevention of non-communicable diseases.
