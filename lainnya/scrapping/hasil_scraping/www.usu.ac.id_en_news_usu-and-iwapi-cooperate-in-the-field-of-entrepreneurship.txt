The head of IWAPI Medan, Ade Mora Nasution, invited USU students to take part in activities related to youth so that their potential and skills can increase. IWAPI also invites female students who have an entrepreneurial spirit to join IWAPI.

PR USU - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has collaborated in the field of entrepreneurship with the Indonesian Women Entrepreneurs Association (IWAPI) Medan. This was revealed when IWAPI had an audience with the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, Tuesday (5/10/2021).

At the meeting, the Chair of IWAPI Medan Ade Mora Nasution invited USU students to participate in activities related to youth so that their potential and skills could increase. IWAPI also invites female students who have an entrepreneurial spirit to join IWAPI.

“Nowadays, many young people have engaged in the business world, such as the creative industry or MSMEs. We want to develop students at IWAPI together to become strong entrepreneurs. The hope is that the young people at USU can be great and develop their business,” said Ade Mora Nasution.

Accompanied by the Rector's Expert Staff for Cooperation and Downstreaming of Research Products, Siti Salmiah drg., Sp.KGA, the Rector said, USU and IWAPI could work together in the Tri Dharma of Higher Education, namely service, research and development. IWAPI can be a partner in conducting research to help mass produce products.

"We also have research results, for example cosmetics, we need an industry that can manage the research results into products," said the Rector.

While in service activities, USU lecturers and students can do community service at IWAPI, so that members get knowledge from academics.

"We will place IWAPI in one of the institutions in the research institute or community service agency so that it becomes a partner," he added.

The Rector also said that there are two forms of cooperation that can be carried out. First, IWAPI members who successfully develop their business can become practicing lecturers. USU will implement a project-based learning process, where students will be divided into several groups to discuss business ideas.

Students will finalize their ideas accompanied by practicing lecturers. The Rector said that currently USU has established such cooperation, with GO-JEK, Grab and Paragon who have made modules for entrepreneurship courses.

Second, IWAPI can join to build existing businesses at USU, such as Inter Coffee or a flower nursery that is being designed at the Faculty of Agriculture.

With this collaboration, the Rector hopes that women can be more active in building the business world. "We can see that most of the entrepreneurs in SMEs and start-ups are mostly women. Hopefully with IWAPI it can run well," he added. (©ULC)
