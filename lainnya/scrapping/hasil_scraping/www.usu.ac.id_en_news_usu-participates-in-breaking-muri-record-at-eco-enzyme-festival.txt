This festival is a crucial agenda in the effort to break the Indonesian Museum of Records (MURI) record for the "Most Eco Enzyme Liquid Poured by Universities in Indonesia" category. This activity is part of a series of national events culminating on Aug. 17, 2024, coinciding with Indonesia's Independence Day.

USU PR — Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) once again demonstrated its commitment to environmental sustainability through the Green Campus Campaign as part of the "Eco Enzyme Festival 2024." The event took place at the USU Library Pond on Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2024.

 

This festival is a crucial agenda in the effort to break the Indonesian Museum of Records (MURI) record for the "Most Eco Enzyme Liquid Poured by Universities in Indonesia" category. This activity is part of a series of national events culminating on Aug. 17, 2024, coinciding with Indonesia's Independence Day.

 

In his remarks, the Head of the USU Green Campus Team, Dr. Eng. Ir. Hafizhul Khair AM, ST, MT, explained that USU contributed by donating 1,000 liters of eco enzyme derived from the processing of organic waste on campus.

 

"In addition to USU, we also carry out similar activities in other locations, including the USU Faculty of Agriculture," he said.

 

Dr. Hafizhul highlighted that this activity also involved the active participation of new students as part of the implementation of environmental safety material. The involvement of new students is expected to increase their awareness of the importance of environmental preservation from an early age.

 

"They are invited to be directly involved in improving the environment at USU," explained Dr. Hafizhul.

 

Eco Enzyme liquid has various functions, not only to improve water quality but also as an environmentally friendly natural cleaning alternative. Dr. Hafizhul also added that this activity is not only taking place on the USU campus but also in various other locations as part of efforts to improve water quality in the area.

 

"This eco enzyme can be used not only for water bodies but also for other purposes such as a substitute for floor cleaner or stubborn stain remover," he added.

 

Dr. Hafizhul hopes that this activity will not only have a positive impact on the environment but also create a comfortable campus environment that supports the teaching and learning process as well as research, while also showcasing USU as an environmentally friendly campus.

 

"Hopefully, we can be seen as an environmentally friendly USU and actively participate in protecting the surrounding environment," said Dr. Hafizhul.
