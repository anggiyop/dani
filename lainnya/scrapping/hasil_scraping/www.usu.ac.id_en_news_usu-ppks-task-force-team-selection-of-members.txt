Chairman of the PPKS Task Force Selection Committee Prof. Dr. Ritha F. Dalimunthe SE., M.Sc., said the PPKS Task Force was formed with the aim of handling and preventing sexual violence within USU. In addition, the PPKS task force will develop guidelines on how to handle and prevent this from happening.

The Selection Team for the Task Force for the Prevention and Handling of Sexual Violence (PPKS) at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a selection and determination of the Task Force for the Prevention and Handling of Sexual Violence (PPKS) within USU. The activity took place in the Academic Senate Room of the USU Central Administration Building on Monday, (08/29).

The activity is in the form of a test, namely a task force exam after previously the participants including lecturers, students, and educators participated in the file selection.

Prof. Dr. Erika Revida MS, who is also the selection committee, said that later there will be socialization conducted by the PPKS task force to the campus environment in each faculty. So that it can reduce the occurrence of harassment both between lecturers and lecturers, lecturers and students, and others.

"Obviously it is the handling and prevention of sexual violence on the USU campus, besides that they will also prepare guidelines or SOP on how to handle and prevent sexual violence and how to report to the chancellor of their activities at least every 6 months," said Prof. Erika.

There are 5 people who have been assigned to the PPKS task force based on the high scores achieved, including 3 students, 1 lecturer, and 1staff. (©ULC)
