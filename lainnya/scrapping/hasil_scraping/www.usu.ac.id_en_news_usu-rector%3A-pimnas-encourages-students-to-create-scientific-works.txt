According to the Rector, PIMNAS is a trigger to encourage collaboration between lecturers and students to create scientific works. USU will continue to improve PKM so that it can have an impact in the form of solutions to problems in the community.

USU PR - In order to spread the spirit of innovation, USU 34th PIMNAS held a Talkshow in a series of poster exhibitions that took place at the Pancasila building on Thursday (10/28/2021). The Talk-show presenting USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, Acting Head of Puspresnas Asep Sukmayadi, S.IP, M.Si and Chairman of the PIMNAS 34 Jury Prof. Dr. Ir. Nuni Gofar, M.S.

The Rector of USU explained that the campus is not only for learning in class but also for honing talents, especially for students to channel their creativity.

“The talk show and poster exhibition show that the students' talents are shown to many people and become solutions. This is the starting point to get inspiration,” the Rector said.

According to the Rector, PIMNAS is a trigger that encourages collaboration between lecturers and students to create scientific works. USU will continue to improve PKM so that it can have an impact in the form of solutions to problems in the community.

On the same occasion, Acting Head of Puspresnas Asep Sukmayadi, S.IP, M.Si explained about the competitions at the national level. "High school students who will enter college, as well as students in the first semester, after participating in this talk show, hope to have the enthusiasm to take part in PIMNAS later," Asep hoped.

Asep also appreciated the USU Rector for displaying a proud display of his work. “Here we can see part of the exploration of our students' superior resources. Among these works, there will be works that appear to be solutions to societal problems,” he continued.

Chairman of the Jury, Prof. Dr. Ir. Nuni Gofar, shares tips on how to make Student Creative Week (PKM) work. According to him, to develop creativity and generate creative ideas, you have to explore, read, and see the problems around you.

He gave an example of one field, namely Entrepreneurship PKM. “For example, if you want to join PKM Entrepreneurship, it doesn't mean you want to make food and then sell it immediately. In PKM, you have to see what the market needs. Then you make products the market and society needs,” Nuni explained.

The talk show participants are first-semester students and high school students in the city of Medan. They heard about the importance of innovation and achievement through scientific activities such as PIMNAS.(©ULC)
