USU PR — The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., attended a Breaking the Fast event with USU's journalist partners. This event served to strengthen the bonds of brotherhood between USU and the journalists, held at Interlokal Restaurant on Thursday (Apr. 4, 2024).

During the event, the Rector engaged in discussions with the journalists regarding the progress that USU will make in the future. The Rector stated that USU is preparing for internationalization programs by improving the quality standards of the curriculum, facilities, and human resources (HR) within the institution.

The preparations also include collaborative research between USU faculty and faculty from international campuses. Curriculum changes are being made to align with international accreditation standards to enhance the experience for foreign students studying at USU.

"Now, what we are doing is modifying the curriculum to make it more ideal. Alhamdulillah, the curriculum modification process is almost 100% complete," he said.

Furthermore, the Rector mentioned that USU has collaborated extensively with international campuses such as UiTM and Babson College. Through the Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) program, 17 campuses have been targeted for USU students.

"In Malaysia, with UiTM, and then we have already sent our students who have received IISMA to 17 campuses," he said.

Finally, alumni play a crucial role in the internationalization process as they help identify the whereabouts of alumni after graduation, aiming to improve the quality of education at USU.
