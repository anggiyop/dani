About Buddhis USU Student Activity Unit

Buddhis USU Student Activity Unit was established in 1992 with a foundation of camaraderie in its management. As a religious-based organization, Buddhis USU Student Activity Unit assists Buddhist students at USU in gathering, planning, and organizing religious events. Participating in this organization is also a way to strengthen faith and expand religious knowledge. For Buddhist students at USU who are interested, further information can be found on the Buddhis USU Student Activity Unit webpage.
