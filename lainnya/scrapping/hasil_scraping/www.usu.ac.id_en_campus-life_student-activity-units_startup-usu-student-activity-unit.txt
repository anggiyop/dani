About Startup USU Student Activity Unit

Startup Smart Generation Community USU, commonly known as SGC USU, is an active organization involved in various fields. This student organization expands its reach by carrying out community service, fostering entrepreneurship, and even sharpening the skills of its members to participate in Pilmapres (Selection of Outstanding Students). Many members of SGC USU are high-achieving students in their respective faculties. SGC USU has also gained achievement in the PHP2D (Holistic Village Development and Empowerment Program), which has enabled them to market their processed products actively. This student activity unit regularly opens its recruitment process to accept new members each year, with specific requirements such as being a Muslim student from any faculty at USU and demonstrating a commitment to organizational involvement and achievements. For Muslim students at USU seeking a platform for personal development and opportunities to participate in national and international competitions, SGC USU offers its support.
