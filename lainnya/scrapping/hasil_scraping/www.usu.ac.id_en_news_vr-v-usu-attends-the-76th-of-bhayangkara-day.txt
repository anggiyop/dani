In his mandate, the President congratulated and appreciated the hard work of the Police in serving the people and defending the nation and state.

PR USU – Vice-Rector V for Asset Management and Business, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Ir. Luhut Sihombing, MP attended the 76th Commemoration of Bhayangkara. The ceremony took place virtually at the North Sumatra Police Field. President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo ruled as an inspector at the Semarang Police Academy on Tuesday, (05/07/2022).

In his mandate, the President congratulated and appreciated the hard work of the Police in serving the people and defending the nation and state.

On the same occasion, the Head of the North Sumatra Regional Police, Inspector General of Police RZ Panca Putra Simanjuntak, apologized for the lack of maximum service provided by Bhayangkara to the community.

"Although the level and expectations of the community are quite high, there are still people's expectations that we have not been able to fulfill," said Inspector General Panca Simanjuntak.

In addition, he appealed to the public to continue to put their trust in the Police and their ranks to be able to provide the best service to the community. It is related to the Precision program promoted by the National Police that the National Police will create a Police that is predictive in responding to public expectations and complaints, responsive, transparent, and justice.

"Believe that the National Police will continue to improve the services. Through a precise police program, the National Police will continue to create a predictive Police that responds quickly to every hope and complaint from the public asking for public services," he said.

Responding to this, VR V USU said that there was progress in functions and responsibilities even though there was still unfinished work, therefore the participation of the community was needed to cover the shortcomings that the Police had not been able to fulfill.

He hopes that the Police can be precise in all internal and external actions.

"In the future, we need community participation to cover these gaps," said Ir. Luhut.

As additional information, there were performances in the form of the Sihutur Sanggul dance presented by students from Papua and prayer readings performed by every religious leader in North Sumatra.
