"Why did it drop? Because those who passed the SNBT exam are not allowed to register for the independent exam, there is a decrease automatically," explained The USU Rector.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held its 2024 Independent Student Selection (SMM) exam on Wednesday and Thursday, July 17-18, 2024. The exam was held at 16 locations within the USU campus with 5,396 participants.

 

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said the number of SMM participants this year had decreased compared to the previous year, which reached around 6,000. This decrease is due to a new regulation prohibiting participants who have passed the National Test-Based Selection (SNBT) from registering for an independent exam.

 

"Why did it drop? Because those who passed the SNBT exam are not allowed to register for the independent exam, there is a decrease automatically," explained the USU rector.

 

The rector said the policy exists to allow prospective new students who have not passed to compete again.

 

"If successful SNBT applicants re-register, it significantly reduces the opportunities for those who haven't passed yet," the rector remarked.

 

This year's independent examination program has a total capacity of 2,891 participants. The program is divided into three levels: S-1 (bachelor's degree) with 2,692 participants, D-4 (diploma 4) with 109 participants, and D-3 (diploma 3) with 90 participants.

 

Independent exam participants can choose a minimum of one S-1 or vocational study program and a maximum of four study programs, with a maximum of two S-1 and two vocational study programs.

 

Furthermore, the USU rector said that the Single Tuition Fee (UKT) for new independent pathway students is the same as for regular pathway students, the only difference being the Institutional Development Fee (IPI) according to level. However, prospective new students can still appeal.

 

"So if there are those who can't afford it, they can just submit letters for tuition relief," said the rector.

 

Lastly, the rector expressed hope that the independent selection examination will proceed as planned through tomorrow, allowing all participants to achieve their desired outcomes.
