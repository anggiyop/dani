USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: University of North Sumatra (USU) is an institution that has the responsibility to educate the community at the local, national and international levels. Currently, USU is concerned with improving performance in the international field, especially in the corridor of implementation of the Independent Learning - Independent Campus (MBKM) program.

USU Chancellor, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., stated this during the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between USU and the Muamalat Institute, which took place online, Thursday (7/15/2021).

"We thank and welcome this cooperation agreement to be able to synergize with each other in the concept of Independent Learning-Independent Campus (MBKM). It is currently difficult for university graduates to quickly adapt to the industrial world, so, it is hoped that through this collaboration we could gain experience sharing with the Muamalat Institute. Both in the banking sector or other business opportunities that can be utilized properly," the Chancellor said.

The Executive Director of the Muamalat Institute, Anton Hendrianto, agreed with the words of the USU Chancellor while reminding him that universities are currently competing to improve their quality especially with the current condition of Indonesia's Human Capital Index which is currently moving from the middle to the bottom.

"We are all concerned about the result. Moreover, by looking at the achievements of Vietnam which shot to 2nd rank under Singapore, so, the synergy between USU and the Muamalat Institute is one of the efforts to improve the quality of education. We must race against time so that we can optimize the potential demographic bonus that we will reap in the next 8-10 years. With the addition of 70-80 percents of the demographic bonus of productive age, it could mean that one of two things, blessing or disaster. This is a first step, a small step to start Indonesia's big step so that it becomes a developed nation not only left behind as a mere slogan," he explained.

Also, attending was USU Vice Chancellor III, Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., USU Vice Rector III’s Expert Staff, Siti Salmiah, drg., Sp. KGA, Head of HCGA, Finance and Operation Muamalat Institute, Nur Atikah, Head of CRM, Yudi Krisdianto, Head of Product Design, Saiful Khoiri, Product Development, Salsabila Sholehah, Client Relationship Manager, Marita P., and Head of BP2KM Bureau and USU Cooperation, Surya Darma, S.Sos.
