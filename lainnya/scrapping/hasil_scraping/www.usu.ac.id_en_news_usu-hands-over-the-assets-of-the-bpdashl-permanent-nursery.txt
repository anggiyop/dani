"We are proposing the development of the Kwala Bekala Campus through a grant to BAPENAS. The total we are targeting is IDR 1.7 trillion. We are worried that if there will be a positive response from the grant funds, we are afraid that the land being managed by Balai will have to be cleared, "explained Muryanto Amin.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received the handover of the permanent nursery, which has been managed by the Wampu Sei Ular Watershed and Forest Management Center (BPDASHL) in the Kwala Bekala Area.

The handover was held on Friday (18/3/2022) at the USU Central Administration Bureau, Medan.

Present at the meeting representing USU, Rector Dr Muryanto Amin, S Sos, M Si, Vice Rector V Ir Luhut Sihombing, MP, Dean of the Faculty of Forestry Dr. Rudi Hartono, S.Hut., M.Sc., Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana, M.S., Expert Staff, and lecturers. While representing BPDASHL, Joko Widiyanto, S.Hut, MP and their entourage were present.

"We hope that the activities we have carried out so far can be useful. We are grateful that since 2012 we can carry out the management of seedlings. This doesn't mean it's over, but we are targeting other forms of cooperation," said the USU Chancellor.

The Rector of USU appreciated the cooperation that had been carried out so far. As is known, USU has collaborated with BPDASHL for approximately 10 years since 2012. The partnership will be completed in 2022, so BPDASHL will hand over assets.

The Rector hopes for a renewal of cooperation with BPDASHL in other forms, such as short-term cooperation with different scope. It is in line with USU, which is currently preparing the Kwala Bekala area.

"We are proposing the development of the Kwala Bekala Campus through a grant to BAPENAS. The total we are targeting is IDR 1.7 trillion. We are worried that if there will be a positive response from the grant funds, we are afraid that the land being managed by Balai will have to be cleared, "explained Muryanto Amin.

He also explained that USU has also prepared a 50-hectare oil palm display case and an arboretum. To implement the plan, USU also communicates with GAPKI.

“For a decade, at least millions of seedlings and thousands of hectares have been rehabilitated from the seeds we produce. Almost every year it becomes a location for students and other schools to gain knowledge about nurseries from the beginning until they become seeds that are ready to be planted," said Joko Widyanto on occasion.

Joko Widiyanto, on that occasion also appreciated the cooperation that had been carried out so far. So far, it has carried out a lot of development in the area. All assets used in the development will be handed over to USU for management.

"Furthermore, we will hand over all assets to USU. We hope that this nursery can continue and thrive in the hands of the USU. Hopefully more useful. Because taking care of these seeds is like taking care of your children. It took 3-6 months to do it," he explained.
