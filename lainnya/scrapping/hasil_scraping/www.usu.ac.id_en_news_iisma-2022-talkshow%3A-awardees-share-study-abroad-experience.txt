WR I said that through this IISMA sharing session, it is hoped that all students will also get a clear picture of the lecture system and adaptation process abroad.

USU PR - Vice Rector I of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H, M.A congratulated five students who had succeeded in getting the opportunity to enjoy the system and atmosphere of studying at well-known campuses abroad.

This was conveyed at the Bold To Go Abroad Talkshow: Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) 2022, through a zoom meeting Tuesday (08/02/2022). The event itself shared information from the IISMA Awardees about requirements, procedures, and tips that are passed and done to seize the same opportunities that they have had.

The five IISMA Awardees students are Threesna Sharfina who studied at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK; Holongi TL Sitorus studying at the University of Pecs, Hungary; Alyssa Nadia who studied at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Ruth CP Sianipar who studied at the University of Lumerick and Arafah Nur Ihza who studied at the University of Leicester, England.

VR I said that through this IISMA sharing session, it is hoped that all students will also get a clear picture of the lecture system and adaptation process abroad.

"This opportunity is an attractive offer for those of you who are interested in getting the same opportunity and continuing their education abroad at state expense," he said.

WR I appreciates this sharing session as one of USU's efforts to contribute to development, namely by contributing to creating more excellent generations of the nation, who will realize the 2045 Golden Indonesia later.

"Today's and future young generations from Generation Z and Generation Alpha must be able to represent the nation's superior generation who are adaptive, competitive, creative, and innovative," he continued.

He hopes that more of USU's best students will get the same opportunities and opportunities in this year's IISMA selection.

"Today's biggest challenge is how USU students, as young people with great strengths, can use these strengths to overcome all difficulties and manage ideas that give birth to important innovations," he explained.
