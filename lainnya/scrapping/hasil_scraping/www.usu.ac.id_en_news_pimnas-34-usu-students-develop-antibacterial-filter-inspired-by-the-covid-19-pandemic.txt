"Given the critical need for masks, we created a mask filter using nanofibers. After reviewing journals, we discovered that this could be done in the lab. The filter we developed has antibacterial properties," she said.

USU PR – A team of students from Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has developed an antibacterial filter for masks using banana stem waste. Their research, titled “Effectiveness of Cellulose Acetate Nanofiber from Banana Stem Waste (Musa paradisiaca L.) as Antibacterial Filter for Masks”, was presented at the 34th National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS) on Wednesday, October 27, 2021.

The team comprises Sylvia Romalia Simanungkalit (Team Leader), Putri Amelia Sihotang, Shofi Tasa Al-Khairi, and Dzul Hadi Sahputra from the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA), and Brian Christoper from the Faculty of Dentistry. Their research was also showcased in poster form as part of the PIMNAS exhibition.

Sylvia explained that the research stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic, during which masks became a necessity for the public. However, many available masks do not meet the standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO).

"Given the critical need for masks, we created a mask filter using nanofibers. After reviewing journals, we discovered that this could be done in the lab. The filter we developed has antibacterial properties," she said.

Nanofiber filters are effective in enhancing mask filtration, as their small size enables them to block bacteria more efficiently. The team chose banana stems as the nanofiber source due to their antibacterial compounds, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, phenols, and saponins. Additionally, banana stems have a high cellulose content of about 63% and are easily accessible, particularly pisang barangan, a banana species endemic to North Sumatra.

"While there have been studies on similar products, few have utilized banana stems. This innovation demonstrates that banana stems can be effectively used in producing nanofibers," Sylvia stated.

The team conducted screening, contact angle tests, and product application trials. They hope the antibacterial mask filter can be developed further and benefit society.

During the PIMNAS presentation, the judges encouraged further testing of the product, particularly airflow testing using specialized equipment.

Sylvia expressed her gratitude to USU for their extensive support and preparation leading up to PIMNAS. The university provided monitoring, evaluations, and mentoring sessions with experienced faculty.

"We were thoroughly prepared with guidance on poster design and presentation skills. USU has done so much to support us. We hope to bring home a medal and make USU proud," Sylvia said.
