A new year is a new hope. Everyone enters the beginning of the year always with new enthusiasm and resolutions, hoping that the new year will bring more goodness and grace than the previous year. 2022, the year with the dominance of the beautiful number 2, will hopefully also bring beauty, blessings, and peace, just as all humanity hopes.
