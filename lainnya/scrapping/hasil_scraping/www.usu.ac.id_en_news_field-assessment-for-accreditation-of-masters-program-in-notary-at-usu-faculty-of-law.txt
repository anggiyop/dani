“With 394 students and 2,965 alumni, this program is one of the most popular. With 13 professors, 54 permanent lecturers with doctoral qualifications, seven lecturers, and four head lecturers, I am confident that the Master’s Program in Notary will fulfill its important roles and missions,” said USU Vice Rector IV.
