"We hope that these 120 PPDS students will really and truly learn. We hope that in the context of external quality assurance system accreditation to maintain the study period, “said Vice Rector I.

USU PR - The Faculty of Medicine (FK) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) handed over new students of the Specialist Doctor Education Program (Sp-1) and Subspecialist Doctor (Sp-2) for the February 2024 period. There are 120 new PPDS students consisting of 113 for Sp1 and 7 for Sp2. This reception was held in the 3rd floor hall of FK USU, on Wednesday (31/01/2024).

At the handover of PPDS, FK USU conducted a socialization on the Prevention of Plagiarism hosted by Dr. dr. Cut Adeya Adelia, Sp. OG (K) and also the socialization of Prevention of Bullying and Sexual Harassment in the PPDS FK USU Environment presented by Prof. Dr.dr Elmeida Effendy M.Ked., Sp.KJ (K).

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, USU Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, warmly welcomed and expressed his appreciation to the students who had passed. Vice Rector I also advised the students to continue learning and maintain their studies.

“We hope that these 120 PPDS students will really and truly learn. We hope that in the context of external quality assurance system accreditation to maintain the study period,” said Vice Rector I.

Dean of FK USU, Prof. Dr. dr. Aldy Syafrudin Rambe, Sp.S (K), said that new PPDS students are part of the academic community who must maintain the dignity of the Faculty. In this case, etiquette must be prioritized over science during the education period.

“Etiquette first, then science. Civilized people can be taught but people who have no manners the higher the knowledge the more dangerous it is, not beneficial to others, “said Prof. Aldy.

Vice Dean I of FK USU, Dr. dr. Delyuzar, M.Ked (PA), Sp.PA (K), said that the Faculty of Medicine has created a system and channel for students who can later report sexual violence and bullying.

“From the University to the Faculty of Medicine, we have indeed prepared all systems so that bullying and circumstances that interfere with the process do not occur,” he said.
