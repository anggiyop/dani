Mangrove branch briquettes provide an eco-friendly fuel source while preserving mangrove ecosystems. This innovation has the potential to reduce fossil fuel dependency and become a high-value export product.

In mangrove ecosystems, small branches growing along the coastline are often overlooked. However, these wood pieces can be processed into environmentally friendly alternative fuel. Imagine if the energy source in your home came from mangrove branches instead of the main trunk. This would create cleaner, more sustainable energy while preserving the ecosystem.

Amid global challenges in finding renewable energy sources, researchers from Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN)—namely Hardiansyah Tambunan, Arif Nuryawan, Apri Heri Iswanto, Iwan Risnasari, Prof. Mohammad Basyuni, and Widya Fatriasari—have developed a solution utilizing local natural resources. By using branches from three mangrove species—Bruguiera sexangula (upriver orange mangrove), Excoecaria agallocha (blind-your-eye mangrove), and Rhizophora apiculata (red mangrove)—their research has produced cylindrical wood briquettes measuring 3 x 4 cm.

Through innovative research, they processed branches from these three abundant mangrove species along the coast of North Sumatra into wood briquettes. This process not only offers an efficient fuel source but also helps preserve mangrove forests, which play a vital role in coastal protection and carbon absorption. Furthermore, they used natural, easily available adhesives to bind the wood particles into solid briquettes.

“The results of this research are quite impressive. In testing, briquettes made from Bruguiera sexangula with potato starch adhesive demonstrated the best quality. These briquettes are denser, have higher fixed carbon content, and produce greater heat,” said Hardiansyah.

The study revealed that the physical properties of the briquettes, such as moisture content, ash content, and calorific value, mostly met the standards of ISO 17225-3:2020 and Korea Forest Research Institute (KFRI) Grade A2. However, the briquette density did not meet these standards. Briquettes made from the upriver orange mangrove species generally showed better properties than those made from blind-your-eye mangrove and red mangrove, particularly when using potato starch adhesive.

The study also found that the interaction between mangrove wood species and the type of starch adhesive significantly affected certain briquette properties, such as moisture and ash content. However, it did not influence volatile matter content or calorific value. Briquettes with lower moisture content, such as those made from blind-your-eye mangrove with corn starch adhesive, are easier to ignite and have higher calorific values, which is crucial for fuel use.

Using mangrove branch briquettes provides an eco-friendly energy alternative that can be produced cheaply and easily. Additionally, utilizing mangrove branches for briquettes supports sustainable mangrove forest management while maintaining their ecological functions.

However, one unresolved challenge in this study is density. While the briquettes meet international standards for moisture content, ash content, and calorific value, their density remains below standard due to insufficient pressure during production.

“This remains a challenge for us researchers. By improving pressing techniques, we can further enhance briquette quality. This effort offers hope that mangrove wood briquettes can become a more efficient alternative energy source in the future,” added Hardiansyah.

Additionally, using mangrove branches as raw materials for briquettes offers ecological benefits. Instead of cutting down the main trunk, which can harm mangrove ecosystems, the sustainable use of trimmed branches helps preserve mangrove forests, which play a crucial role in shoreline protection and carbon storage.

Mangrove briquette innovation highlights the importance of renewable energy. With the abundant mangrove resources in Indonesia, utilizing local materials can reduce dependency on fossil fuels. If further developed, these briquettes could become high-value export products, boost the local economy, and contribute to environmental conservation.

With all its potential, mangrove branch briquettes are a small step that can have a big impact. In the era of climate change and energy crises, initiatives like this provide hope for a greener and more sustainable renewable energy future. In conclusion, further research is needed to optimize pressing techniques to enhance the density of mangrove wood briquettes.
