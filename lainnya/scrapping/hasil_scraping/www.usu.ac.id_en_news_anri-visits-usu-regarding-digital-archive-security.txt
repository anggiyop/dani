"We have coordinated with the USU Information System Center to develop a dynamic archival information system which will later be integrated with the e-office under the name e-archieve, but there are several obstacles that hinder it," Prof. Fidel said.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from the National Archives team of the Republic of Indonesia (ANRI) in order to carry out policy consultations related to Digital Archive Security Policy Development. This visit was held at the USU Archives Office on Wednesday (10/12/2022).

Universitas Sumatera Utara is currently developing a Dynamic Archive Information System which will be integrated with e-office under the name e-archives. Aside of that, the objective of this visit is to be able to consult directly regarding the filing system from the deputy and the team for information and development of the ANRI archive system.

Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Prof. Dr. dr. M. Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), SpOG(K) said that the USU Archives Office has coordinated with the USU Information System Center which is developing an archival information system. Despite the obstacles in development, USU continues to make updates in order to maintain USU's documents properly.

"We have coordinated with the USU Information System Center to develop a dynamic archival information system which will later be integrated with the e-office under the name e-archieve, but there are several obstacles that hinder it," the Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara mentioned.

Deputy for Information and Archival System Development ANRI Dr. Andi Kasman, SE., MM emphasized that in addition to having a friendly relationship, this visit was also aimed at carry out public policy consultations. It is hoped that in the future the policies that will come out will not only be on paper but also be implemented.

"Before we set a public policy, we need to ask stakeholders for advice so that later the policies we issue will not only be on paper but can be implemented in the field," he said.

The Head of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Archives Office Aisyah, SE., M.Si thanked the ANRI team for the third visit to USU. That way USU can directly provide advice in the formation of policies on securing digital archives. The USU Archives Office is also happy if the National Archives team of the Republic of Indonesia provides input for the improvement of the USU Archives Office in the future.

"Hopefully with a visit like this, we from universities can provide recommendations, suggestions, and also input for the formation of the best policies regarding digital archive security," he said. (©ULC)
