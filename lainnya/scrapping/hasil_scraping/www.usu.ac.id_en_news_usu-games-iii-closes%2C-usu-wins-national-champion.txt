USU as the host of the third USU Games in 2021 succeeded in achieving the overall title at the national level, namely in the pencak silat and chess sports with 3 gold, 1 silver and 1 bronze achievements.

USU PR - USU as the host of the third USU Games in 2021 managed to achieve the overall title at the national level, namely in the pencak silat and chess sports with 3 gold, 1 silver and 1 bronze achievements.

While at the local level, the Faculty of Law managed to become the overall champion with 2 gold and 2 silver. Followed by the Faculty of Economics and Business with 1 gold, 4 silver and 2 bronze achievements. The joint third overall winner was the Faculty of Cultural Sciences and Engineering with 1 gold, 1 silver and bronze medals.

In the closing ceremony of the USU Games on Friday (11/19/2021), the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., thanked all the participants who had competed and showed all their abilities, talents and best potential at this year's USU Games III.

The Rector hopes that the good results obtained on this occasion will not stop the participants from continuing to hone themselves and improve their achievements.

“Every time we live, of course, we must strive to get an increase in our quality, so that the potential does not stop at just one point. But it can continue to grow to achieve the best performance," he said.

Meanwhile, for participants who have not yet won the title, he advised to keep trying to improve their abilities.

According to him, the important essence of a competition, apart from achieving the best performance, is also to expand the network of friendship and cooperation with participants from various existing universities, in order to achieve more benefits for the nation and state.

Although held virtually, the USU Games were successful with 306 participants, consisting of 108 national participants, namely participants from universities outside USU and 198 local participants who were USU students.

The Rector appreciated and expressed his gratitude for all the work that had been done by the committee team who succeeded in successfully organizing the USU Games III well.

“Although this year all sports are still competed virtually, all activities are able to run smoothly. Of course, this is made possible by the enthusiasm of all elements of the committee who work with passion and responsibility," said the Rector. (©ULC)
