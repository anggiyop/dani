The collaboration will broaden our experience and knowledge. Working with external parties is one of the efforts to achieve USU's vision and mission," said Prof. Opim.

USU PR– Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from a delegation from The HEAD Foundation, which aimed to explore potential collaboration in the field of education but was later expanded to include health services. It took place in the Senate Academic Meeting Room on Rabu (Mar. 6)

The HEAD Foundation is part of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore. The HEAD Foundation is a non-profit organization that focuses on education, research, and health with a focus on Asia. The HEAD Foundation was founded by the Emeritus President of NTU, Prof Cham Tao Soon.

The Vice Rector for Information, Planning, and Development of USU, Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., welcomed the collaboration with the HEAD Foundation, especially in the medical field. The involvement of the HEAD Foundation, which focuses on the health sector, is expected to broaden USU's experience and knowledge.

"We hope that this meeting can open up opportunities for broader collaboration in the health sector or other forms of collaboration, which can be discussed more intensively on this occasion," said Prof. Opim.

Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., stated that the draft collaboration aligns with THF's vision of providing quality education and health services to improve Asian lives. As well as two important missions of USU: to produce graduates who become agents of change as drivers of modernization of society and to implement, develop, and improve educational programs, research culture, and community service.

"Our collaboration will broaden both our experience and knowledge. Working with external parties is one of the efforts to achieve USU's vision and mission," said Prof. Opim.

Prof. Cham Tao Soon explained some examples of cooperation programs they have implemented, such as traditional Chinese medicine; training health workers at Singapore General Hospital in MPC research, and knowledge sharing. In education, they have also worked on various projects and collaborations with various educational and health institutions in Indonesia.

"We are arranging this visit to look for opportunities to collaborate with USU in the future and also to get a better understanding," said Prof. Cham.
