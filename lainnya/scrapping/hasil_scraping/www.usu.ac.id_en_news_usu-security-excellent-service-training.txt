"We will carry out training for security continuously because it is related to our slogan "Transformation Towards The Ultimate, that's how we improve ultimate service," said Imam.

HUMAS - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held training on Excellent Service for Security Units at USU. Taking place in the Hall of the USU FISIP Multipurpose Building, the training invited Meizar Fuzia SE as a speaker on Tuesday (09/20/2022).

Secretary for Bureaucratic Reform Imam Bagus Sumantri S.Farm., M.Si, Apt said the training was aimed at improving the services provided by USU security units. The training was related to USU's slogan "Transformation Towards The Ultimate", so this training was attended by USU's security forces who became one of the frontlines to realize this slogan.

"We will carry out training for security continuously because it is related to our slogan "Transformation Towards The Ultimate, that's how we improve ultimate service," said Imam.

Responding to service standards, Imam Bagus Sumantri S.Farm., M.Si, Apt. mentions the service standards owned by the security forces follow the existing standards and will improve and assist the security process in providing services.

"We will see that service standards already exist, if they already exist, we will improve and assist the process in terms of making service standards, how a security person or security guard provides services to consumers," he explained.

With this training, the Secretary for Bureaucratic Reform hopes that the services provided by USU's security forces will go very well because they are a reflection of USU. According to Imam Bagus Sumantri S.Farm., M.Si, Apt., the excellent service provided by security reflects the service culture at USU.

"We hope that with this training process the services carried out by the security or security guards at USU can run very well because they are actually a reflection of USU," said the Secretary of RB.

On the same occasion, Meizar Fuzia SE explained several crucial points regarding service standards for a security guard, the first point was about greeting and navigating guests, then related to appearance standards.

"So in my opinion, the initial stage must be determined by service standards and appearance standards," said Meizar.

As additional information, later there will be several programs that will be carried out by the security unit at USU such as outbound and the main tasks of the security unit. (©ULC)
