“What USU has done as the host in the implementation of the 34th PIMNAS in a hybrid way is truly astonishing. The implementation is very neat, serving and full of surprises, are three things that will be remembered in the implementation of a large hybrid national event in Indonesia. The key lies in creativity, cooperation, quick and precise response and a very humble attitude to serve. This is a good way for implementing major activities held by USU in the future," Edy Ikhsan said.

MEDAN – USU PR: Successfully won 3 awards in the 34th PIMNAS 2021 with 1 bronze and 2 favorite awards, the host of the 34th PIMNAS, Universitas Sumatera Utara, is still happy because the implementation of the second hybrid PIMNAS at USU has received appreciation and response which was very satisfying from all the college contestants and the jury delegates who participated in the ranks of the Ministry of Education and Culture. The 34th PIMNAS participants gave two thumbs up for all the services provided by the 34th PIMNAS host, Universitas Sumatera Utara, in accommodating all the activities and stages of the competition that was held.

This was conveyed by the Chairperson of the 34th PIMNAS 2021 at USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, Saturday (10/30/2021), responding to the implementation of the 34th PIMNAS as a whole.

“What USU has done as the host in the implementation of the 34th PIMNAS in a hybrid way is truly astonishing. The implementation is very neat, serving and full of surprises, are three things that will be remembered in the implementation of a large hybrid national event in Indonesia. The key lies in creativity, cooperation, quick and precise response and a very humble attitude to serve. This is a good capital for the implementation of major activities held by USU in the future," Edy Ikhsan said.

He added that he as the General Chair of the 34th PIMNAS was grateful for the trust of the USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., and gave the committee the flexibility to express innovative ideas in the National Student Science Week.

“I also express my pride and gratitude to all the committees who have shown the style of USU which is very proud. USU received a very positive appreciation from the Jury, the Deputy Rector for Student Affairs involved and also the PIMNAS participants," said Edy, who also serves as USU Vice Rector I.

Although USU was in 33rd position out of 108 participants, in term of achievement, it was already the maximum result based on the preparations made so far. “This 34th PIMNAS moment will be used as a turning point to build a pattern of student development going forward. I congratulate the 7 groups of USU students who have made USU proud and thank you for the dedication of all students and supervisors," he concluded. (RJ/©ULC)
