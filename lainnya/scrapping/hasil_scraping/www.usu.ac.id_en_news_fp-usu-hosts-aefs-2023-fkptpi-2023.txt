We would like to express our gratitude for the USU Faculty of Agriculture(FP) appointment as host for the 2023 FKPTPI National Workshop," said Prof. Muryanto.

USU PR- The Faculty of Agriculture (FP) of the University of North Sumatra (USU) hosted the 7th International Conference on Agriculture, Environment and Food Security (AEFS) 2023 and the Communication Forum of Indonesian Agricultural Universities (FKPTPI) 2023. It was held in the Arya Duta Hotel Medan on Wednesday (26-27/09/2023).

The activity entitled 'Green Economy for Enhancing Food Security, Environmental and Agricultural Sustainability' brought in four speakers, namely Irda Safni, SP, MCP, Ph.D. from USU; Prof. Dr. Ir. Bustanul Arifin, M. Sc from Lampung University; Dr. Małgorzata Korzeniowska, Assoc. Prof. from the University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Poland; lastly, Prof. Anjas Asmara from Universiti Putra Malaysia.

USU Rector, Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M. Si., enthusiastically welcomed the arrival of the speakers and the deans and vice deans of agriculture from 67 universities throughout Indonesia who had attended this international conference.

"We would like to express our gratitude for the appointment of the USU Faculty of Agriculture as the host of the FKPTPI 2023 National Workshop," said Prof. Muryanto.

Furthermore, Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M. Si highlighted that agriculture is the key to answering big questions, such as how we will feed an increasing population, how we will deal with climate change, and how to ensure that agriculture remains an attractive profession for future generations.

"Agriculture today is not just about food production but also about sustainability, food safety, and environmental protection," said Prof. Muryanto.

Dean of FP USU, Dr. Ir. Tavi Supriana MS, stated that the target set by the Faculty of Agriculture is in line with the Rector's priority program to achieve the Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Lecturers can disseminate their research findings through this Conference to an international audience.

"With this achievement, every year it is proven that the Faculty of Agriculture can continue to contribute to increasing the number of articles published in quality international journals," explained Dr. Tavi.

Prof. Dr. Ir. Samanhudi, S.P., M.Si., IPM, ASEAN Eng, as Secretary General of FKPTPI, explained that the National Workshop organized by FKPTPI is an annual routine agenda, where the meeting aims to exchange experiences and use of technology from various regions with diverse backgrounds and agricultural problems.

"Apart from being a forum for sharing experiences, this meeting is also considered important in strengthening the organizational structure, especially considering that there will be a management change," explained Prof. Samanhudi.

Dr. Małgorzata Korzeniowska, Assoc. Prof. said that the main issues at this conference were agricultural sustainability and low food security. People certainly need healthy food. So, if we produce restorative plant materials, we will get food that improves the welfare of all.

"Of course, we need to protect our environment. Because the environment is the key to sustainable food production at every step of the way and for every generation," said Dr. Małgorzata.
