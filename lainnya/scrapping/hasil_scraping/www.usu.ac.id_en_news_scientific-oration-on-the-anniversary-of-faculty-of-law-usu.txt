Trained with the instinct of cooperation and collaboration, in the OBE curriculum, lecturers are no longer dominant in the classroom because knowledge can be obtained anywhere. The function of lecturers in the classroom has changed from teacher to mentor and facilitator, said Prof Mury.

HUMAS USU - The highlight of the 69th Anniversary Celebration of the Faculty of Law of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) was the scientific oration entitled Paradigm of Punishment for Corporate and Business Crimes delivered by the Director General of Legislation of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights (Kemenkumham), Prof. Dr. Asep Nana Mulyana, S.H., M.Hum. This event occurred at USU Faculty of Law Peradilan Semu Building on Saturday (11/03/2023).

USU Rector Prof. Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, who was present on the occasion, mentioned the transformation that the Faculty of Law USU must carry out. According to the Rector, Faculty of Law USU must implement an OBE-based curriculum and be able to produce graduates who are adaptive to the development of the outside world.

“Trained with the instinct of cooperation and collaboration, in the OBE curriculum, lecturers are no longer dominant in the classroom because knowledge can be obtained anywhere. The function of lecturers in the classroom has changed from teacher to mentor and facilitator,” said Prof Mury.

Prof Mury continued by saying there are always challenges and obstacles in change. He says change can be done easily if you turn challenges into opportunities.

“But if we turn those challenges into opportunities to strengthen us, to give us direction, and to give us benefits, especially since the advancement of IT makes it easier for us to design a programme, to monitor a result,” he added.

On the same occasion, the Dean of USU Faculty of Law, Dr Mahmul Siregar SH, M.Hum, said that this scientific oration was useful from an academic and legal point of view. Through this scientific oration, the audience, mostly students and alumni of the Faculty of Law USU, get new thoughts about the criminal law discussed.

“We hope that in terms of content, this scientific oration can provide a thought of law in Indonesia related to the issue of punishment, especially against corporations according to the current rules in Indonesia. That's what we expect from an academic perspective,” explained the Dean of the Faculty of Law USU.

In addition, the Dean of USU Faculty of Law also submitted his report on the development and achievements of USU Faculty of Law during 2022. He hopes that the community and all stakeholders can find out and provide input to improve the Faculty of Law USU.

In addition, after the scientific oration, the event continued with the inauguration of the Faculty of Law USU Podcast Room and the '92 International Class FH USU Student Room, which the USU Rector directly carried out.
