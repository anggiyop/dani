"With this collaboration, there will be many activities, both in the academic scope, general literacy and other activities that support the capacity and competence development of USU students and the academic community," said the Rector.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatra Utara (USU) cooperates with PT Telkom Indonesia to increase the quantity and quality of skilled and trained workers, especially in digital telecommunications and the like. This collaboration was confirmed by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by the Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. with the Digital Business Director of PT Telkom Indonesia, M. Fajrin Rasyid, Friday (21/01/2022).

This activity is also juxtaposed with a Public Lecture filled by speakers from the Director of Digital Business of PT Telkom Indonesia Persero (Tbk) within the framework of the Digistar Connect Goes to North Sumatra activity.

In his remarks, the Chancellor said that the talents at USU could further develop their digital technology capabilities and insights through a program that would be implemented with PT Telkom Indonesia. According to him, universities are currently faced with a digital ecosystem that cannot be avoided.

"With this collaboration, there will be many activities both in the academic scope, general literacy and other activities that support the capacity and competence development of USU students and the academic community," he said.

Dr. Muryanto added that digital talent still requires extraordinary efforts to be on par with other countries and participate in massive digital economic growth.

"Because of the disruption that has now entered our daily lives, we need digital talent who can make a positive contribution to a golden opportunity for Indonesia," he continued.

On the same occasion, the Director of Digital Business of PT Telkom Indonesia said cooperation with campuses is one of the targets to be achieved by PT Telkom Indonesia.

"We chose USU because USU is one of the largest campuses in Indonesia," he said.

Fajrin added there are several things that have been identified by his party, namely the information system on campus and increasing innovation so that it becomes a means to connect academics with industry.

"We hope that there will be concrete cooperation achieved in the field of innovation or information systems," he said.
