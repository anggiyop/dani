This is a good opportunity for all of us because the Taxation Supervisory Committee has been formed and inaugurated. The campus is chosen because it is a neutral place, which can convey complaints about our tax system," said Prof. Muryanto

HUMAS USU - The Tax Supervisory Committee (KOMWASJAK) held a "KOMWASJAK Listens", which was attended by the general public at the Multipurpose Hall of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), on Wednesday (10/05/2023).

At this socialisation, USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., welcomed KOMWASJAK Chairman Amien Sunaryadi, Ak., M. Pa. and Vice Chairman Dr. Zainal Arifin Mochtar, S.H., LL.M.

The Rector of USU said that this opportunity is good considering that the campus is the right place to provide counselling on taxes.

“This is a good opportunity for all of us because the Taxation Supervisory Committee has been formed and inaugurated. The campus is chosen because it is a neutral place, which can convey complaints about our tax system," said Prof. Muryanto.

Two things are highlighted in taxation—first, the objects subjected to tax, and then the negotiation when making tax payments.

The Rector of USU responded that by holding this meeting with KOMWASJAK, the public could understand the rules and procedures of taxation and highlight the behaviour of tax officials, which has an impact on the economy in society.

This socialisation has been carried out in various regions. Deputy Chairman of Komwasjak Dr Zainal Arifin Mochtar, S.H., LL.M., said that Komwasjak has accommodated and classified the inputs given by the public regarding taxes.

"We have done it in three regions; Surabaya, Jakarta, Makassar, and most recently, here. We have classified all the inputs. Some need to be handled immediately, some in the form of a quick reaction, while some need to be studied first," said the Deputy Chairman of Komwasjak.
