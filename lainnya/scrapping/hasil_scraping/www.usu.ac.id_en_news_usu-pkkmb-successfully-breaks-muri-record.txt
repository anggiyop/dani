"Step beyond the limit, starting with the intention and endeavor to achieve the best dream for the future. Never look down on or put limits on your abilities," said the Rector of USU.

The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the Opening of the Introduction to New Student Campus Life (PKKMB) 2022 offline for the first time in the last two years. The USU PKKMB itself will last for 3 consecutive days after it was officially opened at the USU Mini Stadium on (09/05/2022).

With the theme “Step Beyond Boundaries”, this time PKKMB also managed to break the record from the Indonesian World Record Museum (MURI) for the category of singing 8 ethnic songs which was attended by 7,858 participants. The 8 ethnic groups are Karo Batak, Melayu, Pakpak, Simalungun Batak, Nias, Toba Batak, Angkola Batak, and Mandailing. The MURI Charter was handed over by the MURI Customer Relations Manager, Lutvi Syah Pradana.

The Rector of USU Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that the theme is an interpretation of the invitation and motivation for new USU 2022 students as the nation's young generation to be brave and eager to achieve their goals by mobilizing all their abilities and will. It can be started with the intention and effort of fighting power.

"Step beyond the limit, starting with the intention and endeavor to achieve the best dream for the future. Never look down on or put limits on your abilities," said the Rector of USU.

The theme raised at the PKKMB is also in line with USU's tagline, Transformation Towards the Ultimate, which is expected to be a flame of enthusiasm for students to become the best learners, graduates, and alumni at the national and international levels.

The Rector said that USU students can learn not only from the perspective of the science they are engaged in but can also explore the wealth of other knowledge considering that USU is not only the oldest university outside Java but also as a comprehensive university with many faculties and study programs.

“Universitas Sumatera Utara is not only the oldest university outside Java but also a comprehensive university, the university with the most faculties and study programs. It means that you can not only learn from the scientific perspective you choose, but you can explore other wealth of knowledge,” said Muryanto Amin.

USU's Director of Student Achievement and Alumni, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE., M.Si who is also the Chair of the 2022 USU PKKMB explained, the theme "Step Beyond Boundaries" is a form of enthusiasm to invite new students to transform into individuals with character, creative, achievement, and talent STAR. in accordance with USU's core values.

Doli explained, after in 2019 USU managed to break the MURI record with the most participants doing Ahoy Gymnastics, this year USU again broke the MURI record in singing 8 ethnic North Sumatran songs with the most participants, which was followed by 7,858 new students. According to him, this was done by USU to play a role in preserving local wisdom.

“The MURI record is a manifestation of the largest university in Sumatra and number 1 in North Sumatra, which must contribute to preserving and displaying the local wisdom of North Sumatra. The 8 songs represent the 8 ethnic groups in North Sumatra," explained Doli.

In addition to breaking the MURI record, the PKKMB 2022 event was also enlivened by two famous comedians who are USU alumni, namely Priya Prayogha Pratama Tanjung alias Babe Cabita and Nugroho Achmad alias Lolox. The USU 2022 PKKMB activity can be well organized thanks to the collaboration and cooperation between USU and Bank Mandiri, Grab, BNI, Wardah, and Emina. (©ULC)
