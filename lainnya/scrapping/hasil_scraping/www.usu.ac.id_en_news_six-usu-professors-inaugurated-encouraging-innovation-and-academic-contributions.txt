“Every professor inaugurated today is a reflection of USU's academic quality. They are thinkers and researchers and inspire students and young academics to continue working,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

Public Relations USU—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) once again added to its best academics by inaugurating six professors from the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences and the Faculty of Agriculture. The inauguration ceremony, which took place at the USU Student Center on Monday (10/02/2025), was attended by the academic community and the extended families of the inaugurated professors.

 

The six inaugurated professors are Prof. Dr. Drs. Bengkel, M.Si; Prof. Dra. Dewi Kurniawati, M.Si, Ph.D; and Prof. Drs. Heri Kusmanto, M.A., Ph.D from the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences. Meanwhile, from the Faculty of Agriculture, Prof. Dr. Ir. Diana Chalil, M.Si., Ph.D; Prof. Dr. Ir. Lisa Mawarni, M.P; and Prof. Dr. Ir. Satia Negara Lubis, M.Ec was inaugurated.

 

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in his speech, emphasized that this inauguration is part of the university's efforts to improve its academic reputation nationally and globally. He said that USU continues to be committed to creating an innovative and collaborative academic environment that produces research and community service with a broad impact.

 

“Every professor inaugurated today is a reflection of USU's academic quality. They are thinkers and researchers and inspire students and young academics to continue working,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

On this occasion, the USU Rector also reminded us that the number of USU professors has now reached a proud number. In 2024, USU added 52 new professors, and from January to February 10, 2025, 12 new professors were inaugurated. This figure shows USU's consistency in encouraging the quality of higher education.

 

“USU strongly supports academics in developing their careers in their respective scientific fields,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

The USU Rector also highlighted the importance of collaboration in carrying out the Tri Dharma of Higher Education. The position of professor is not only the result of individual work but also collaboration with various parties to produce innovation and quality graduates. In addition, he emphasized that higher education has a strategic role in providing solutions to global problems that continue to grow.

 

The three main pillars in the Tri Dharma of Higher Education are major concerns: education, research, and community service. Education must be relevant to global needs and provide inclusive access for students. Research and community service must stem from research that can be applied to solve social problems.

 

One of the inaugurated professors, Prof. Dr. Drs. Bengkel, M.Si., from FISIP USU, highlighted the importance of regional policies in accommodating population mobility. He explained that the movement of people from minus areas to surplus areas is natural, but it needs to be balanced with regulations that ensure their welfare in the new place.

 

“Destination areas must be able to formulate policies that can integrate migrants so that they not only move but can also improve their quality of life,” said Prof. Bengkel.

 

Meanwhile, Prof. Dr. Ir. Satia Negara Lubis, M.Ec., from the Faculty of Agriculture, in his speech titled “From Garden to Cup”, emphasized the great potential of coffee commodities from the highlands of North Sumatra, such as Karo, Sidikalang, and Tarutung. He highlighted how coffee farmers can improve their welfare by understanding the difference in profit margins between selling cherry coffee and roast beans.

 

“Coffee farmers must realize that selling roast beans provides much greater added value than selling only green beans,” explained Prof. Satia Negara.
