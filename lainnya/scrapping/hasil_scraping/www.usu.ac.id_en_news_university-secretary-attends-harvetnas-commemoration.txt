Yes, at today's event, we are reminded that two generations in the Republic of Indonesia will continue the values of Patriotism and struggle described by the heroes, "said Prof. Fidel

HUMAS USU - Secretary of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked (OG), Sp. O.G, Subsp. F.E.R. attended the Ramah Tamah and Gathering with the Families of Pioneers and Freedom Fighters of the Republic of Indonesia (RI) of North Sumatra Province (North Sumatra) in the Tengku Rizal Nurdin Hall, North Sumatra Governor's Office House, on Friday (11/08/2023).

This event coincided with the National Veterans Day North Sumatra Level commemoration to welcome and enliven the 78th Indonesian Independence Day (HUT) by Presidential Decree (Keppres) Number 30 of 2014. National Veterans Day is set on August 10 to commemorate the armistice.

In the series of events, there was also a performance of illustrations of the Indonesian People's Struggle and the symbolic handover of compassion and gifts to the Families of Indonesian Independence Fighters.

The USU Secretary stated that through this event, the role of the predecessor and successor generations in Indonesia was reminded again. The younger generation, as successors, is mandated to continue the spirit of patriotism and the values inherited by the heroes of the independence of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI).

"Yes, at today's event, we are reminded that there are two generations in the Republic of Indonesia who will continue the values of Patriotism and struggle described by the heroes," said Prof. Fidel.

For this reason, the USU Secretary hopes that USU students can strengthen their learning to become a young generation ready to contribute to building a better and more beautiful NKRI and continue the legacy of the predecessors' values.

"Students at the Universitas Sumatera Utara must strive to continue the values of our predecessors so that one day they can become ready-made scholars to build the Republic of Indonesia," said Prof. Fidel.
