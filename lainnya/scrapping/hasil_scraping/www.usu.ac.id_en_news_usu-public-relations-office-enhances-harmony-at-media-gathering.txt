The outstanding achievements have been demonstrated by the Public Relations and Protocol team, which is notably under the university secretariat," stated Prof. Fidel.

USU PR - The Office of Public Relations, Promotion, and Protocol of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) organized a Media Gathering titled "Good Relation, Ultimate Reputation." The event took place at Hotel Pancur Gading on Wednesday (12/27/2023).

This Media Gathering is an effort by the USU Public Relations, Promotion, and Protocol Office to strengthen relations with media partners through events such as outbound activities, simultaneously enhancing the university's reputation in the eyes of the public. The event involved 30 media partners as invited guests, and nearly around 90% attended the event.

Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K)-Fer, the Secretary of USU, highlighted that the performance development of USU's Public Relations and Protocol can be observed through consistent improvements in each annual award from the Ministry. These improvements will undoubtedly contribute positively to USU's nationally and internationally ranking.

"The outstanding achievements have been demonstrated by the Public Relations and Protocol team, which is notably under the university secretariat," stated Prof. Fidel.

The USU Secretary hopes this event serves as a platform for continuous dialogue with journalists, as it opens up space for USU and journalists to exchange ideas and views from each side. In their professional capacity as journalists, this is expected to enhance the university's branding in the eyes of the public.

The Head of USU Public Relations, Promotion, and Protocol, Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., Psychologist, explained that the event aims to create a more harmonious atmosphere while appreciating the contributions and collaborations established with media partners. Thus, it can strengthen and reestablish the collaboration between media partners and USU.

"This event creates happiness and a sense of family between media partners and the USU Public Relations team. So that a more harmonious and close relationship can be built in the future," clarified Amelia.

Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., Psychologist, also highlighted significant progress, having previously achieved only a silver level and now reaching a gold level. The USU Public Relations team has received over ten awards this year. The latest achievement is the informative predicate in public information openness.

"This event is also a strategy to refresh the minds of friends who may be tired and stuck in monotonous routines," expressed Amelia.

With the success of this event, the closer collaboration between the Universitas Sumatera Utara and the mass media will positively impact the university's progress and provide useful information to the wider community.
