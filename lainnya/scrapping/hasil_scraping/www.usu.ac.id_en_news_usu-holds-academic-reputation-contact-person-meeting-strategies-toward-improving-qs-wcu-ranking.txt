“Our Academic Reputation score is currently still ranked 900 out of 1501 universities assessed. This is a big challenge for us to improve global perceptions of the quality of USU education and research,” said Prof. Poppy.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an Academic Reputation Contact Person Meeting to discuss strategies for improving Academic Reputation scores as part of the QS World Class University (WCU) ranking. This event took place in the Academic Senate Room 3rd Floor, on Tuesday (10/12/2024).

The meeting began with remarks from USU Vice Rector III, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt. who emphasized the importance of Academic Reputation, because it has a weight of 30% in QS WCU, as one of the crucial indicators.

“Our Academic Reputation score is currently still ranked 900 out of 1501 universities assessed. This is a big challenge for us to improve global perceptions of the quality of USU education and research,” he said.

The Vice Rector III of USU also conveyed the strategic steps that USU has taken, such as the implementation of guest lecture programs, webinars of leading scientists, and the appointment of adjunct professors. In addition, the International Mobility Staff and Sabbatical Leave programs for USU lecturers also encourage increased international networking.

“We must strengthen collaboration with globally reputable universities, increase publications in reputable journals, and encourage the involvement of the entire academic community to build the university's reputation,” he added.

In the next session, Prof. Rikson Asman Fertiles Siburian, S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D., as USU Internationalization Program Manager, gave a presentation on the role of international ranking agencies such as QS WCU.

“Universities that are included in this ranking are better known by foreign students and lecturers, thus opening up opportunities for global cooperation,” explained Prof. Rikson.

Prof. Rikson also highlighted the positive results of USU's research collaboration with international partners. According to him, USU's recognition at the global level has increased significantly through participation in various international expos, workshops, and programs.

“We have been recognized in various countries such as Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. This branding further strengthens USU's position as a university with international reputation,” he added.

In closing, Prof. Rikson expressed the hope that the entire USU academic community can commit together in efforts to improve academic reputation.

“We must focus, care, and work together to ensure USU is increasingly recognized internationally. Commitment from all elements of the university is the main key to achieving this target,” he said.
