"Participants in this vaccination are USU students and the general public with a minimum age of 12 years," said the Screening Coordinator, dr. Andike Aribi.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a second stage of Covid-19 vaccination at USU Pancasila Building from November 15 to November 24, 2021. This vaccination is the second dose after the first dose was carried out in September 2021.

"Participants in this vaccination are USU students and the general public with a minimum age of 12 years," said the Screening Coordinator, dr. Andike Aribi, Tuesday (11/16/2021).

He said this vaccination uses the Sinovac vaccine type and provides 20,000 doses of the vaccine.

"There are no special requirements to take part in this vaccination, participants who have registered on the website vaccination covid19.usu.ac.id just come with their identity," said dr. Andike.

dr. Andike added that after the vaccination, it is targeted that all USU students in semester 5 and above have all been vaccinated. "This is to welcome face-to-face lectures for even semesters," he continued.

One of the vaccination participants, Imam F, said that the implementation of the USU mass vaccination that he participated in went smoothly for both the first and second doses. "The presence of vaccinations on the USU campus makes it easy for students who want to carry out vaccines, all registration is made easier because it is online," the USU Political Science student said.

He added that the students had been waiting for the second vaccination. "Because in addition to maintaining the body's immune system, we can also be better prepared to lead a normal life, facilitate access to anywhere, because we need a permit through PeduliLindung which has been registered with the vaccine," Imam said.
