USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., supported USU's Ecumenical Christmas activities and advised that the USU Diaspora from abroad could be more involved, especially in expanding international networks. USU Public Relations – USU Oikumene Christmas which this year will be organized by the Faculty of Agriculture will be filled with various social service activities such as giving nine basic ingredients to orphanages, disabled homes or to markets.

Chairperson of the 2021 USU Oikumene Christmas Committee Prof. Dr. Ir. Noverita Sprinse Vinolina, MP, IPM during an audience with the USU Rector said social service activities were carried out by first collecting donations.

“We from the committee have collected donations and were followed by other members. In addition to social services, Christmas which will be held in a hybrid manner will also present USU Diaspora from various foreign countries," he said, Tuesday (11/2/2021).

He explained that the USU Diaspora would participate in online Christmas activities and present the liturgy. The Rector is expected by the committee to attend to give a speech and officially open the event.

"Social service activities will begin on November 20, 2021. After the Christmas event, the committee will also prepare for the Easter celebration which will be held in April 2022," he said.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., supported USU's Ecumenical Christmas activities and advised that the USU Diaspora from abroad could be more involved, especially in expanding international networks.

“The diaspora is good to be involved. Their involvement is important to expand USU's network at the international level and strengthen the perception of USU graduates to support the QS-Ranking," he said.

The Rector advised the USU Ecumenical Committee to record alumni, both at national and international levels, to support tracer studies. "Alumni that are recorded in particular are alumni who have worked at the manager level and above," he said.

The Rector will try to attend directly to the location of the Christmas celebration, especially for the USU Ecumenical Christmas celebration. However, if he doesn't have time, he will attend it virtually. The Rector also appreciated the social service activities that will be carried out because they are part of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education, especially in the field of community service.

Also accompanying the Rector in the hearing were USU Vice Rector V Ir Luhut Sihombing, MP along with the 2021 USU Oikumene Natal administrator. (©ULC)
