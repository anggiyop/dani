"Yesterday we passed the 4.0 era. we emphasize more competition and technology invasion. But we have entered the 5.0 era. Our era is critical, collaborating, because at our age, it's better if we collaborate by contributing all our potential to achieve a good goal," said Haris.

He said that he would approach elements in FISIP such as HMJ and UKM as one of the first steps in the plan to advance the government of FISIP.

“First, we approach the elements in FISIP, HMJ, UKM. We have just entered the activity. The important thing is the approach first," he explained.
