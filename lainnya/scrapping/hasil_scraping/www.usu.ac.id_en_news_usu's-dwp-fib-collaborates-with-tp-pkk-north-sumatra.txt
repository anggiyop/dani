“This positive collaboration will also encourage the progress of the faculty, especially in improving the main performance indicators (KPI). This gathering is expected to continue into concrete programs so as to create close collaboration between the faculties and the provincial government," said T. Thyrhaya Zein.

PR USU - Dharma Wanita Persatuan (DWP) Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the PKK Mobilizing Team (TP PKK) North Sumatra collaborated in carrying out Gathering events and National Education Day Presentations (Hardiknas).

The activity with the theme "The Role of Career Women in the Household" was carried out offline at the Prof. Multipurpose Building. H.T. Amin Ridwan, Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) USU on Friday (27/05/2022).

USU's FIB Dean Dr. T. Thyrhaya Zein, M.A., who opened the event explaining the relationship between TP PKK North Sumatra and DWP FIB USU is expected to be able to establish synergy in the Tri Dharma College program.

“This positive collaboration will also encourage the progress of the faculty, especially in improving the main performance indicators (KPI). This gathering is expected to continue into concrete programs so as to create close collaboration between the faculties and the provincial government," said T. Thyrhaya Zein.

The chairman of the USU FIB DWP, Taulia Pujiono, explained that the theme of the role of career women that was appointed was very suitable to be discussed within USU, especially at FIB, because many of the FIB DWP members had roles as housewives as well as career women. This activity can provide benefits and enthusiasm for women in the FIB environment.

"Not forgetting her role as a housewife, but still being able to be creative and explore her potential well," she said.

USU DWP representative Sri Rahayu Kartini Edi Ikhsan said that being a wife and mother who also works as a career woman often gets a dilemmatic position.

Demands for the implementation of proportional and balanced obligations for both are very high, both from family and people around. Balancing the two roles is certainly not an easy thing to implement in daily routines.

"Hopefully those of us who are in the position of these two roles get new motivation, which brings the positive energy and balance needed," he said.

The head of the North Sumatra PKK Mobilization Team (TP PKK), Nawal Edy Rahmayadi, said that with the freedom we now have, we should be grateful and remember for R.A Kartini's services for fighting for women's rights in the past.

That way, women can be free from the notion that women can only take care of housework and kitchen work.

According to TP PKK SUMUT, in this modern era women are lucky because they can be housewives as well as have careers outside the home and also make achievements that can make this country more advanced in the future.

"I hope that even though a wife has a career, she must maintain a balance between career and home. Especially in terms of educating children," he said.

Also attending the event, Deputy Dean II Dra. Heristina Dewi, MPd, Professor of FIB USU Prof. Hj. T. Silvana Sinar, M.A., Ph.D, the chairmen and secretaries of the study program and the Expert Staff of the Dean Dr. Dardanila, M. Hum, and other invited guests.
