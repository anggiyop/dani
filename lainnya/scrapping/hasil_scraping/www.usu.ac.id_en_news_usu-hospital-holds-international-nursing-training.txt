"At Singapore Health, there are already institutions that focus on innovation in the health sector that doctors and nurses occupy," said Hasmela.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Hospital and the USU Faculty of Nursing, in collaboration with the Temasek Foundation-Singapore Health Services Health Care, held an International Nursing Training entitled "Health Care Program in Technologies for Nursing Training and Practice" Towards Innovation in Nursing. This activity was held online at USU Hospital from January 24 - January 28, 2022.

The Chairperson of the Nursing Committee, Hasmela Revi, S.Kep., Ners, M.Kes said that the important points obtained from this training were about the medicine innovation institute.

"In Singapore Health, there are already institutions that focus on innovation in the health sector that doctors and nurses occupy," said Hasmela when interviewed on Thursday, (27/01/2022).

In addition, there is also material about nursing robotics, which is a robot that functions as a nursing assistant. At Singapore Health, this nursing robot is used to save nursing staff.

"Nursing robotic is able to provide various kinds of actions to help nurses," he said.

Hasmela admitted that USU Hospital was very open to the shared innovations, especially nursing robotics. According to him, this training needs to be carried out continuously. Therefore, USU Hospital will be given special guidance regarding the idea and application of the technology.

"We want to continue to receive guidance like this so that we can learn other technologies in nursing," he said.

Hasmela hopes that nurses from USU Hospital can create an innovation that will then be sent to Singapore Health to conduct studies and implement them directly.

"From this training, we got the idea; it turned out like this, so we want someone to do it and be guided directly there," he said.
