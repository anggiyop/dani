"Perhaps so far, many patients have been seeking treatment abroad, while in fact, the potential in North Sumatra itself is not inferior. That's why the mayor of our city initiated Medan medical tourism. Fortunately, thank God, USU Hospital is trusted as one of the hospitals involved in the program," said Dr. Yudha.

PR USU - Hospital of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) participated in the Medan Medical Tourism 2022 exhibition. The event was attended by 12 hospitals in Medan and took place on Thursday (30/06/2022). Medan Medical Tourism is a program initiated by the Mayor of Medan to promote the potential for medical treatment in North Sumatra Province.

The Head of the Hospital Medical Tourism Work Team, Dr. Yudha Sudewo, Sp.OGk said that USU Hospital supported the exhibition by being trusted as a hospital involved in this exhibition.

"Perhaps so far, many patients have been seeking treatment abroad, while in fact, the potential in North Sumatra itself is not inferior. That's why the mayor of our city initiated Medan medical tourism. Fortunately, thank God, USU Hospital is trusted as one of the hospitals involved in the program," saidDr. Yudha.

He also explained that this activity was aimed at promoting the services in the selected hospitals in this program. Later, these 12 hospitals will not only be covered by the Ministry of Health (Kemenkes) but also under the auspices of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenparekraf RI).

"So later this program, apart from us under the health minister and the tourism minister, will also promote this hospital," he said.

Yudha Sudewo hopes public trust in USU Hospital will increase because that belief is the most important.

"What we know now is that the public has started to trust USU Hospital with the increase in the number of our treatments, which is what we hope for in the future, and the community will trust us even more," he said.

General Director, HR, Assets, and Finance of Dr. Hospital. Gema Nazri Yanni dr., M.Ked. (Ped)., Sp.A thinks that this exhibition is a good activity, so she hopes that USU Hospital can help promote and introduce the services available at USU Hospital through this exhibition.

“Excellent activity. This is one of the activities that help promote the hospital to increase the number of patients who come and introduce what services are available at USU Hospital," said Dr. Gema.

As additional information, the Medan Medical Tourism exhibition coincided with the Apeksi exhibition that all mayors in western Indonesia attended.
