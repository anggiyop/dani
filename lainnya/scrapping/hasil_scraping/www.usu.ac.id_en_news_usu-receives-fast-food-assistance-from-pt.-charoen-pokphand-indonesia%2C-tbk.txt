USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) through its Teaching Hospital is one of the health facilities that serve Covid-19 patients. USU is committed to help the government to be able to handle patients exposed to Covid-19. The services provided range from isolation to treatment.

PT. Charoen Pokphand Indonesia, Tbk., as one of the companies engaged in the food sector took the initiative to participate in supporting USU's efforts in dealing with Covid-19 patients. Through Regional Head, Bambang Sutrasno, PT. Charoen Pokphand Indonesia, Tbk., symbolically handed over the aid in the lobby of the USU Central Administration Bureau, Wednesday (7/21/2021).

"On this occasion we handed over assistance in the form of ready-to-eat food intended for health workers at the USU Teaching Hospital. There are 720 packs of food that we distribute every week for two months," Bambang said.

USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., who received the assistance symbolically expressed his gratitude and appreciation for the assistance provided. He said, PT. Charoen Pokphand is a strategic partner of USU which has been running for some time.

“It is really a joy for the University of North Sumatra especially the University of North Sumatra Hospital which today has received assistance in the form of fast food from PT. Charoen Pokphand Indonesia, Tbk., which is intended for the medical team who work there daily to provide health services to the wider community," the USU Rector said.

He said the assistance provided was very meaningful for the USU Teaching Hospital. As has been known, the USU Teaching Hospital has participated in assisting the government in handling Covid-19 since the outbreak began.

“We all realize that the consumption of nutritious food is very much needed at this time to support the performance or improve the performance of the USU Hospital medical team. The medical service activities carried out during the Covid 19 pandemic which began about 1 year and 4 months ago, experienced a very drastic increase compared to health service activities before the pandemic," Muryanto said.

The Rector of USU also invited PT. Charoen Pokphand Indonesia, Tbk., to initiate and organize other collaborations. He mentioned that one of the programs that are ready to be worked on is the procurement of hygienic chicken coops to be used by the Animal Husbandry Study Program, USU's Faculty of Agriculture.
