The area of Kampung Nelayan Seberang, located in Belawan I Urban Village, Medan Belawan Subdistrict, is quite difficult to access by outsiders. To reach this village, it is not easy. We have to sail the sea using small motorboats that are often docked at the Belawan pier. This condition then resulted in Kampung Nelayan Seberang becoming an area that experienced a slowdown in infrastructure development and the economy of the community.
