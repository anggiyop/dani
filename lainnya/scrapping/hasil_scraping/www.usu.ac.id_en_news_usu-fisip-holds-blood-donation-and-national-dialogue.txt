"We really hope for these activities, especially at the Directorate of Student Achievement, that today's student movement is an ideological movement and an impact-based movement," said Doli Dalimunthe.

HUMAS - Student Administration (PEMA) Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) together with the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) Medan held a Donor FISIP activity consisting of national dialogue events and blood donation actions.

Invited the Deputy Governor of North Sumatra H. Musa Rajekshah, S.Sos. M.Hum as the Head of PMI Medan, represented by the Head of the Economic Bureau of the North Sumatra Provincial Government, Dr. Naslindo Sirait, the activity took place in the USU FISIP Hall and Hall on Friday (09/16/2022).

In his remarks, Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations of USU Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe, SE, M.Si said that the FISIP Donor activity was one of the extraordinary activities initiated by PEMA FISIP.

The Directorate of Student and Alumni Achievement strongly supports the activities carried out by the FISIP Pema. Because the student movement expected by DITMAWA ALUMNI is an activity in the form of an ideological and impact-based movement. The Director of Ditmawalumni believes that this activity has an impact, benefit, and blessing for many people.

"We really hope for these activities, especially at the Directorate of Student Achievement, that today's student movement is an ideological movement and an impact-based movement," said Doli Dalimunthe.

Doli Dalimunthe hopes that the activities carried out by FISIP PEMA can be carried out by all Pema at USU. Students are expected to be able to struggle, transform, evolve, and not take anarchic actions.

"I hope we transform to fight for evolution but not to commit anarchic acts," he said.

The Dean of USU's FISIP Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., MSP explained that the collaboration between USU's FISIP and the PMI Unit in Medan will be continued with the Nationality Talkshow. On a talk show that includes context about students and blood donation actions.

The Dean of FISIP said that now is the time to bleed to help people in need, not for a physical war against the invaders.

"So this talk show is both running for the position of students and the context in this activity, if students are not the era of physical war against the invaders, but now bleeding for people in need," explained Hatta Ridho.

Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., MSP expects the proliferation of positive activities from students both in terms of quantity and quality. These activities are expected not only to show themselves as students but at the same time understand the suffering of the people so as to motivate and participate in becoming people's mouthpieces.

“We want more positive activities, both in terms of quantity and quality. Not only to show we are students but also to motivate that there is a community that from the hope of the nation really understands what the people are suffering from," he explained.

USU FISIP Student Governor Aris Martondi Hasibuan explained that this FISIP Donor activity was a form of action taken by the FISIP Pema to commemorate PMI's anniversary on 17 September. So that through this activity, students can increase their sense of nationalism. (©ULC)
