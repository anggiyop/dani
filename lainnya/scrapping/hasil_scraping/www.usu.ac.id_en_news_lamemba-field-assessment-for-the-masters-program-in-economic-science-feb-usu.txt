USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that in terms of field assessment, there are aspects that can be learned beyond the assessment, such as sharing experiences. This includes taking aspirations and knowledge from the assessment team and also providing the latest information in USU's environment to improve the Tri Dharma of higher education.

USU PR - Lamemba (The Institute of Accreditation for Economics, Management, Business, and Accounting Programs) conducted an accreditation field assessment for the Master's Program in Economic Sciences at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). Inviting two Lamemba assessment teams, Prof. Dr. Taufiq Marwa, S.E., M.Si from Sriwijaya University as assessor I and Prof. Dr. Apridar, S.E., M.Si from Syiah Kuala University as assessor II. This activity was held at the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto FEB USU Hall on Wednesday (04/01/2023).

USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that in terms of field assessment, there are aspects that can be learned beyond the assessment, such as sharing experiences. This includes taking aspirations and knowledge from the assessment team and also providing the latest information in USU's environment to improve the Tri Dharma of higher education. Furthermore, there will be suggestions from the assessment team that can be implemented as changes to advance the Master's Program in Economic Sciences.

“Of course, in a document that is submitted, there must be shortcomings, and these shortcomings can be addressed for future improvement,” said the USU Rector.

The Dean of FEB USU, Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si, said that this accreditation activity is not only a symbol of assessment but also shows a commitment of the FEB USU academic community, especially the Master's program in Economic Sciences. With this commitment, the academic community of FEB USU has prepared and improved everything to achieve excellent accreditation.

“Because USU is currently in the 500 World Class University, therefore FEB strives to obtain excellent accreditation,” he concluded.

The Dean of FEB USU also said that the improvements in FEB USU are in accordance with the tag line created by the USU Rector, “Transformation Towards the Ultimate”, which is interpreted by continuously transforming and improving in FEB USU's environment. One form of improvement is by improving teaching staff, education, operations, and also services in FEB USU.

“USU has entered its second strategic plan; therefore, to achieve the existing targets, we will make improvements at all stages,” he stated.

One of the assessment team, Prof. Dr. Taufiq Marwa, S.E., M.Si, said that the related assessment is based on documents that have been submitted by the Master's of Communication Science, but if there are documents that have not been submitted but the original form of service can be demonstrated, this can be an addition to the accreditation score.

“I am sure that the Master's Program in Economic Sciences has not only conducted a field assessment once, but hopefully, this time, the results will satisfy the entire academic community of FEB USU,” he said.
