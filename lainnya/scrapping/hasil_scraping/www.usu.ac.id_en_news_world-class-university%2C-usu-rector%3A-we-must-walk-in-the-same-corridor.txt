USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: The efforts of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) to be included in the category of the world's leading campus in the World Class University (WCU) circle show increasing intensity. USU seeks to ground the plan to all work units in its environment. This is done so that all parties can be involved and actively participate.

USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., in his online remarks at the World Class University Workshop on Thursday (7/1/2021), emphasized that the contribution of all parties within USU is very important to achieve this goal.It takes cooperation and a common perception so that the efforts carried out are right on target.

“We need to move in the same corridor and the same perception.All heads of work units at USU must coordinate and work together to complete the set targets.We will be able to solve all the obstacles if we work together," the Rector of USU said.

He emphasized that the head of the work unit at USU had an important role in finalizing the indicators that were set.Therefore, he said that his party would conduct periodic evaluations to see the progress being made.

“I will do regular evaluations, be it weekly, monthly, or quarterly to see the work progress of all work unit leaders.The leadership of this work unit has a very big role to complete the existing indicators," he said.

The head of the work unit has the authority to make policies in the unit he leads.In addition, the head of the work unit is also entitled to submit plans and budgets to support its activities.

“I hope that the head of the work unit can maximize the existing budget.In July, the Budget Work Plan (RKA) will be revised, followed by August preparing the 2022 RKA. The head of the work unit must prioritize the budget for activities to fulfill WCU indicators, he said.

He explained that currently USU's opportunity is wide open to enter the ranks of the world's leading campuses.The various achievements and efforts that have been obtained so far have led and supported the improvement of USU's ranking among other leading campuses.

“USU has been eyed by university ranking agencies to be included in the ranks of world campuses.We are currently in 1201+ position for the first time in ranking by QS Ranking.This is certainly good, but we can't stop here," he explained.

Muryanto Amin has set a high target by making USU one of the 1000 best campuses according to the QS Ranking in 2023. Furthermore, he targets that in his fifth year as Rector, USU will be in the top500 campuses in the world.

“For this reason, the managerial aspect of each work unit leader is very much needed so that our efforts can produce results.In these five years we have to work hard and focus.Our focus is one, campus internationalization," heconcluded.

The online meeting was attended by USU Vice Rectors, Rector Expert Staff, USU Deans and Deputy Deans, USU WCU Ranking Team, USU lecturers and education staff.(RR/©ULC)
