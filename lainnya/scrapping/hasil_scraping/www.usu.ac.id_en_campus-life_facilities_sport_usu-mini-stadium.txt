USU Mini Stadium

The USU Mini Stadium is a facility Universitas Sumatera Utara provides to support the province's aspirations as a place where the best athletes are born. With a capacity of over 2,000 people, the mini stadium is located within the university area as a multifunctional unit that supports sports activities for both USU members and external participants. The USU Mini Stadium can serve as a training center for Medan's football teams and a venue for hosting major events, such as the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) and the Introduction to Campus Life for New Students (PKKMB) by USU.
