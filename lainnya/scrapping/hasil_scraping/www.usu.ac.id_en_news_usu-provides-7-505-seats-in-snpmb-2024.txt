USU is offering 49 undergraduate programs with a total capacity of 7,505 seats, which are divided into three admission tracks: SNBP (National Selection Based on Performance), SNBT (National Selection Based on Tests), and Mandiri (Independent).

USU PR – Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a socialization of the National Selection for New Student Admission (SNPMB) 2024 on Tuesday, (Jan. 16, 2024), at the USU Auditorium. School principals, teachers, guidance counselors, and students from Medan attended the event.

USU is offering 49 undergraduate programs with a total capacity of 7,505 seats, which are divided into three admission tracks: SNBP (National Selection Based on Performance), SNBT (National Selection Based on Tests), and Mandiri (Independent).

For the undergraduate applied program, USU will offer seven programs with a capacity of 635 seats, and the Diploma-4 and Diploma-3 programs will offer seven programs each with a capacity of 535 seats. Two programs in the PSDKU Nias Utara will also be available. This year, USU is allocating at least 20% of its capacity for the SNBP track and 40% for the SNBT track. More information on the student admission process can be found on the USU website.

The SNPMB socialization provided guidance and counseling to schools and 12th-grade students on the three admission tracks: SNBP, SNBT, and Mandiri.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., Vice Rector I for Academics, Student Affairs, and Alumni, said that USU also has an additional admission track, the SBPU (Selection Based on Outstanding Performance), which is open to students with academic and non-academic talents.

Dr. Ikhsan also said that each school should provide guidance, direction, and support to its students in choosing the appropriate faculty and major so that they can pass the selection process.

“The competition to get into university is quite tough, so don't just choose a program of study at random. Consider the number of available seats and the tightness of the program in previous years as a reference,” he explained.

Ikhsan Siregar, S.T., M.Eng., Head of the USU Priority Program Evaluation Agency, explained that the SNBT track is the most competitive selection process. He also advised students not to follow their friends and to be serious about their choices.

"In choosing a program of study, make sure it is what you are interested in. Don't just follow your friends, hear about a program of study that you like from your friends, or be forced by your parents," he said.

August Sinaga, S.Pd., S.S.T., M.A.P., Head of the Education Branch Office of Region I of the North Sumatra Provincial Government, said that the socialization was beneficial for school principals and guidance counselors to plan for the improvement and provision of learning services that are centered on the students and in accordance with the resources and human resources available in the educational institutions.

"Thank you, and my appreciation goes to the USU Rector, who continues to synergize and collaborate to build education in North Sumatra," he said.

As information, the National Selection Based on Achievement (SNBP) is currently undergoing its stages of the process. The stages began on December 28, 2023, with the School Quota Announcement, followed by the School Quota Protest Period from December 28, 2023, to January 17, 2024. The registration for SNPMB School Accounts is scheduled from January 8 to February 8, 2024, while the registration for SNPMB Student Accounts is from January 8 to February 15, 2024. The PDDS (Data and Document Filling) will occur from February 14 to 28, 2024, and the SNPB registration deadline is March 26, 2024. The SNBP results will be announced on March 26, 2024.
