Conducting gatherings with alumni undoubtedly brings numerous benefits. We hope the alumni will not hesitate to contribute their knowledge and thoughts," said Dr. Dudut.

USU PR - The Faculty of Nursing at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an Alumni Gathering event with the theme "Enhancing Quality Education For International University Recognition (EQUITY Project)." The event took place at the Grandhika Hotel in Medan on Thursday (21/21/2023).

Various events were held during the gathering, including a Sharing Session with alumni working abroad and domestically, a Talk Show by alumni discussing the role of alumni in USU rankings, followed by socializing, entertainment, and dinner.

The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology has assigned tasks to the campuses under its coordination to actively participate in improving international rankings annually. Therefore, in his speech, the Dean of the Faculty of Nursing at USU, Dr. Dudut Tanjung S.Kp., M.Kep., Sp.KMB highlighted alumni development and the improvement of USU's ranking as a world-class university (WCU).

"Conducting gatherings with alumni undoubtedly brings numerous benefits. We hope the alumni will not hesitate to contribute their knowledge and thoughts," said Dr. Dudut.

Addressing the theme, the Vice Dean III of the Faculty of Nursing at USU, Ikhsanuddin Ahmad Harahap S.Kp., MNS, had the opportunity to present on the role of alumni in the EQUITY Project at USU. The EQUITY Project is a university-wide program, and its implementation is delegated to each faculty, including the Faculty of Nursing.

"In essence, the EQUITY Project is an effort by USU to succeed in internationalization programs," explained Ikhsanuddin.

Marlisa, S.Kep., Ns., M.Kep., acting as a representative of the Alumni Association (IKA) of the Faculty of Nursing, stated that the role of alumni in the EQUITY Project is to collaborate synergistically with the academic community in the Faculty of Nursing. They are committed to providing full support for all programs initiated by USU, including WCU and the EQUITY Project.

"Surely, the Faculty of Nursing at USU alumni will provide support. Thus, the EQUITY Project can proceed smoothly," Marlisa emphasized.
