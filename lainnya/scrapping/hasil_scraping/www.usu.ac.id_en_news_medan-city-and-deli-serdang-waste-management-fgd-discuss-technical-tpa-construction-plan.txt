USU PUBLIC RELATIONS-MEDAN: In order to find a solution to the problem of urban waste, the Universitas Sumatera Utara in collaboration with the Medan City Government held a Focus Group Discussion on Waste Management in Medan City and Deli Serdang Regency, which was held online, Thursday (19/8/2021) morning . The FGD was opened by the USU Rector who was represented by USU Vice Rector III USU Vice Rector III Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., Apt.

The FGD was attended by the Head of the North Sumatra Regional Settlement Infrastructure, Mr. Syafril Tansier, ST, MT, the Head of the East Kalimantan Settlement Infrastructure Center, Mr. Sandhy Eko Bramono, PhD, the Head of the Water Resources, Cipta Karya and Spatial Planning Office of North Sumatra Province and the Head of Community Service -USU assignment Zaid Perdana Nasution, PhD.

USU's Vice Rector III on that occasion explained that Indonesia could follow Japan's example in dealing with the waste problem.Japan is one of the countries in the world that has succeeded in managing waste properly, as well as implementing various policies that make its people very disciplined and responsible for the waste produced from various personal activities.Likewise with the world of industry and offices, which have a very modern waste treatment system.

“In this country, it is very difficult to find pieces of garbage that are scattered on public roads, even into small alleys.The community is well educated and disciplined in applying the rules for personal waste disposal.The policies and regulations issued by the Japanese government in terms of waste management even regulate in detail the types of waste and schedules for waste disposal based on these types.There is no trash strewn on the streets, not even trash cans are available on public streets.Everyone is fully responsible for the waste generated in their activities," he explained.

Our country, he continued, of course has not been able to achieve such standardization, in particular Medan City and Deli Serdang Regency, where the waste problem is still one of the tough home-works that must be resolved by the Government.The socialization and education carried out, both to the community and the industrial world, have not produced the desired results.Meanwhile, the management of household and industrial waste has yet to find a maximum solution.Final Disposal Sites (TPA) of waste also often face very serious social problems, which require smart and wise solutions so as not to interfere with environmental sustainability and public health.

“Many solutions and innovations have been implemented, but waste management is still a classic problem that requires serious attention to be handled.No less important, increasing public awareness to implement clean behavior in various places and opportunities, which should continue to be encouraged, both by the Government and various parties who have the same concern for waste management," he said.

Furthermorehesaid that the solution to solve this problem cannot be solely borne by the Government alone.All parties must participate in calling and synergizing with the Government in finding solutions to overcome them, as well as finding new innovations that can be used in waste management.

"On the basis of this, the collaboration between the Universitas Sumatera Utara and the Medan City Government (Pemko) and the District Government of Deli Serdang, hopefully can provide the best solution in waste management, especially in the two areas.This FGD will be a good and appropriate momentum for all parties involved, both government elements, academics and environmental practitioners/activists, to share information and discuss in finding the best methods and technology in managing waste, both generated by the community and industry,” hoped Dr. Poppy.

Heasked that the FGD held be able to provide the best solution that can be immediately implemented, so that the waste problem in Medan City can be resolved properly.This waste management is very urgent to be done in order to ensure the fulfillment of the community's desirefora clean, healthy and comfortable environment in the city of Medan and its surroundings.

Head of the North Sumatra Regional Settlement Infrastructure Center, Syafriel Tansier, ST, MT, as one of the speakers delivered a material entitled Challenges of Planning and Construction of the Medan-Deli Serdang Regional TPA.Heexplained about the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the National Action Plan for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change and the Elaboration of the Implementation of the New Urban Agenda through the Cipta Karya Program.In addition, the policy direction for the development of residential infrastructure and the pattern of handling national waste management is also explained.

Meanwhile, the Chairperson of the Indonesian Association of Sanitary Engineers and Environmental Engineers in East Kalimantan Province, Sandhi Eko Bramono, PhD, discussed and presented information in the form of videos of well-organized Waste Management Sites in East Kalimantan.The third speaker from the Department of Water Resources, Cipta Karya and Spatial Planning presented a material entitled Challenges of Planning and Construction of the Medan-Deli Serdang Regional TPA with discussions, amongothers,about the spatial structure plan of Mebendaro and the stages of Planning for the Regional Landfill of Megulung.(RJ/©ULC)
