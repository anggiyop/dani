“Guys, it's better to stay away from things that are not positive and pursue positive things. Avoid drugs, because it is a harmful and not positive act,” Ance, USU FISIP student, said.

USU PR - Yuliance Alua, a Social Welfare Student at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) at the University of North Sumatra who won gold in the Softball PON XX branch, advised students and youth to avoid drugs. This was conveyed during direct communication with him via telephone on Friday (10/15/2021).

“Friends, it's better to stay away from things that are not positive and pursue positive things. Avoid drugs, because it is an act that is detrimental and not positive,” said Ance.

Ance said that a student or youth should take actions that can build themselves up. According to him, the opportunity to be a student and young age should be maximized with a variety of positive activities.

“Continue to explore the potential and talents that exist within you. Keep the spirit, "said Ance.

Ance himself had held training camps in several places such as Bogor and Medan. In Medan, He participated in a training held at the USU Softball Field. However, due to the pandemic, Ance is doing more exercises independently. As is known, Ance is one of the USU students who participated in the 2021 PON XX event which was held in Papua. On that occasion, Ance defended his homeland, namely Papua Province.

The moment to win gold in the Softball sport was obtained after defeating the North Sulawesi team with a score of 6-7 for the victory of the Papua Province contingent. The final match will be held on October 14, 2021.

"Friends from the department as well as the lecturers also congratulate. There was a post in Instagram to congratulate. Hopefully it will be a motivation for others," he concluded. (©ULC)
