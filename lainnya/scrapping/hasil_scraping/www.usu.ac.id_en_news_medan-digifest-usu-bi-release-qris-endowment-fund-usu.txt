Endowment Fund is a source of funding in the form of donations from the community to cover the shortage of funds in higher education.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) in collaboration with Bank Indonesia (BI) organized Medan Digifestival as well as released USU Endowment Fund QRIS at Pancasila Building USU, on Friday (25/08/2023).

Medan Digifestival is one of the activities of the 71st USU Anniversary series. Various activities contained in the Digifestival, including talk shows, fun walks, MSME and craft product markets, and product exhibitions from the financial services industry.

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., in his speech, explained that the phenomenon of cashless payments is increasing every year. Therefore, he said an understanding of digital financial literacy is important to be given to the community, especially USU students.

“So cashless is a phenomenon that will increase over time,” he explained.

Medan Digifestival is a form of USU's initial support, as the host, regarding the socialization of digital financial literacy. Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si. emphasized that there will be projects held to expand and deepen people's understanding of digital finance by utilizing the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) program later.

“We can do small projects in MBKM, which then have an impact on deepening people's understanding,” he said.

On the same occasion, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si. explained about the USU Endowment Fund, which had just been launched. The Endowment Fund is a source of funding in the form of donations from the community to cover the lack of funds in higher education.

“Endowment Fund is one of the funding sources to cover shortages,” he explained.

Representing the Mayor of Medan, Erwin Saleh, S.STP., M.A.P., touched on several cases of students trapped in online loan debt. He said that in addition to students who must be wise in managing funds, there must be policies from the state regarding assistance that can be provided to students who are financially difficult.

“Maybe there should be a policy from the state to provide easy loan assistance for students,” he said.

Based on the North Sumatra Financial Literacy and Inclusion Survey in 2022, the Financial Literacy Index is only 51.7%, while the Financial Inclusion Index has reached 95.58%.

Therefore, the Head of BI Representative of North Sumatra Province, IGP Wira Kusuma, explained the importance of the role of various parties, one of which is educational institutions, in educating the public about digital finance.

“Educational institutions have an important role in financial education in the community,” he explained.

IGP Wira Kusuma also expressed his congratulations on USU's 71st Anniversary. He hopes that USU can always produce the best and most qualified graduates.

“We extend our congratulations and success for the 71st USU Anniversary,” he said.

Director of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE, M.Si., said the Endowment Fund is one of the ways USU fulfills its obligation to seek funds for the sustainability of USU activities.

“Endowment Fund is one of the obligations carried out by universities to seek funds,” he said.

Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE, M.Si. hopes that information about the USU Endowment Fund can be spread well and that the academic community, USU partners, and the public can help USU develop.

“The most important thing is that this Endowment Fund is well socialized,” he hoped.
