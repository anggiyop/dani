"We hope that this collaboration can run smoothly and bring significant benefits to both parties, as well as support the development of higher education in North Sumatra," he said.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an audience with the Huria Kristen Batak Protestant Theological Seminary (STT HKBP). The meeting was attended by the USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., and the Chairman of STT HKBP, Dr. Sukanto Limbong, M.Th, along with the officials of the HKBP Nommensen University Foundation, Bilter A. Sirait. The meeting occurred at the Rector's Audience Room at USU on Thursday (May 16).

The USU Rector welcomed this initiative for collaboration and expressed USU's readiness to support the development of STT HKBP.

"We hope that this collaboration can run smoothly and bring significant benefits to both parties, as well as support the development of higher education in North Sumatra," he said.

In an interview, Dr. Sukanto Limbong stated that their visit to USU was to strengthen collaboration in various aspects of the three pillars of higher education. This collaboration will cover teaching, research, community service, institutional governance, and human resource development.

"We, from STT HKBP, want to be part of the development and growth of USU, which has reached the level of a world-class university," said Dr. Sukanto.

One important proposal from STT HKBP is a collaboration in research, particularly in sociology, anthropology, and psychology. Dr. Sukanto Limbong, M.Th., proposed exchanging human resources by involving lecturers from USU to teach at their campus. The implementation of this collaboration is expected to start as soon as possible, with an initial target of next year.

"We hope to collaborate in joint research and community service in our adopted villages," explained Dr. Limbong.

Bilter A. Sirait added that Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si.'s experience and leadership abilities demonstrate that USU is worthy of being a World-Class University (WCU). Bilter A. Sirait also emphasized that Prof. Muryanto Amin's leadership at USU is inspiring and can serve as an example for other leaders.

"USU's Rector's experience is valuable. We hope that his experience can be diffused to STT HKBP so that the entire Batak community, especially the HKBP, can benefit from his expertise," he said.

The audience concluded with optimism from both sides that the established collaboration will have a positive impact on the development of education and research in North Sumatra and strengthen the relationship between USU and STT HKBP.
