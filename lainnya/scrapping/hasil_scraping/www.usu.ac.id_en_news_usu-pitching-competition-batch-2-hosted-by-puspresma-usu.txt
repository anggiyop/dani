We encourage different faculties to coordinate, each bringing their expertise so that the programs they work on will have more comprehensive personnel," said Ir. Harso.

USU PR- The Universitas Sumatera Utara's Student Achievement Center (Puspresma USU) organized the USU Pitching Competition 2023 Batch 2 at the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Auditorium on Tuesday (31/10/2023).

Following the success of USU Pitching Batch 1, the Student Achievement Center, in collaboration with the Directorate of Student Achievements and Alumni Relations (Ditmawalumni), conducted Batch 2. The event featured 22 business groups from various categories: manufacturing, creative industries, arts and culture, tourism, applied technology, services, and trade.

Dr. Ir. E. Harso Kardhinata, M.Sc., Chairman of Puspresma USU, expressed appreciation for the students participating in USU Pitching Batch 2, as they generated brilliant ideas. Moreover, these groups comprised students from various disciplines.

"We encourage different faculties to coordinate, each bringing their expertise so that the programs they work on will have a more comprehensive personnel," said Ir. Harso.

The Chairman of Puspresma also added that USU Pitching serves as motivation for participants to advance to the next level, namely the Student Entrepreneurship Development Program (P2MW).

"Okay, we have the P2MW program. P2MW will be at the national level. If this is still funded by the university, it is hoped that what they gain now can enter the next stage in the nationally scaled P2MW," he explained.

Dr. T. Henny Febriana Harumy, S.Kom, M.Kom, a USU Pitching Batch 2 judge, expressed her hope that competitions like this could be held again next year with even more creative and brilliant ideas.

"Well, it's really good, the ideas are good. So, hopefully, next year, there will be another one, and the ideas will be even better," said Dr. Henny.

Unlike the previous batch, participants in Batch 2 were not required to have a business but could present business concept designs.
