"So, we can accept students from all over Indonesia, not just from Medan city. This reflects the diversity of Indonesia at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU)," he said.

USU PR — The Rector ofUniversitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., together with the leaders of the Board of Trustees (MWA), the Academic Senate, and the Professors Council (DGB), held an Iftar (Breaking of the Fast) event followed by Tarawih prayer. The event took place at the Digital Learning Center Building, 1st floor, on Wednesday (Apr. 1).

In this regard, the USU Rector discussed education development, especially in selecting new students. The Rector stated that there have been many changes compared to previous years. This year, there are several pathways for new student admissions, and USU is one of the preferred campuses for prospective students.

The Rector mentioned that USU continues to increase the quota for new student admissions, not only from within Medan city but also from outside Medan, especially from outside Sumatra Island.

"So, we can accept students from all over Indonesia, not just from Medan city. This reflects the diversity of Indonesia at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU)," he said.

Furthermore, the Rector added that the new student admission system has five criteria: report card grades, chosen subjects, school index, achievements, and scores determined by the chosen university.

"The decision of the Rector determines other scores. The Rector determines this," he added.
