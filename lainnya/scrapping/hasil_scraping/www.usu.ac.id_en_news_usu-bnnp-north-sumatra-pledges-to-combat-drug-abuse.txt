This step aims to protect students, lecturers, and staff from the potential dangers of drug abuse, which can seriously impact their future," explained the Head of the HR Bureau.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara(USU) Task Force for the Prevention of Abuse and Illicit Trafficking of Narcotics and Narcotics Precursors, together with the North Sumatra Provincial National Narcotics Agency(BNNP), conducted a Drug Check for Lecturers and Education Personnel in the USU Environment at the Student Center, Tuesday (17/10/2023).

The implementation of this activity is the mandate of the Indonesian Presidential Instruction No. 2 of 2020, which requires all institutions, including the Ministry of Education, to implement programs to prevent, abuse, and eradicate narcotics.

Head of the USU Human Resources Bureau, Dra. Syafnita Hanuru Silalahi, M.SP., in her remarks, explained that this activity was a determination to create a campus environment free from the use and distribution of narcotics as well as being one of the concrete actions in maintaining the environment and academic integrity of the campus from drug abuse.

"This step aims to protect students, lecturers, and staff from the potential dangers of drug abuse, which can seriously impact their future," explained Dra. Syafnita.

Furthermore, Dra. Syafnita Hanuru Silalahi, M.SP., conveyed the next steps planned after the examination. If a lecturer or educator is found to be exposed to narcotics, rehabilitation measures will be immediately implemented to help them.

In the context of cooperation, this activity is not the beginning of collaboration between USU and BNN.

Referring to the statement of the North Sumatra BNNP Representative, Nurfadhila, S.Psi., who said that, as a sign of BNN's commitment to supporting USU, the Central BNN had previously made several visits to USU.

"The Central BNN visits USU to provide education such as motivation to students, and conducts joint raids in one of the faculties at USU," said Nurfadhila.

The Chairperson of the USU Task Force for the Prevention of Abuse and Illicit Trafficking of Narcotics and Narcotic Precursors, Dr. Lita Sri Andayani, SKM, M.Kes., stated that to maintain the integrity and quality of academics at USU, currently, about 5% of them must undergo urine testing, which is a policy of the Ministry of Higher Education.

"To realize early detection of drug abuse, we have established a close partnership with the North Sumatra BNNP, which plays a central role in the implementation of the examination," said Dr. Lita.

Finally, Nurfadhila, S.Psi., hopes this effort can be sustainable, not only on this occasion but also in future years.
