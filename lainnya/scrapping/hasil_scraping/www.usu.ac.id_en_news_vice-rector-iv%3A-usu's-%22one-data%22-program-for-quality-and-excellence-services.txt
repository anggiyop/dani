"In this case, the Rector expressed how important it is for us to prepare data scientists who are able to handle the data, starting from collecting data, analyzing data, to visualizing data so that they can support university leadership decision making," said Vice Rector IV Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc in a routine morning rally in the courtyard of the USU Administrative Center Building, Monday (12/6/2021).

USU PR - One of the keys to the success of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) in meeting the target of quality and superior services to all USU academics is the success in the League of Legal Entity State Universities (LIGA-PTN BH) competition, namely the availability of complete, integrated and easily accessible.

"In this case, the Rector expressed how important it is for us to prepare data scientists who are able to handle the data, starting from collecting data, analyzing data, to visualizing data so that they can support university leadership decision making," said Vice Rector IV Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc in a routine morning rally in the courtyard of the USU Administrative Center Building, Monday (12/6/2021).

Prof. Opim said this step was the initiation of USU "One Data" program which is expected to be completed in the current leadership period.

"For this we need experts who are reliable in the field of data science," he said.

He also invites lecturers and education staff to enter the world of data science and deepen their knowledge to become professional data scientists who are indispensable in the "advanced information" era.

Prof. Opim also said that currently USU has completed the use of electronic signatures (TTE) in collaboration with the National Cyber ​​and Crypto Agency (BSSN) cq. Electronic Certification Center (BSrE) which has issued electronic certificates for USU. "In addition to being able to be used for electronic signature certification, this certificate will also apply to all accompanying documents," he said.

Prof. Opim explained that in the first period, the affixing of electronic signatures could be done by the Rector, vice Rector, and heads of bureaus within USU. Furthermore, this electronic signature will immediately be forwarded to the heads of work units at the faculty/study program level and all institutions/units within USU.

"In addition to ensuring the authenticity and security of letters, it is hoped that the issuance of this electronic document will have an impact on saving paper use and strengthen the support of the Universitas Sumatera Utara as a green campus," he said. (©ULC)
