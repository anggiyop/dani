THAILAND-USU PR: The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a working meeting to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) in Thailand on Monday, (10/03/2022). This working meeting aims to improve the academic quality of students and teaching staff of both universities. This is also main program of USU in the context of campus internationalization.

USU Rector Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.si in his speech said that this meeting was a follow-up to previous communications. He said that USU and the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) had the same vision in building a better academic atmosphere.

"Hopefully sharing information in this meeting will be able to bring together good and progressive thoughts, to encourage active collaboration and sustainable implementation," the Rector of USU said.

He further stated that this cooperation will organize several programs. As stated, this active collaboration is implemented in the form of short course activities, workshops, public lectures, and other activities that become a forum for students and teaching staff to interact and innovate together.

Supporting programs for this collaboration are also designed in the plan of student exchange programs, international scientific programs and guest lectures between universities. In detail the program is planned in the Summer Course International activities.

“This is also possible through student exchange programs, international scientific programs and guest lectures between universities. We open up space for further collaboration in the International Summer Course and involvement and services in the international community, both in Pathum Thani and North Sumatra," the Rector said.

Meanwhile, the President of AIT, Prof. Kazuno Yamamoto also invited USU to develop cooperation through concrete ideas that can be implemented, one of which is through Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

“This collaboration is a happy thing for us and we hope that it will be implemented soon and can even cover a wider area. Moreover, we hope that the fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence can be one of our focuses in this collaboration," he said.
