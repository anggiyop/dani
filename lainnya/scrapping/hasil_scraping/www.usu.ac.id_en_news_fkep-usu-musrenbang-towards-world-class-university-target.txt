"Achieving the target to become a world-class university is the final target. So for that, we have prepared what activities we have to prepare the necessary budgets," Prof. Opim said.

USU PR - The Faculty of Nursing, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Development Planning Deliberation (Musrenbang) towards the target of a world class university.

The event was held in the Hall of the Faculty of Nursing on Thursday, (09/29/2022).

Vice Rector IV for Information, Planning, and Development USU Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc is ready to support all planning and budgeting needs.

The work units at the faculty and university levels must have a consistent goal of internationalization. With that, strategic programs in the academic and non-academic fields can already be prepared.

"Achieving the target to become a world-class university is the final target. So for that, we have prepared what activities we need to prepare the necessary budgets," said USU's Vice Rector IV for Information, Planning and Development.

According to Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc in supporting internationalization, it is necessary to have adequate infrastructure and facilities to support the activities of students and lecturers. So that the USU nursing faculty is not only excels in accreditation rankings but also produces the best graduates.

"Later, foreign students will come, our students will leave, our lecturers will go out, foreign lecturers who come will also need facilities and infrastructure, so it must be planned in a comprehensive manner," he added.

The Dean of the USU Faculty of Nursing Dr. Dudut Tanjung, SKp, M.Kep, Sp.KMB said that program planning until 2023 will be structured in such a way as to achieve targets of the main performance indicator (IKU) and World Class University rankings.

Furthermore, programs that are comprehensively structured to create world-class faculty will also be designed in a rational time.

Dr. Dudut Tanjung, SKp, M.Kep, Sp.KMB hopes that the academic community such as lecturers and education staff of the USU Faculty of Nursing will jointly focus on the target in order to achieve the same goal.

"Of course, the consolidation of all elements in the Faculty of Nursing, whether it's the study program, whether it's the department, teaching staff lecturers, must have the same target," added Dr. Tanjung sitting. (©ULC)
