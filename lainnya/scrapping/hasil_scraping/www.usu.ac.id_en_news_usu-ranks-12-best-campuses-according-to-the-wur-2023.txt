"Alhamdulillah, USU has been included in THE WUR assessment in 2023, which is in 18 universities in Indonesia. The previous year USU was still in the "reporter" position. This position provided a strong spirit for USU to continue to improve services that were assessed by international institutions (THE WUR)," the USU Rector said.

USU PR - The ranking of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) in the international ranking agency Times Higher Education World University Rankings (THE WUR) 2023 has improved. After previously being a "reporter" or not getting a score, in the latest release, USU's ranking in THE WUR 2023 is ranked as the 12th best university in Indonesia.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, responded favorably to the increase in USU's ranking in THE WUR 2023. USU's inclusion in the national rankings is an indicator of the success of the internationalization program that has been launched.

"Alhamdulillah, USU has been included in THE WUR assessment in 2023, which is in 18 universities in Indonesia. The previous year USU was still in the "reporter" position. This position provided a strong spirit for USU to continue to improve services that were assessed by international institutions (THE WUR)," Mury said in his statement on Wednesday (10/12/2022).

The Rector hopes that USU internationalization achievement in the coming year will be even better. "Please pray from the whole community to advance education in Indonesia globally," he said.

THE WUR itself is a ranking of world universities using five indicators, namely teaching, research, citations, industry, income and international outlook. There are 1,600 universities from 99 countries on the list.

Launching data from THE WUR page, USU's ranking in the world's best universities is 1501+ or 1799, with a total score of 10.4-18.3. In the national ranking, of the 18 universities that are included in the THE WUR ranking, USU shot to 12th position.

According to THE WUR 2023 data, USU's highest point lies in the transfer of knowledge (industrial income), while what still needs to be improved is the point of the learning environment (teaching). In detail, the values ​​obtained by USU include the Teaching indicator (Weight 30%) USU gets a score of 15.4, the Research indicator (Weight 30%) scores 9.9, the Citation indicator (30%) scores 25.1, and Industry income (2.5%) scored 38 and the international outlook indicator (7.5%) scored 22. Overall USU's score was 17.72.

Director of the Directorate of Internationalization and Global Cooperation Prof. Dr. eng. Himsar Ambarita S.T., M.T. explained, for this year there are 18 universities from Indonesia that are ranked and 7 with the status of "reporter". Nationally, USU is in the 12th position out of 18 universities that are ranked. This sequence is obtained from the Data Point report from THE WUR submitted to USU.

Previously, USU had also won the Superior accreditation from BAN-PT. These two close achievements show that "The Transformation Towards the Ultimate" is starting to have an impact on the progress of this proud Universitas Sumatera Utara. (©ULC)
