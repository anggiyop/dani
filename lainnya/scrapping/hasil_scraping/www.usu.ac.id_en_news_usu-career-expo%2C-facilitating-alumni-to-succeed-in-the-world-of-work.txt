“I would like to thank Mr. / Mrs. Leaders / Representatives of Companies / Business Partners who have attended and participated in this activity,” said Prof. Poppy.

 

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) through the Research and Innovation Development Agency (BPRI) organized the USU Career Expo 2025 on Wednesday-Thursday (12-13/02/2024) at Gelanggang Mahasiswa. This routine four-month event was attended by 18 partner companies from various sectors that offered walk-in interviews and talk show sessions related to personal branding and career development.

 

In a speech by the Vice Rector III of USU, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., Apt read by the Manager of Entrepreneurship and Career Development of BPRI USU, Ami Dilham SE., M.Si, she expressed her gratitude for the implementation of this event as well as appreciation to all partner companies that have supported this activity.

 

“I would like to thank Mr. / Mrs. Leaders / Representatives of Companies / Business Partners who have attended and participated in this activity,” she said.

 

Ami Dilham explained that USU Career Expo 2025 is a strategic place to facilitate companies' finding potential candidates and help job seekers get jobs that suit their desires. In addition, this event is expected to make a real contribution to reducing unemployment in Indonesia.

 

“This event is a bridge connecting alumni with companies that provide jobs,” he said.

 

BPRI USU Chairperson Dr. Buchari explained that the Career Expo implements various previous training programs, such as CV-making workshops and job interview preparation.

 

“So this is the implementation of them applying for jobs here,” said Buchari.

 

Based on data from 2024, around 10% of applicants who participated in the previous Career Expo managed to get a job. This shows that the activity effectively bridges USU graduates with companies that need workers.

 

“Data for 2024, USU alumni who were accepted to work with those who applied were approximately 10% (the difference) of those who applied,” explained Buchari.

 

To ensure long-term benefits for alumni, BPRI USU's Manager of Entrepreneurship and Career Development, Ami Dilham SE., M.Si. explained that USU screens participating companies, ensuring they offer clear career paths and not just short-term contracts. In addition to job fairs, partner companies are also involved in the campus hiring program, with more than 200 companies regularly collaborating with USU for workforce recruitment.

 

“So there is a career path companies will carry out to recruit our alumni,” Ami explained.

 

USU Career Expo 2025 is not only a job search platform for alumni but also proves USU's commitment to producing qualified graduates who are ready to compete in the professional world.
