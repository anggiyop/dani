First, it is necessary to reposition the MBKM policy in FKG. In accordance with the message from the Minister of Education and Culture, this MBKM program can be followed by the health sciences, so it must be realized immediately. "How it looks, what it looks like if FKG students join the MBKM program, becomes a challenge for FKG," said Dr. Muryanto Amin.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si inaugurated and took the oath of office of Dr. Olivia Avriyanti Hanafiah, drg., Sp.BM (K) as Deputy Dean I of the Faculty of Dentistry (FKG) on Monday (11/01/2021).

In his remarks, the USU Rector conveyed to the vice dean I about three priority programs for 2022 that must be accelerated, in accordance with the USU Strategic Plan (Renstra), the Rector's Work Program, and Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

First, it is necessary to reposition the MBKM policy in FKG. In accordance with the message of the Minister of Education and Culture, this MBKM program can be followed by the health sciences, therefore it must be realized immediately. "How it looks, what it looks like if FKG students join the MBKM program, becomes a challenge for FKG," said Dr. Muryanto Amin.

The Rector said it was important to realize the MBKM program in the field of health sciences. Vice dean I is expected to be able to make innovations so that FKG students can learn something outside of curriculum design and outside of scientific disciplines.

Second, the productivity of FKG students in the field of science needs to be improved. "During the implementation of PIMNAS, I saw many proposals and innovations that Indonesian students could compete with in the field of FKG," he said.

The faculty is expected to facilitate and direct students to create innovative works in the field of dentistry. “Of course the relationship between lecturers and students in this Student Creativity Program is important, how the class can produce innovative proposals. This is also a challenge for Deputy Dean I,” he said.

Third, the facilities needed in the learning classroom must be arranged better. Equipment in the laboratory must be able to meet the needs of students to the maximum. Each laboratory is required to have a master plan for repairing equipment, SOPs, and laboratory assistants.

“Each faculty must have a master plan to propose repairs to tools, SOPs and laboratory assistants. We need to draw up the road map,” said Muryanto.

Aside of the three priority programs, the Rector also gave advice that a faculty leader must have two things, namely not only understanding scientific matters, but also understanding the administrative details needed.

"In addition to understanding the substance of science, it is also necessary to know the administration and develop programs," he said.

Deputy Dean I Dr. Olivia said she would carry out priority programs according to the rector's instructions, namely carrying out learning tasks, organizing scientific productivity processes and helping the dean for other work. "In addition, USU's FKG accreditation is also a priority in early next year," Olivia said. (©ULC)
