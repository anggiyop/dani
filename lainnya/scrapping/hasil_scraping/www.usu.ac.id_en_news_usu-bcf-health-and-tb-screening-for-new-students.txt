The TB screening involved 2,620 new USU students and is included in the standard procedure for further student health checks to prevent the spread of TB among productive age groups. This TB screening activity was carried out from August 12, 2023, to August 16, 2023," Amalia said in her statement Monday (14/8/2023)

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Bakrie Center Foundation (BCF) collaborated to conduct health and TB screening for new students.

"This TB screening involves 2,620 new USU students and is included in the standard procedure for examining new student health to prevent the spread of TB among productive age groups. This TB screening activity was carried out from August 12, 2023, to August 16, 2023," Amalia said in her statement Monday (14/8/2023).

This activity is also supported by the business world, namely with the involvement of PT Bakrie Sumatera Plantations Tbk, PT Bumi Resources, and PT Dairi Prima Mineral in the process of educating the people of North Sumatra to improve the quality of public health to support economic improvement.

Chairperson of the USU New Student Tuberculosis Screening Program, Dr. Isti Ilmiati Fujiati, explained that this TB screening is also a campaign carried out by all stakeholders to prevent and overcome Tuberculosis, which mainly attacks people of productive age.

"TB is everyone’s concern. Information about TB must reach students and is expected to be continued in the community. In this TB screening, there was also an education session involving TB Rangers from the Campus Leaders Program 7 thematic internship program, Yayasan Mentari Meraki Asa cadres, and Indonesia Muda untuk Tuberculosis," he said.

The flow of implementing TB clinical symptom screening is technical. First, students are asked to measure body temperature through the SOBAT TB application link, enter the waiting room and fill out the https: /bit.ly/skriningtbusu form. While waiting in line, students are educated about the spread of TB, then the screening process using an x-ray or Molecular Rapid Test (TCM). From the results of this TB screening, there will be a follow-up from the university if it finds students who are indicated positive for TB.

"If students are clinically positive for TB, treatment will be carried out at the USU Hospital TB Clinic to investigate their close contacts so there is no spread. Students who are positive for TB will get maximum care and treatment," he said.
