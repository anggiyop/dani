Vice-Rector V said that all university activities must be carried out with the Tri Dharma, namely education, research, and community service. Everything must be done well and exposed to the University's Tri Dharma.

PR USU - Vice-Rector V for Asset Management and Business, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Ir. Luhut Sihombing, MP, and all supporting components under him are ready to start an orderly and structured plan to achieve the Tri Dharma University goals. It was conveyed during the routine morning assembly at the USU Central Administration Bureau Building Court on Monday (20/06/2022).

Vice-Rector V said that all university activities must be carried out with the Tri Dharma, namely education, research, and community service. Everything must be done well and exposed to the University's Tri Dharma.

VR V explained that USU has several fields: assets, security, and business. These three fields must work together to lead to a good university administration that is also matrix-oriented. All components must be interconnected and work together so that there is no overlap between one field and another.

"The implementation of fields at USU must be interconnected and work together so that there is no overlap," he said.

In the organization of a university, there must be a plan, where all activities must have a plan for today, tomorrow, next month, and so on, so that no work that should be carried out correctly is forgotten and delayed, thus damaging the organization of other universities.

"All activities must have a plan for today, tomorrow, and next month so that no event is forgotten," he said.

Vice-Rector V also said that it seems that next semester we will be able to resume teaching and learning activities offline or face-to-face. It is hoped that lecturers and employees must have strong enough energy to serve students well. Therefore it is necessary to cooperate to produce good services.

"Let us work together so that USU has better planning and implementation," he concluded.
