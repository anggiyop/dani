The MoU states that universities are expected to provide facilities and conveniences for persons with disabilities. This facility is manifested in establishing a Disability Service Unit in every university in Medan City.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) expressed a commitment to provide access and empower people with disabilities. This commitment was marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Disability Commission (KDN), which was held at the University Hall of HKBP Nommensen, Medan, on Tuesday (14/6/2022). Besides USU, the leaders of universities in Medan were also present.

The head of the USU Cooperation, Research and Community Service Bureau, Surya Darma, signed the MoU with the Head of Indonesian KDN Dante Rigmalia. The signing was also witnessed by the Head of the USU Architecture Profession Department, Dr. Ar. Achmad Delianur Nasution ST., MT., IAI., AA., IAP, USU Head of Public Relations, Promotion, and Protocol Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., Psychologist and the Indonesian National Police Commissioner.

The MoU states that universities are expected to provide facilities and conveniences for persons with disabilities. This facility is manifested in establishing a Disability Service Unit in every university in Medan City.

Universities are also expected to improve the competence of educators and education staff in higher education in dealing with students with disabilities.

The basic rule is the Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 13 of 2020 concerning Adequate Accommodation for Students with Disabilities. It is written that the Disability Service Unit in higher education is carried out independently by each Higher Education Organizing Institution and has the following duties; 1. perform a needs analysis; 2. provide recommendations; 3. carry out technical training and guidance; 4. carry out assistance; and 5. carry out monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.

According to the 2018 Basic Health Research (Riskesda) data, people with disabilities who managed to graduate from college were only 17.6% of the total people with disabilities.

Meanwhile, according to the Central Statistics Agency, employment opportunities for people with disabilities in 2016-2019 never grew more than 49%. Furthermore, according to Susenas, the educational attainment of persons with disabilities at the tertiary level in 2018-2020 is still low and even decreased in 2020.

The activity, which was also filled with KDN workshops with higher education institutions, also discussed the rights of persons with disabilities at universities in Medan City. It is intended to see the good practices that have been and are being carried out by each university to fulfill the educational rights of persons with disabilities.
