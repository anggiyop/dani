USU PR - Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, inaugurated the lecturer room of the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) on Friday, (08/09/2023).

Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business, Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si said that initially, this lecturer room was only able to accommodate 15 to 20 people, while each year there were additional lecturers initiated by the university. Therefore, the inauguration of the new lecturer room was carried out with the addition of 30 spaces for lecturers. To date, 48 lecturer desks have been facilitated.

"So it was deemed necessary to add or carry out maintenance so that with this maintenance, an additional 30 spaces for lecturers could be fulfilled. So in total, 48 lecturer desks can be facilitated," said the Dean of FEB.

In addition to the maintenance of the lecturer rooms, the Dean of FEB said that maintenance is also currently being carried out on the postgraduate building. Dr. Fadli said this maintenance will be completed in early October.

"In terms of ongoing infrastructure, the university is also supporting the maintenance of the postgraduate building which, Insyallah, will also be completed in early October," said Dr. Fadli.

Dr. Fadli said that the maintenance of this infrastructure is expected to meet the internationalization standards that are the university's work program. He also hopes that the maintenance of the lecturers' room can motivate lecturers to be more active in carrying out the Tri Dharma of Higher Education.

"Now, later on, these various infrastructure facilities are expected to meet internationalization standards, which is indeed the work program of the university," said Dr. Fadli.

The event was followed by lunch together as well as the signing of the momentum of the inauguration of the lecturer room.
