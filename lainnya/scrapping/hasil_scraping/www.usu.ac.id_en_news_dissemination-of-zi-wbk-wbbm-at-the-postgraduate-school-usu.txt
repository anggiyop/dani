We all know how important integrity is in carrying out tasks and responsibilities. Integrity is not just a word but also the fundamental basis of a strong and quality system," stated the Director of the Postgraduate School USU

USU PR- The Postgraduate School of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has conducted the ZI-WBK-WBBM Workshop (Zone of Integrity for Corruption-Free and Clean Bureaucracy) as part of USU's commitment to creating a work environment free from corrupt practices, collusion, and nepotism. The workshop occurred at the Master of Management Auditorium of the Postgraduate School USU on Monday (11/20/2023)

The workshop was attended by USU's Vice Rector II, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP., the Director of the Postgraduate School USU represented by Prof. Dr. Ir. Hamidah Harahap, M.Sc., the Vice Dean II of the Postgraduate School, Head of the Administration Division of the Postgraduate School, Education and Finance Staff, Equipment, PUMK, and all payment clerks within Universitas Sumatera Utara, as well as 118 workshop participants from 16 faculties in USU.

The speakers for this workshop were Yudi Purnomo Harahap, S.H., M.Hum., a member of the Special Task Force for Corruption Prevention of the Indonesian National Police (POLRI), and Dr. Drs. Victor Lumbanraja, M.AP., M.SP., a member of the Directorate of Bureaucratic Reform and Transformation Strengthening Team of USU.

In her opening remarks, Prof. Dr. Ir. Hamidah Harahap, M.Sc., representing the Director of the Postgraduate School USU, emphasized the importance of integrity in carrying out tasks and responsibilities in the workplace and society. She highlighted that integrity is not just a word but also the fundamental basis of a strong and quality system.

"We all know how important integrity is in carrying out tasks and responsibilities. Integrity is not just a word but also the fundamental basis of a strong and quality system," stated the Director of the Postgraduate School USU.

The ZI-WBK-WBBM Workshop is a tangible commitment from USU to create a work environment free from corrupt practices, collusion, and nepotism. The activity aims to ensure that all staff, especially Education and Finance personnel, equipment managers, payment clerks, and PUMK, can perform their duties effectively and with integrity in serving the USU community, thus avoiding undesirable issues.

Furthermore, Dr. Drs. Victor Lumbanraja, M.AP., M.SP. expressed that this workshop also supports the vision and mission of the USU Rector, namely, to become a World-Class University. If the management of each unit functions well, a World-Class University can be realized because these two aspects are directly related.

"This workshop is also intended as a form of support in realizing the vision and mission of the USU Rector, as we know, a World-Class University, so the need for good management in each unit to achieve these visions and missions because these two things are interrelated," said Victor.

Yudi Purnomo Harahap, S.H., M.Hum. acknowledged that USU is strongly committed to establishing a zone of integrity free from corruption and a bureaucracy that serves with integrity. This commitment also represents USU's support for government efforts to prevent corruption wherever it may occur.

"It is known that USU has a high commitment to forming a zone of integrity free from corruption and bureaucracy that serves with integrity, so on the other hand, it is also a form of support from USU in helping government efforts to prevent corruption in any space," responded Yudi, a member of the special anti-corruption task force of the Indonesian National Police.

Speaking about the embodiment of USU's commitment, Dr. Drs. Victor Lumbanraja stated that eradicating corruption can be achieved through actions, including using e-office applications. This is based on the evaluation that interactions create opportunities for corruption, and exchanges can be reduced through applications and similar tools.

Therefore, students dealing with administrative matters no longer need face-to-face meetings; everything can be done through applications or websites. A strong push is required to ensure that all processes at USU can be completed through the e-office.

"We are also striving for the use of e-office applications at USU as a tangible form of commitment. This is also a solution from the evaluation that has been carried out, that through applications, interactions in corruption can be reduced," added Victor.

Implementing a corruption-free environment on campus should also begin with the integrity of its personnel because, with personnel with integrity, commitments to anti-corruption can be realized. Thus far, USU has created anti-corruption programs, including programs for new students and existing financial systems, ensuring that all personnel within the university are incorruptible, unwilling to engage in corruption, and afraid of corruption.

In conclusion, Yudi Purnomo expressed hope that with determination and a strong commitment, USU can become a benchmark in anti-corruption efforts in higher education, ultimately establishing USU as a corruption-free campus.
