“Around October last year, we began the physical work, including procurement and content preparation. By the beginning of this year, the space was ready to be showcased, although some elements are still pending due to delayed equipment delivery,” said the Head of PSI, USU.

 

USU PR - The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., along with the university’s leadership, held a Ramadan Tausyiah and Iftar event at the 8th floor of the Digital Learning Center Building on Monday, March 25, 2024.

During the gathering, the Rector discussed the concept of an Entrepreneur University, emphasizing the university's goal of becoming a campus that fosters entrepreneurial spirit among students, encouraging them to start their own businesses.

The event continued with a seven-minute Tausyiah lecture that explored the significance of fasting and the benefits of reading the Quran. Emphasis was placed on understanding Quranic verses and teachings that can be applied in daily life, especially for the entire USU academic community. Following the Iftar, participants engaged in group prayers and a guided tour of the digital facilities led by the Head of USU’s Information Systems Center (PSI), Mohammad Fadly Syah Putra, M.Sc.

Mohammad Fadly Syah Putra, M.Sc., explained that preparations for the digital space began in October, including the development of learning content and the acquisition of equipment. By early 2024, the digital space was ready to be showcased. He also mentioned that PSI is currently preparing learning content for an international course that will be offered in 16 study programs, to be delivered through virtual reality technology or interactive methods.

“Around October last year, we began the physical work, including procurement and content preparation. By the beginning of this year, the space was ready to be showcased, although some elements are still pending due to delayed equipment delivery,” said the Head of PSI, USU.

Regarding the use of space in the Digital Learning Center Building, Mohammad Fadly noted that the 3rd floor will be used as an exhibition space to display various works, while the 4th floor will be dedicated to workshops, content creation, and laboratories. The 5th floor will be utilized for discussions between faculty and students, where professors can seek assistance in creating educational materials.

“The 3rd floor will showcase works and simulations, the 4th floor is for content creation and workshops, and the 5th floor is for discussions and consultations with faculty,” he added.

Summarizing the Tausyiah and Iftar events, Mohammad Fadly emphasized that spiritual activities like these are particularly important during the holy month of Ramadan. It is a time for gathering, sharing information, and engaging in collective worship, reflecting the religious values that should be prioritized during this sacred month.

“By gathering with deans, unit heads, secretaries, and managers, this semi-formal meeting also serves as an opportunity to exchange information, share experiences, and pray together, which highlights the religious values we uphold,” concluded Mohammad Fadly.
