HPN raised the theme of free democracy and dignity. Of course, this is very much related to a good democracy. Certainly, we will become a dignified country," said the USU Secretary.

HUMAS USU - The University of North Sumatra (USU), represented by the Secretary of the University, Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp.F.E.R attended the commemoration of National Press Day (HPN) 2023, which was held at the North Sumatra Provincial Government Building. The event was officially started by the Governor of North Sumatra, Edy Rahmayadi, on Tuesday (08/02/2023).

Presidential Decree No. 5 year 1985, stipulates that HPN is commemorated every 9 February. It coincides with the anniversary of the Indonesian Journalists Association. North Sumatra has the honour of hosting the 2023 HPN commemoration.

"Free Press Dignified Democracy" is the title of the 2023 HPN commemoration. The University Secretary said democracy and dignity are two things that are mutually interconnected. The press is considered to have a significant role in creating this.

"HPN raised the theme of free democracy and dignity. Of course, this is very much related to a good democracy. Certainly, we will become a dignified country," said the USU Secretary.

According to Prof. Dr Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp.F.E.R, the press has played an important role in the country from the time of fighting for independence to the time of rapid development.

"It turns out that our press world is now more than a century old and has played a big role since the time of independence until now our country has made such rapid development. Alhamdulillah, hopefully, the press will be more successful," said Prof Fidel.

Not only for the country, the role of the press in universities, especially USU, is very crucial. The Secretary of the University said that USU's publications and progress would not be heard by the public without the press's role. Therefore, he hopes the student press can remain alive, especially within USU.

"Of course, we both know that without this press, some publications or progress achieved by USU will certainly not be published properly so that not many people know about our campus, especially," he added.
