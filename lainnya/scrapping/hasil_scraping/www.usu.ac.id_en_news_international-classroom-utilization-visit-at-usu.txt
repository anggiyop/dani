"The international classrooms available at several faculties have been utilized for existing international activities," said USU Vice Rector I.

USU PR—Starting from the Faculty of Engineering (FT), Faculty of Agriculture (FP), Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP), Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), Faculty of Law (FH), and Faculty of Dentistry (FKG) to the Institute for Curriculum and Learning Innovation (LINKUP) USU, Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., and Vice-Rector V, Ir, conducted a review of the use of international classrooms. Luhut Sihombing, M.P., on Monday (Mar. 25)

The review of the international classrooms designed by USU was to respond to the vision of Internationalization, as embedded in USU's tagline, Transformation Towards the Ultimate. A review was conducted on several faculties that were visited to see the extent of the functionality of the internationalization rooms.

For faculties that do not yet have internationalization classrooms because they do not meet the criteria, Vice Rector I USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., suggested filling them with selective regular classes. The classroom can also be converted for use by international guests when visiting. Many faculties have used these classrooms to support the development of internationalization activities on campus.

"The international classrooms available at several faculties have been utilized for existing international activities," said Vice Rector I USU.

Vice-Rector V for Asset and Business Management, Ir. Luhut Sihombing, M.P., mentioned that all the facilities provided have been handed over to be established according to the plans that have been arranged. There are still some areas for improvement, so more thorough preparation is needed. The hope is that rooms designated as internationalization classrooms and all rooms at USU should approach and be usable in various internationalization activities.

"We have high hopes that the classrooms at USU will not only be the ones reviewed but all of them can be empowered in internationalization activities," added Ir. Luhut Sihombing, M.P.
