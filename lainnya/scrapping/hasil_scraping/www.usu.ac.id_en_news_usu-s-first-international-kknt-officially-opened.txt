One of the parameters is the number of foreign students who study and gain knowledge in our place and the number of our students who can gain knowledge with foreign students abroad," said Prof. Rudy.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the opening of the International Thematic Real Work Lecture (KKNT) on Monday, (14/08/2023). The opening was held in Tuktuk Siadong Village, Simanindo District, Samosir Regency, North Sumatra Province.

International KKNT is a KKNT program designed by USU involving foreign student participants from various countries. On this first occasion, International KKNT participants consisted of 19 foreign students and 10 Universitas Sumatera Utara students. This KKNT program was held for 14 days.

Head of the USU Office of International Affairs, Prof. Dr. Rudy Sofyan, S.S., M.Hum, said that the International KKNT program is the realization of the university's vision.

"One of the parameters is the number of foreign students who study and gain knowledge in our place and the number of our students who can gain knowledge with foreign students abroad," said Prof. Rudy.

In line with that, the Head of KKNT PPM USU, Dr. Zulfan Lubis, S.S., M.Hum, expressed his hopes for the KKNT participants towards Tuktuk Village.

"We hope that the USU international KKN students in 2023 will innovate in the field of ecotourism and digitalization of this village," said Dr. Zulfan.

Dr. Zulfan added that one of the great potentials owned by Tuktuk Siadong Village is tourism potential. But until now, this potential has not been maximized due to the lack of promotion in the internet digital space.

That way he hopes that the International KKNNT held in Tuktuk Village can help increase the tourism potential of Tuktuk Village.

"So we really hope that all participants of this international KKN can realize what they have programmed, that this village becomes a digitized ecotourism village," said Dr. Zulfan.
