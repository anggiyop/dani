USU PR — To commemorate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Belgium, the Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), in collaboration with the Indonesian Embassy, held a public lecture titled "Europe Indonesia Relationship: Celebrating 75 Years with Belgium". The event was held at the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB) USU on Thursday (Jun. 20, 2024).

The event was attended by the Vice Rector III of USU, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., and the Belgian Ambassador to Indonesia, H.E. Frank Felix, as speakers.

In her remarks, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., highlighted the 75 years of diplomatic relations between Belgium and Indonesia. She stated that this event was important for USU students to learn from the speakers' expertise to gain knowledge and experience.

"This event is a rare and valuable opportunity, especially for USU students present here, to gain knowledge and insights from the speakers. I hope the participants can make the most of the time and opportunity available," said Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt.

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., stated that this public lecture aimed to provide an overview of Belgium and its culture and answer students' questions about educational opportunities there.

"Providing a general explanation about Belgium and its culture, and students also asked about the possibility of studying there and scholarships available," said Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt.

As a speaker, H.E. Frank Felix revealed that the material presented aimed to explain Europe and share this perspective with students to show how current issues affect the world.

"Explaining a little about Europe, people see us as a big monolith that doesn't always have a clear vision. I want to change that image slightly. I wanted to share it with the students to understand how all the day's issues affect the world.," said H.E. Frank Felix.

Furthermore, H.E. Frank Felix hopes that there will be a better understanding after this event. He sees this as an opportunity to share thoughts and ideas with students and to increase understanding and cooperation.

"To have a better understanding, it's a way to share thoughts and ideas with a young audience, as the leaders of tomorrow are sitting here. Hopefully, I left a little seed to help them understand more," H. E. Frank Felix said.
