Dean of FEB USU Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si hopes that apart from the seminars held, there will be other collaborations that can be forged together between IFG and USU's FEB such as in the Merdeka Learning Campus program and inviting practitioners to directly teach students.

PUBLIC RELATION USU - Indonesia Financial Group (IFG) in collaboration with the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Seminar and Public Lecture with the theme "Basic Literacy and Introduction to the Insurance & Pension Fund Industry". This activity was held in the Hall of Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto on Thursday, (12/1/2022).

As a form of IFG's concern, the BUMN Insurance and Guarantee Holding held Seminars and Public Lectures which aimed to provide basic knowledge to students, especially in the Faculty of Economics and Business.

Dean of FEB USU Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si hoped that apart from the seminars held, there would be other collaborations that could be forged together between IFG and USU FEB such as in the Merdeka Learning Campus program and inviting practitioners to directly teach students.

"Apart from providing knowledge to students, it is hoped that IFG and USU FEB can continue their collaboration. The activities are not only from seminars, but also focus more on Merdeka Learning on the Merdeka Campus. Later we will try to initiate this activity whether by inviting practitioners to teach on campus or certified internships," the Dean of USU FEB said.

IFG Progress Senior Research Associate Ibrahim Kholilul Rohman explained that IFG Progress' target is for students to go through financial literacy or insurance as protection because students will be able to implement this basic knowledge and contribute effectively when they enter the world of work.

"The result is always the same that literacy in the non-banking financial sector is very low. Finally we realized that if we want to improve, we have to pick up the ball and one thing that we think is very effective is the students, because the students will soon be working so they are expected to be able to increase their capacity and contribute,” the Senior Research Associate of IFG Progress explained.

Ibrahim Kholilul Rohman also hopes that various plans for further types of collaboration with USU FEB can be carried out immediately such as apprenticeships, study studies, and research collaborations.

"It is possible for an internship or apprenticeship, for example, for those who graduated in their last year to go to Jakarta to work with us or for example to work remotely, it is also possible. Then carry out study studies such as writing theses, theses, or dissertations, papers for conferences by utilizing local data in North Sumatra as well as data that we have nationally. We will be able to do a lot of research collaborations together,” explained the Senior Research Associate of IFG Progress.

As additional information, the seminars were held in line with the objectives of IFG Progress, which is to conduct studies that can be used to increase financial literacy, especially in the financial and banking industry, and then the information will be shared with the public, students, academics and other agencies.
