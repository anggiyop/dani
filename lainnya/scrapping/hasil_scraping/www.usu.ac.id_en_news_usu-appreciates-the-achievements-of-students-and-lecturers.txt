"Fairness is associated with justice, morality, and accepting or rejecting one achievement's outcome. This is what is meant by the term "accomplishment," so familiarity with the term is essential, "the Rector remarked.

USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) once more awarded students and professors at the "Students Achievement and Lecturers Best Advisor Awarding Night 2022." Sunday (19/12/2022) 's event took place at the USU Auditorium.

In 2022, USU accomplished numerous accomplishments. The invitation list for the awards ceremony included 810 USU students. The achievements of USU students span 383 areas, spanning from national to international levels.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si stated that the institution's accomplishments had increased from the previous year. The Rector praised the students and supervisors on their success.

"I would like to begin by congratulating the students and supervisors who have enhanced the value or amount. Student achievement has increased from last year to this year; thus, let's praise, "said Muryanto Amin.

In his remarks, the Rector referred to many modifications to evaluating student performance. According to the Rector, success teaches about the ability to defend fair ideas and everything associated with competition, so success should be familiarized.

The Awarding Night is an event that the institution must conduct to recognize the work of achievement-oriented students and faculty. Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe, SE, M.Si, director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, stated that these accomplishments are significant proof for enhancing KPI and university accreditation.

"Yes, this awarding night must exist; it is a form of university recognition for the work of students from the achievement sector, where it serves as proof for ranking both KPI and accreditation," said Doli.

Therefore, the Director of Ditmawalumni wants USU students to boost their accomplishments in competencies held by the Ministry, given that USU students predominantly compete in non-ministry contests.

Ditmawalumni has established patterns and programs for students to compete in the Ministry's highest-level competition.

"We anticipate that these students will be able to engage in eco-friendly contests. We are weak in many competitions organized by the Ministry. Still, on the other hand, students are more likely to enter events that the Ministry does not organize. While it is obvious that what we are seeking and concentrating on is the Ministry, we expect that next year all students will be able to participate in tiered competitions by following the ditmawa-designed patterns and programs, "he stated.

Muhammad Ayman Ashari is an outstanding Business Administration Study Program student at Usu. In August of last year, as a member of USU Silat Prestasi, he won the gold medal at the Indonesia Pakubumi Open International Championship. According to Ayman, there is no instant method for achieving success, as success can only be attained by practicing diligently, persistently, and with the assistance of prayer.

"Certainly, you must practice diligently, engage in constant practice, and pray for your parents. If I consider it, nothing is instantaneous, it must be fixed, and if it fails, we must try again until we achieve satisfactory results, "said Ayman.
