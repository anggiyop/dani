Alhamdulillah, this is a form of appreciation from BKKBN because we initiated the formation of the PTPK Consortium, which in its programs then synergizes with BKKBN in overcoming population problems or problems in Indonesia, "said Prof. Mury.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) won an award as a university that cares about population from the National Population and Family Planning Agency (BKKBN) 2023.

The award was directly received by USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, SSos, MSi, at the peak of the commemoration of National Family Day / Hari Keluarga Nasional (Harganas), Banyuasin, South Sumatra, Tuesday (4/7/2023).

USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin explained that the award from the Central BKKBN was an appreciation because USU was considered the initiator of the formation of the Consortium of Population Care Universities (PTPK) in Indonesia.

"Alhamdulillah, this is a form of appreciation from BKKBN because we initiated the formation of the PTPK Consortium, which in its programs then synergizes with BKKBN in overcoming population problems or problems in Indonesia," he said.

Prof Mury explained one of the focuses of the PTPK Consortium's work program focuses on stunting. In addition to the stunting problem, three other focuses are efforts to eliminate extreme poverty, the grand design of development and population (GDPK), and sustainable development efforts based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

"So universities are present to provide solutions through strategic programs in service and research schemes by the principles of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education to overcome these four problems," said Prof Mury.

BKKBN itself, in the context of implementing the family development, population, and family planning program (Bangga Kencana) and accelerating stunting reduction, conducts a partnership network with cross-sectors in a Penta helix manner, one of which is with university partners.

BKKBN and Kemenristekditi then held a Kick-Off Meeting for the Consortium Formation at UNS in November 2022, which 11 universities in Indonesia attended.

Through this forum, the Rector of Sebelas Maret University (UNS) was elected as the Chair of the PTPK Consortium, the Vice Chair of PTPK was the Rector of Universitas Hasanuddin , and the Secretary of the PTPK Consortium was the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Muryanto Amin.

Universities that are members of the PTPK Consortium include Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS), Universitas Indonesia (UI), Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB), Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), Universitas Padjajaran (UNPAD), Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Universitas Hasanuddin (UNHAS), Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (UNY), Universitas Tadulako, Universitas Negeri Padang, and Universitas Mulawarman.
