This research provides new insights into how Sarekat Islam utilized various methods and strategies to influence social and political life in East Sumatra. Their success in garnering support through the media and the struggle for workers' rights provides valuable lessons on how socio-political organizations can utilize the media to achieve their goals.

Many stories have yet to be fully revealed behind the glitter of Indonesia's independence struggle. One is the important role of Sarekat Islam (SI) in East Sumatra through the Benih Mardeka press movement, which is often forgotten in mainstream history books. The research written by Agustono and colleagues from the Universitas Sumatera Utara and Junaidi from Universitas Gadjah Mada will take readers through the hidden side of Sarekat Islam's struggle in this region, revealing how they left a deep imprint through several research methods.

This research uses the historical method, which consists of four stages: heuristics, criticism, interpretation, and historiography. Heuristics were used for document collection, such as official government documents and reports as primary sources. Secondary sources were newspapers such as Benih Mardeka, Soeara Djawa, and Sumatra Post. After data collection and verification, internal and external criticism of the findings was conducted. Therefore, the data is interpreted so that it is narrated in historiography.

The early press movement in East Sumatra was not as big as the similar movement in Java in the 1910s. Sumatran press movements started by natives and Chinese, such as Pewarta Deli and Andalas, did not publish many articles about native welfare, public education, and social justice. These newspapers were more commercial in nature. However, the subsequent press movement in East Sumatra developed more nationalist. The rapid mobility of people and information led to the emergence of a national identity and a sense of being a nation due to the use of Malay (Indonesian) as the language of writing.

The press movement in East Sumatra found its momentum in the emergence of nationalist ideas among various organizations. The emergence of issues related to economic inequality and social problems became the subject of debate in the Sumatran press world as two camps formed, one supporting the colonial government and plantation companies and the other supporting public interest and justice.

In 1916, a newspaper called Benih Mardeka was established. This newspaper was formed to pay attention to the social and political conditions of the Dutch East Indies, especially East Sumatra. This newspaper can be considered a tool or organ of Sarekat Islam in East Sumatra. This is not explicitly stated. However, the newspaper published a lot of news about Sarekat Islam. This is probably because most of Benih Mardeka's editors were important figures in the organization. The first main editor was Mohamad Samin, a Minang commissioner of Sarekat Islam of East Sumatra.

Benih Mardeka reported on Sarekat Islam congresses and the problems of plantation workers in East Sumatra in the early 20th century. They focused on the poor conditions of contract workers, the legal issues faced by Sarekat Islam members, and the struggle for workers' rights, such as the abolition of forced labor and improved welfare. The newspaper worked closely with various organizations to publicize change demands and fight for workers' justice.

The central figure in Sarekat Islam in East Sumatra was Mohamad Samin, a leader who played a key role in expanding the organization's influence. Mohamad Samin was the bridge between Sarekat Islam in Java and Sumatra. His leadership brought fresh air to the struggle, making it more effective in East Sumatra. Mohamad Samin was known as a figure who focused not only on politics but also on socio-economic empowerment. His courage to speak out against social and economic injustice solidified his role as a reform pioneer in the region.

Through its various activities and policies, Sarekat Islam played an important role in voicing labor rights, fighting for fair land distribution, and against exploitative practices that harmed the people. They utilized public forums, such as meetings and congresses, to discuss and push for change. By focusing on issues of social injustice and oppression, Benih Mardeka became an important symbol in the Indonesian independence movement, giving voice to the people and promoting social change in East Sumatra.

This research reveals the uniqueness and novelty that has not been widely known. One of them is how Sarekat Islam integrated political struggle with social and economic issues. Key findings include Mohamad Samin's role as a liaison between Java and Sumatra and the effective media strategy to promote Sarekat Islam's agenda.

One aspect that is interesting to study is Sarekat Islam's success in using newspapers to convey ideas and mobilize support. The research also highlights how Sarekat Islam focused on workers' rights and social reform, showing that their struggle was not only limited to political independence but also involved deep social change.

This research provides new insights into how Sarekat Islam utilized various methods and strategies to influence social and political life in East Sumatra. Their success in garnering support through the media and the struggle for workers' rights provides valuable lessons on how socio-political organizations can utilize the media to achieve their goals.

This research also highlights the importance of understanding the social and economic context of the struggle for independence. By looking at how Sarekat Islam dealt with social and economic injustice at the local level, we can better understand the complexity of the independence struggle, which involved various aspects of people's lives.
