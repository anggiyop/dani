"I really support the achievement of the main objective of this project, which is to develop a curriculum," said the Rector.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) welcomes the Spirit Erasmus+ Sport and Physical Education program as a Vehicle for Inclusion and Recognition in India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The event, which was attended by representatives from Sri Lanka and India Universities, took place in the Senate Meeting Room of the USU Central Administration Building on Thursday (16/06/2022).

In his remarks, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si expressed his gratitude and welcomed the participants in this program. The Rector also strongly supports the achievement of this program's main objective, namely establishing a curriculum.

"I support the achievement of the main objective of this project, which is to develop a curriculum," said the rector.

Chairman of the Spirit Erasmus+ Committee Prof. Dr. dr. Dina K. Sari, M.Gizi., Sp.GK said that this program aims to develop a curriculum that can improve sports and proper nutrition for students.

"The program that we carry out is to form or compile a curriculum that will later be able to provide improvements and a new curriculum for students, of course, to be able to improve in sports and also proper nutrition," he said.

He also added that the curriculum could be socialized and help to prevent chronic diseases in the future.

In addition to the curriculum, Spirit Erasmus+ will also work together to develop a Long Live Learning curriculum. In this curriculum, students can study during their lifetime and then form accredited courses.

"Where long live learning is where students can learn throughout their lives, then this also results in collaboration so that accredited courses are formed abroad as well as in Indonesia," explained Prof. Dinah.

Later, in addition to the ongoing curriculum preparation, there will also be joint research that will be carried out by universities that are members of Spirit Erasmus+. As additional information, in the Erasmus program, USU works with three universities in Europe, one from Cyprus, Portugal, and Spain. In Asia, there are universities in Sri Lanka and India.
