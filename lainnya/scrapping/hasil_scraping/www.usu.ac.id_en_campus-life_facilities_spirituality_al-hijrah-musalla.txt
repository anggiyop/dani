Al-Hijrah Musalla

The Al-Hijrah Musalla was inaugurated on May 3, 2019, by the former period's Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Runtung Sitepu, S.H., M.Hum. This musalla is located within the premises of the USU Faculty of Public Health (FKM USU). This musalla is accessible to both the USU academic community and the surrounding community during its opening hours. Students usually use the musalla and its courtyard to find tranquility and also perform their worship.
