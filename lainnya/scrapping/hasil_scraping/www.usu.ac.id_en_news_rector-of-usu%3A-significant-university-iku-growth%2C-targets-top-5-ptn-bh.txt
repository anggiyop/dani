"Because we have only been working on it for one year, we will continue to monitor it in the future," said the Chancellor.

PR USU—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a meeting on “Consolidation of TA Work Program Planning. 2022 and 2023” to increase the achievement of Key Performance Indicators (IKU) and International Accreditation and accelerate towards a World Class University (WCU). Leaders from all units and faculties attended the meeting at the USU Auditorium on Tuesday (15/03/2022).

In his presentation, USU's Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si, said that the achievement of the IKU at USU has experienced significant growth. USU has also been ranked 10th out of 12 other PTN-BH.

"Because we have only been working on it for one year, we will continue to monitor it in the future," said the Chancellor.

The Rector targets USU to be in the top 5 KPIs of PTN-BH. Efforts to increase IKU will be carried out through program strengthening. According to him, the main focus at this time is IKU 2 regarding Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) and IKU 8 regarding international study programs.

"For MBKM, curriculum integration will be carried out, and curriculum learning methods will be adjusted. Then the study program will also be accompanied to get international accreditation," he said.

Dr. Muryanto Amin also said that lecturers, education staff, and students played an important role in improving the IKU. Students can do this by participating in MBKM, diligently doing absolute community service, and completing tracer studies after graduation. "All programs made by the study program are important for students, and when they graduate, information about their work and income is immediately conveyed through tracer studies," he said.

For World Class University, there will be organizational strengthening, program substance strengthening, and monitoring based on achievement data.

This event was also filled with presentations by Germany's Country Representative of Senior Experten Service (SES), Adam Pamma, with the topic "FIBAA International Accreditation," and the Head of the UGM Quality Assurance Office, Prof. Indra Wijaya Kusuma, with the topic "Managing International Accreditation for Study Programs (Best Practice UGM)."
