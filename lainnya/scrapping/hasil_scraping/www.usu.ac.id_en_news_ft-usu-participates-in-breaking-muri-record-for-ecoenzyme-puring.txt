“Today, 1,000 liters of ecoenzyme were poured into the USU Library pond by the Faculty of Engineering freshmen. We hope that what we have done today will contribute to improving environmental quality. This coincides with the event organized by UI Green Metric to break the MURI record for the most participating universities,” said Prof. Renita Manurung.

MEDAN-PR – The Faculty of Engineering at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) participated in an ecoenzyme pouring event, contributing to a MURI Record alongside other universities across Indonesia. The event, organized by the UI Green Metric Green Campus Ranking Team, coincided with Indonesia’s Independence Day celebration on Saturday, Aug. 17, 2024. The activity was held during the second day of USU's new student orientation (PKKMB) at the USU Library pond on Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2024.

 

The ecoenzyme pouring, conducted by the 2024 freshmen of the Faculty of Engineering, was attended by Dr. Eng Ir Hafizhul Khair AM, S.T., M.T., Head of USU Green Campus Team; Prof. Dr. Ir Renita Manurung, M.T., Vice Dean I of the Faculty of Engineering; and Dr. Ir. Rahmi Karolina, S.T., M.T., IPM, GP, Head of the PKKMB Faculty of Engineering.

This coincides with the event organized by UI Green Metric to break the MURI record for the most participating universities,” said Prof. Renita Manurung.

 

Dr. Ir Rahmi Karolina, Head of the PKKMB Faculty of Engineering, explained, "In the PKKMB curriculum released by the ministry, there is indeed material on environmental awareness and healthy campuses. As a direct application, we not only focus on indoor material but also apply it in ecoenzyme production, specifically by the Environmental Engineering program. Ecoenzyme is produced through the fermentation of vegetable and fruit waste, which can filter water, hence it is poured into the pond."

 

The freshmen involved in the activity expressed their happiness at being able to contribute to creating a healthier and cleaner environment. Through the PKKMB material, they gained an understanding of how ecoenzymes are made and applied. (RJ)
