USU PUBLIC RELATION - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Hospital received medical device assistance from a High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC). Breathing devices commonly used for Covid-19 patients.

USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., who symbolically received the five HFNC devices worth Rp 495 millions, thanked PT. Sari Incofood Corporation or known as Indocafe for providing the devices.

"So, I also read about what HFNC is, it turns out this is a breathing devices developed by LIPI (Indonesian Science Institute)," he said Monday 7/5/2021) during the delivery of breathing devices in the USU Hospital Hall.

HFNC is a method of high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT). HFOT is one of the non-invasive methods that can be used to help the breathing of Covid-19 positive patients in the early stages.

One way to deliver high-flow oxygen to patients is to use a nasal cannula, therefore a device that works using the HFOT principle is often referred to as a High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC).

HFNC itself can relieve Covid-19 patients who have symptoms of shortness of breath. Thus, the symptoms of shortness of breath in Covid-19 patients will not worsen until they have to use a ventilator as a breathing devices. As a result, the number of Covid-19 patients who experience respiratory failure and eventually die can be reduced.

The Rector hoped that the presence of this tool could improve USU Hospital services, which currently have undergone many changes.

"I ask that this tool be used properly to serve the community and maintenance of this tool should also be carried out regularly," he said.

Director of USU Hospital, Dr. Henry Salim Siregar, explained that with the help of this device, USU Hospital's services will certainly increase. "We can more optimally serve Covid-19 patients. The aid has been submitted previously, and the USU Hospital team of doctors has also learned how to use it," he said.

He also explained that the tool is currently being used by Covid-19 patients who are currently being treated at USU Hospital.

PT Sari Incofood Corporation representative, Saleh Luo, in his speech said that the HFNC breathing apparatus is expected to be able to reduce the number of Covid-19 in North Sumatra, especially Medan.

"This is our contribution and we hope that we pray together that the Covid-19 outbreak will end soon. Hopefully, these devices can provide benefits, especially for curing Covid-19 patients," he said.

Also, attending the event were Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, Vice Rector II, M. Arifin Nasution, MSP, and Vice Rector IV, Prof. Opim Salim Sitompul, Directors of USU Hospital and Representatives of PT. Sari Incofood Corporation (YH-©ULC).
