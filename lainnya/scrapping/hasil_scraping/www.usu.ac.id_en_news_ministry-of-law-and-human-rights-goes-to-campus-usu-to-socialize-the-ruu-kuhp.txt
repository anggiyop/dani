“The participants of the socialization are expected to get the right understanding, description and good, balanced, constructive and critical thinking about the existence of the Criminal Code,” said the Rector of USU.

USU PR - The Ministry of Law and Human Rights (Kemenkumham) visited the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) to socialize the Draft Criminal Code (RUU KUHP) to the public. Titled “Kumham Goes to Campus”, this activity was carried out at the USU Auditorium on Thursday, (13/10/2022).

 

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Siber thanked the Ministry of Law and Human Rights for entrusting USU as the organizer of Kumham Goes to Campus.

 

The Rector hopes that the socialization participants will get a good understanding, as well as constructively and critically respond to the existence of the RUU KUHP. The Rector appealed to take advantage of this opportunity as a positive educational medium to share information and discuss the RUU KUHP.

 

“The participants of the socialization are expected to be able to get a correct understanding, a good, balanced, constructive and critical picture and thought of the existence of the Criminal Code,” said the Rector of USU.

 

The RUU KUHP is a draft law prepared to update the Criminal Code derived from the Wetboek van Srafrecht voor Nederlandsch while adjusting the politics of law, circumstances, and developments in the life of the nation and state today.

 

Therefore, Deputy Minister of Law and Human Rights (Wamenkumham) Eddy O.S. Hiariej said that Indonesian President Joko Widodo, at a limited meeting held (02/08/2022) instructed the ranks of government to conduct a massive public dialog regarding the RUU KUHP.

 

So that later the dialog will bring up some input regarding the RUU KUHP which can be considered and discussed by the DPR during the session.

 

“Today we get constructive input related to the RUU KUHP, and we will consider including it in the explanation of the RUU KUHP,” said Eddy when interviewed by the press.

 

This activity makes students the main target audience with the aim of capturing student aspirations on the RUU KUHP because students are critical and idealistic elements of the nation that need to absorb their aspirations.

 

“Students are agents of change who can drive change towards a better order of life,” he said.

 

According to one of the speakers of Kumham Goes to Campus, Professor of Criminal Law UGM Prof. Marcus Priyo Gunarto, in this socialization, conveyed the perception and background contained in the RUU KUHP to students because there are many paradigms underlying the law.

 

“There are many backgrounds that underlie the formulation of the RUU KUHP, so it is hoped that there will be a common view and then a meeting point regarding what things are not in accordance with their aspirations,” explained Prof. Marcus.

 

On the same occasion, USU Criminal Law Expert Dr. Mahmud Mulyadi SH, M.Humm conveyed that the RUU KUHP talks about the harmony of individuals with the State which is based on actions with the perpetrators. Then about the balance between humans and nature which is adapted from customs. So that if disharmony occurs, the community is also responsible for restoring the harmony.

 

“The concept is that the crime does not only involve the perpetrator and the victim, due to the crime the community is also unlucky. Therefore the community is responsible for restoring the disturbed balance,” said Dr. Mahmud.

 

For information, Kumham Goes to Campus not only aims to socialize the RUU KUHP but also presents public services within the Ministry of Law and Human Rights that are needed by students. Reportedly Kumham Goes to Campus will be carried out in 5 universities and USU is the first campus visited by Kumham.
