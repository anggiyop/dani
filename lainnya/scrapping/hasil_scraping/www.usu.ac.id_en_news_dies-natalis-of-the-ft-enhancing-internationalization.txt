So today, we gather all lecturers, staff, students, and alumni to have one determination for a better future together,” says Prof. Fahmi.

USU PR- The Faculty of Engineering (FT) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) successfully celebrated its 64th Dies Natalis, themed “Enhance The Future” on Friday-Saturday (12/15-16/23).

Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM, said that choosing “Enhance The Future” as this year's Dies Natalis theme is a harbinger for a continually changing future. He said that today’s Funwalk activity is hoped to be a forum to strengthen ties among lecturers, educational staff, students, and alumni at FT.

“So today, we gather all lecturers, staff, students, and alumni to have one determination for a better future together,” says Prof. Fahmi.

The Dean of FT also expressed his hope for the Faculty of Engineering next year to further enhance the internationalization pursued by the university. FT has reached international standards in terms of facilities, curriculum, and accreditation.

However, so far, no foreign students have been studying directly at FT. Therefore, the Dean of FT hopes that the international atmosphere at FT can be further enhanced in 2024.

“So in 2024, we will have more foreign students in the faculty of engineering. People will come to the faculty of engineering and feel its international atmosphere is increasingly felt,” says Prof. Fahmi.

This activity also launched the 13th Lustrum and the 65th Dies FT Logo in 2024.
