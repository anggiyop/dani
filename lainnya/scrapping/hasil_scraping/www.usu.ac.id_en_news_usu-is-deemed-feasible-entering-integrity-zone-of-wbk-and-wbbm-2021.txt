Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is deemed feasible entering Corruption-Free Territorial Integrity Zone and Clean and Serving Bureaucracy Area (ZI-WBK/WBBM).

This is based on the outcome of evaluation and assessment carried out by Internal Assessment Team of Integrity Zone Development 2021.

In the letter signed by the Inspectorate General Dr. Chatarina Mauliana, SH, SE, MH, USU is included in 92 working units which are feasible and ready to be proposed to have the predicate of WBK and WBBM.

“Of the 167 assessed, 92 of them are eligible for submission, whilst 75 others are not ready to be proposed,” the letter reads.

Rector of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin, who is interviewed on Monday, (7/26) said that bureaucracy reform in university area is the responsibilities of all working units within the university.

“Winning or not later on is not the problem. Because bureaucratic reform must be carried out” Mury said, who previously served as USU’s Head of Bureaucratic Reform

According to Dr. Mury, USU needs a momentum to perform changes. The assessment of ZI-WBK/WBBM from the Inspectorate General is the fortunate momentum to work on the bureaucracy in USU.

Chair of Bureaucratic Reform Team, Dr. Nurman Achmad, said that USU’s Faculty of Nurse (FKep) will be proposed to achieve ZI-WBK/WBBM predicate.

“USU FKep is expected to get ZI WBK and furthermore FKep will be made as a pilot project in implementing integrity zone within university environment,” he said.

Dr. Nurman said that the Rector of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin is committed to implement bureaucratic reform by inaugurating Rector’s Expert Staff for Bureaucratic Reform and Public Service departments and implementing the integrity zone in USU marked by the launching of One-Stop Application (ASA), Whistle Blower System, E-office, Agenda and Faculty of Public Relation.
