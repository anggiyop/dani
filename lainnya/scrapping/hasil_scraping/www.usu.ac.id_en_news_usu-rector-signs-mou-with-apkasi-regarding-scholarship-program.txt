In his statement, the USU Rector explained that the signing was the result of an audience discussion between Apkasi and the rector regarding Apkasi's partnership with universities in the domestic scholarship program.

“USU, together with 20 other universities, signed a cooperation agreement to provide scholarships. This cooperation is also a tangible manifestation of collaboration between universities and local governments,” said Prof. Mury.

The Rector appreciated the cooperation between Apkasi and the rectors of 20 universities in Indonesia. Because according to him it will have a significant impact in a sustainable human resource development program.

Besides USU, several leading universities also signed the cooperation, including STAN, UGM, UI, ITB, IPB, Unpad, Undip, Unibraw, UNS, UPI, UNJ, Unes, Unimal, UNM, Unsoed, and others.

The signing was part of the National Symposium activities with the theme “Realizing Healthy and Superior Human Resources through State University Partnerships in the 2500 Regional Scholarship Program to Welcome Golden Indonesia 2045”.

The Minister of State Apparatus Empowerment and Bureaucratic Reform, Abdullah Azwar Anas, who was the keynote speaker at the National Symposium, highlighted the importance of improving the quality of human resources to explore regional potential.

Cooperation between Apkasi and universities is seen as an important step in improving the quality of human resources and supporting sustainable development in Indonesia.

“This event is not only a momentum for MoU signing but also a valuable platform for stakeholders.
