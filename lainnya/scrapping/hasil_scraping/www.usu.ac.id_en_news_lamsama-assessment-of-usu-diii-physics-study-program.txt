"The leadership of the Universitas Sumatera Utara appreciates the achievements that have been achieved so far by USU's F-MIPA Physics Study Program, which hopefully can continue to be improved," he said.

HUMAS USU - Lamsama (Independent Accreditation Institute for Natural Sciences and Formal Sciences) conducted an accreditation field assessment for the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Physics Diploma III Study Program. Bringing in two teams of Lamsama assessors, Prof. Dr. Ing Setyawan Purnomo Sakti, M.Eng from Brawijaya University as assessor I and Dr. Ir.

USU Deputy Rector IV for Information, Planning and Development Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc in his remarks representing USU's Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si welcomed the arrival of the Lamsama assessor team and appreciated the achievement of USU's D-III Physics Study Program which has been accredited Very Good until February 2023.

"The leadership of the Universitas Sumatera Utara appreciates the achievements that have been achieved so far by USU's F-MIPA Physics Study Program, which hopefully can continue to be improved," he said.

According to WR IV, the field assessment of USU's D-III Physics Study Program aims to improve the implementation of the Tri Dharma of higher education. It is hoped that in this assessment, USU's D-III Physics Study Program can receive assessor input so that it can successfully add to the ranks of superior accredited study programs at USU.

"The goal is for this study program to be better at implementing the three Tri Dharma, both in education, maybe also research, and community service," Prof. Opim explained.

Dean of FMIPA USU, Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu. M.Sc said that the field assessment carried out by Lamsama was to obtain superior accreditation for USU D-III Physics study program. Therefore, the Dean of USU's FMIPA hopes that the entire assessment process will run smoothly, especially the form preparation team for both PPS and study programs are able to explain the matters asked by the assessors.

"Today until tomorrow is a field assessment for diploma III in Physics, where currently the accreditation is very good, of course with these two days we hope that according to the wishes of the leadership also to obtain or achieve superior accreditation," the Dean of USU FMIPA said.

USU Dean of the Vocational Faculty, Prof. Dr. Isfenti Sadalia SE, ME added that the assessment of USU D-III Physics Study Program is useful in evaluating how the tri dharma is implemented considering that USU' D-III Physics will transform into an applied undergraduate when it becomes part of the Vocational Faculty.

"We really want to see what the implementation looks like for the transformation which is 30 percent theory 70 percent practice, and also later seen from surveys, from education, in the world of work so what the wishes for D-III Physics alumni are, do they prefer D3 or D4 only then will he be transformed into an applied scholar,” Prof. Isfenti explained.
