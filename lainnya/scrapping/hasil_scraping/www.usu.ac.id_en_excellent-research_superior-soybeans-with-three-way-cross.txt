The three-way crossbreeding technique creates superior soybean varieties that are more productive and climate-resilient. This innovation supports food security and the sustainability of future agriculture.

Behind the tempeh and tofu dishes we enjoy daily lies a long journey from a soybean seed to a rich and delicious source of protein. However, despite its popularity, soybean production faces significant challenges for farmers and agricultural researchers. Changing climates, declining soil quality, and pest attacks are real threats impacting global soybean production. The growing demand for food emphasizes the urgent need for innovation to ensure soybeans remain a reliable and accessible food source.

To address this challenge, a research team from Universitas Sumatera Utara, consisting of D.S. Hanafiah, K. Lubis, Haryati, H. Setiado, G.M. Damanik, M.S. Limbong, F.R. Silaen, Joshua, and A. Lestami, conducted an important study to develop superior soybean varieties using a three-way crossbreeding technique. This technique not only increases genetic diversity but also paves the way for creating more resilient, productive, and adaptive soybean plants.

The research led by Hanafiah aims to enhance the genetic variability of soybeans, resulting in superior varieties capable of thriving in diverse environmental conditions. In this experiment, three soybean varieties were used: Grobogan, Anjasmoro, and Dega-1. Each variety has unique characteristics—Grobogan and Anjasmoro are known for their high productivity, while Dega-1 is recognized for its taller plants.

“By combining three superior varieties—Grobogan, Anjasmoro, and Dega-1—this study aims to create soybeans with the best traits of each parent. The goal is for these hybrid plants to grow well in various environmental conditions while producing nutrient-rich and abundant seeds,” explained Hanafiah.

The three-way crossbreeding method involves several specialized steps, including emasculation, artificial pollination, and isolation. Under controlled environments, researchers monitored every stage and factor that could influence the success of the crossbreeding process.

Various parameters were measured in this study, such as plant height, the number of pods, and the success rate of crossbreeding. The results showed that crossbreeding between Grobogan and Anjasmoro achieved a success rate of 57.14%. Meanwhile, the three-way crossbreeding involving the F1 generation (Grobogan × Anjasmoro) and Dega-1 showed a success rate of 35.37%.

“Interestingly, Dega-1 demonstrated the best growth potential, with taller plants and a higher number of pods. This indicates that Dega-1’s genetic factors play a crucial role in producing stronger and more productive plants,” said Hanafiah.

The success of this crossbreeding process depends on environmental conditions, genetic compatibility, and the expertise of the research team. One key factor is the optimal temperature, which ranges from 24–28°C, as this range enhances the success of pollination. Extreme weather—either too hot or too cold—can hinder the pollination process, resulting in empty pods.

The crossbreeding results revealed interesting variations in the number of productive pods, seeds per pod, and total seed weight. The crossbreeding between Grobogan and Anjasmoro produced pods and seeds with higher weight, primarily due to adequate nitrogen content in the soil. This is crucial since seed weight plays a significant role in determining yield.

“This study concludes that the three-way crossbreeding technique successfully increased genetic variability and soybean yield potential. The Grobogan × Anjasmoro cross proved to be the most effective, while the three-way crossbreeding shows promising potential for future breeding programs,” Hanafiah concluded.

With broader genetic diversity, these hybrid soybeans are expected to offer solutions for farmers facing agricultural challenges in the future. Further research and development in this field could soon make superior soybeans that are more productive and resilient to climate change a reality. This study highlights the importance of innovation in agriculture to ensure food security for future generations.
