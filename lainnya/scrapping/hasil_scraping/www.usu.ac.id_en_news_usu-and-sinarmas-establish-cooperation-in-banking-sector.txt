“I think we also need to collaborate on the best service to students, lecturers, and the academic community, said the USU Rector.”

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) signed a memorandum of understanding with PT Sinar Mas Agro Resources and Technology Tbk. This cooperation will be related to cooperation in the tridharma area in the context of organizing education, study, research, and community service. The memorandum of understanding between the two parties took place at the USU Rector's Audience Room, on Tuesday (20/08/2024).

 

This signing will be implemented through a more detailed cooperation agreement with the two faculties directly involved, namely the Faculty of Agriculture and Engineering, especially in facilitating the exchange of information, data, and knowledge in terms of scientific development in the upstream to downstream sectors of oil palm plantations.

 

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., welcomed the implementation of the cooperation that will be established to share and provide benefits. It is hoped that there will be collaboration and contribution for both institutions.

 

“I think we also need to collaborate on the best service to students, lecturers, and the academic community,” said the USU Rector.

 

Head of HR CBS, Lilianawati, said that USU was chosen to cooperate because some of its alumni are already working at PT Sinarmas. She also added that the internship students are in accordance with their fields, such as agronomy.

 

“Because many USU alumni work at Sinarmas. We want to establish broader cooperation so that it will be reciprocal,” he added.

 

Furthermore, Ricky Delimarta, Head of HR Upstream PT Sinar Mas Agro Resources and Technology Tbk, hopes that the cooperation that is being established will be even closer. University and industry cooperation in the future will build Indonesia through business economics and banking.

 

“In this case, of course, it is possible, and we can build Indonesia. We build Indonesia together through economic development through business banking,” he hoped.
