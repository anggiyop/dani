The higher education curriculum is a series of plans and structures that regulate the content, learning materials, teaching methods, and assessment processes that guide the implementation of academic activities at higher education institutions. The curriculum includes structured graduate competency standards, including core, supporting, and additional competencies that support the achievement of educational goals, implementation of the institution mission, and realization of the vision of the study program. In it, there is a list of courses, modules, or learning blocks that support the development of graduate competencies, provide flexibility for students to explore their interests, and are accompanied by descriptions, syllabi, learning plans, and evaluation instruments.

The curriculum is planned with attention to relevance to educational objectives, depth and breadth of material, and arrangements that encourage the development of “hard skills” and “soft skills” that can be applied in various academic and professional contexts and situations. The requirements for completing the Study Program education depend on the strata taught. For more information, please contact the relevant study program.
