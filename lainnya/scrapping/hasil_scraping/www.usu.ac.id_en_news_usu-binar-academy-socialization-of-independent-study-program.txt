"Technology acceleration in various fields, which is currently unstoppable, requires hard work and the willingness of all of us to keep learning," the USU Rector said.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) together with Binar Academy disseminate information to USU students regarding the independent study program at Binar Academy. The activity was held through a Zoom meeting, Wednesday (1/19/2022).

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said, in its academic services, Binar Academy offers a variety of soft skill and hard skill materials with a digital approach that is very useful and in line with current world developments.

Various course programs available at Binar Academy include learning Business Intelligence Engineering, Android Engineering, Product Management, Business Intelligence Analysis, Full Stack Web Development and UI/UX Research & Design.

"Technology acceleration in various fields, which is currently unstoppable, requires hard work and willingness from all of us to keep learning," he said.

The Rector added that the independent study program at Binar Academy can improve technical skills for students, related to the demands of the business world for the availability of human resources that are ready to use and have relationships commensurate with industry needs.

"This can be a place for students to update and improve their abilities," he said.

According to Dr. Muryanto, the world offers challenges that are so complex, but also accompanied by great opportunities that can only be grasped and responded to well by those who are prepared. High skills and high competency are the main demands addressed to the younger generation to welcome Indonesia Gold 2045.

"The learning process that continues in various dimensions of life, must be continuously followed by commitment and perseverance," he added.

He hopes that this socialization is an important forum that is used not only as a medium for sharing information that will provide education and enlightenment to all participants, but also can provide motivation for all participants to add new knowledge and abilities in increasing their capacity.
