“Creativity and competitiveness are the main keys in facing challenges in the world of work. I hope USU graduates can continue to develop and become leaders in their respective fields,” he added.

 

Public Relations USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a degree inauguration for Period II graduates for the 2024/2025 Academic Year as a form of appreciation for the academic achievements of students who have completed their studies. It took place hybrid at the USU Auditorium and YouTube streaming, on Friday-Saturday (07-08/02/2025).

 

USU graduated 1,500 graduates from various faculties and educational levels during this period. With this addition, the total number of USU graduates to date has reached 250,000 people, who have taken part in various fields and contributed to society.

 

In his speech themed “Education Teaches How to Think and Learn to Provide Solutions”, USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., expressed his pride to all graduates who have successfully completed their higher education. He emphasized that this success is not the end, but the beginning of a new journey in life.

 

“Today is a historic moment in your life. The academic degree achieved is a personal achievement and a mandate to devote knowledge to society and the nation,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

In line with that, the USU Rector emphasized that graduates must continue to hone their skills and not rely solely on diplomas. According to him, the world of work now demands creativity, flexibility, and the ability to adapt to change.

 

“Creativity and competitiveness are the main keys in facing challenges in the world of work. I hope USU graduates can continue to develop and become leaders in their respective fields,” he added.

 

This graduation ceremony celebrates academic success and provides momentum for reflecting on the role of USU graduates in the professional world. The USU Rector also reminded attendees that success is not only determined by academic achievement but also by character and the ability to manage challenges in the competitive world of work.

 

“Don't be afraid to fail. From failure, you will learn to rise and become stronger,” he said.

 

As part of the wider academic community, USU graduates are expected to become agents of change who benefit the surrounding environment. The USU Rector reminded the graduates to maintain the good name of their alma mater and continue to contribute to society.

 

“As USU alumni, you have the responsibility to continue the spirit and values that have been instilled while here,” said Prof. Muryanto.

 

Not to forget, the USU Rector also emphasized the importance of adapting to technological developments and digitalization, which are now increasingly dominating various industrial sectors. He reminded graduates to not only use technology but also create innovations that can have a big impact on society.

 

“The world of work is changing rapidly. Don't just be a spectator, but be part of the change. Utilize technology to create new opportunities,” he added.

 

Among the thousands of graduates, one of those who celebrated this moment was Dastin Naufal, a graduate of the Accounting Study Program of the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) USU. Dastin shared the experiences and challenges he faced during his studies. Since the beginning of college, Dastin has had to face the obstacle of the long distance between home and campus. To overcome this, she implemented a strict time management strategy to do well in college.

 

“The long distance between my house and campus was challenging. But with good time management, I always try to arrive early and prepare everything well,” she said.

 

Dastin Naufal also shared some memorable experiences during college, including the opportunity to go to Bengkulu with a lecturer on an academic project. In closing, Dastin gave a message to students who are still struggling to complete their studies.

 

“I never imagined I could have this kind of experience. In addition to adding insight, I can also build relationships with professionals in the accounting field,” he added.

 

With the graduates' enthusiasm and achievements, it is hoped that they can become a generation of future leaders who are innovative and ready to face global challenges.
