The USU Rector appealed to all test takers not to use fraudulent means to pass. "UTBK is a test of honesty, about how our nation's children compete not only about intelligence and graduation. This UTBK is a test of patience and a test of honesty, which can have many impacts when he later undergoes lectures. We hope that all participants will follow the competition in accordance with the existing regulations, because if they cheat, it will not provide much benefit for themselves. This is about character, because character will be an important part that determines, not just academic matters," he said.

 

Public Relations USU – Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) began the implementation of the 2025 National Selection Test-Based Computer-Based Written Test (UTBK-SNBT), on Wednesday (23/4/2025), which opened at 06.45 WIB. UTBK-SNBT 2025 at USU was attended by 38,133 participants spread across three exam locations, consisting of 36,491 participants at USU Medan, 761 participants in Gunungsitoli and 881 participants in Teluk Dalam.

 

This was conveyed by USU Rector, Prof Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, to print and electronic media journalists during the review of the implementation of UTBK-SNBT 2025, accompanied by Vice Rector I Prof Dr Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, Vice Rector II Dr Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos, M. SP, Vice Rector III Prof Dr Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, SSi, M.Si, Apt, Vice Rector V Dr Ir Luhut Sihombing, MP and Director of the Directorate of Education Development Ir Ikhsan Siregar, ST, M.Eng, Head of Public Relations, Promotion and Protocol Office Amalia Meutia, M.Psi, Psychologist, along with a number of other UTBK committees, Saturday (26/4/2025).

 

According to Prof. Muryanto Amin, the exam implementation, as he directly monitored until the 4th day, went according to the SOP, with both participants monitoring screens and the supervisor monitoring. The server for implementing question traffic from the central server to the USU server is also running well, and it is hoped that this can last until the last day of UTBK.

 

The number of UTBK participants at USU in 2025 has increased compared to the number of participants in the previous year. In 2024, there were 37,169 participants. UTBK-SNBT 2025 at USU was also attended by 1 participant with a disability, who is blind. The disabled participant took part in UTBK on the second day, Thursday (24/4/2025) at the location determined by the committee. Prof. Mury, who also acts as a member of the national committee, added that for all of Indonesia, there are around 700 participants with disabilities who take the UTBK.

Answering questions related to cheating, Prof. Mury explained that on the first day, cheating was found at UI, which then, in the afternoon, saw news of cheating practices in other UTBK centers, including USU. For all these cases, firm action was taken and processed by the police. He emphasized that the national UTBK committee, particularly USU, does not tolerate all forms of fraudulent practices committed by UTBK participants.

 

 

Yesterday at USU, there were several people whom we detained and examined because of indications of cheating. We found 7 jockeys from outside the region who used the identity of exam participants at USU and have been secured. They are indicated to have falsified their identities and used cameras in their glasses' frames. Meanwhile, in other locations outside USU, cheating was also found, whose cameras were in the bracelets and buttons of their clothes, so the metal detector did not detect them. The jockeys were examined, an official report was made, then reported to the police and detained. This is an important lesson for next year's implementation for the national committee, to make metal detectors more sensitive to various modes of fraud committed by participants or jockeys. We will take firm action against all cheating modes carried out by these participants/jockeys, "said Prof. Mury.

The USU Rector appealed to all test takers not to use fraudulent means to pass. "UTBK is a test of honesty, about how our nation's children compete not only about intelligence and graduation. This UTBK is a test of patience and a test of honesty, which can have many impacts when he later undergoes lectures. We hope that all participants will follow the competition in accordance with the existing regulations, because if they cheat, it will not provide much benefit for themselves. This is about character, because character will be an important part that determines, not just academic matters," he said.

 

UTBK will run until May 4, 2025, and the participants' graduation will be announced on May 28, 2025. It is held in two sessions, starting with session I, which runs from 06.45 to 10.30 WIB, and session II from 13.00 to 16.45 WIB. The schedule is exempted for UTBK session II, which takes place on Friday. It adjusts to the Friday prayer schedule, so it lasts from 13.45 to 17.30 WIB.

 

The exam locations are within USU and UTBK USU partners, with a total of 1,922 computers provided for participants, consisting of 1,585 computers at locations within Universitas Sumatera Utara, as well as 337 USU partner computers available at SMAN 1 Medan and Sari Mutiara University. Meanwhile, 108 computers have been provided for the exam locations at SMAN 1 Gunungsitoli and SMKN 1 Niasdalam. (RJ)
