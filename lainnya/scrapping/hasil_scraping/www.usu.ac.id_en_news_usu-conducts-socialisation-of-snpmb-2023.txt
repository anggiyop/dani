Muhammad Zulham, S.E., M.Si. hopes that this socialisation will change the community's mindset regarding the stereotype that 'lectures are only for those from well-off families'. He also added that the secondary school teachers who attended this activity could be responsible for delivering the material that has been presented about National Selection for New Student Admission (SNPMB).

HUMAS USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a socialisation and promotion about the 2023 National Selection for New Student Admission (SNPMB) in USU. The event was opened by the Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs of USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, at the Auditorium, Monday (13/03/2023).

This socialisation aims to explain the flow and requirements of the USU new student admission process. The Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations of USU Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe, S.E., M.Si. and the Head of USU Berau of Academic Affairs, Muhammad Zulham, S.E., M.Si, presented the material in this socialisation.

Responding to this activity, the Head of the Bureau of Academic Affairs of USU explained that USU is carrying out its function in terms of marketing the campus and responding to the community's needs.

“To emphasise more about the admission options offered and the requirements for them to enter USU,” said the Head of the USU Academic Bureau.

Not only about the selection process; this socialisation also discussed scholarships and the tuition fee system as a response to the economic constraints of prospective students.

“I also mentioned the KIP-K scholarship and other scholarships earlier to ensure that in alignment with what the government wants, there is no longer an excuse for not studying due to inability because the tuition fee responds to economic conditions,” Zulham explained.

Muhammad Zulham, S.E., M.Si. hopes that this socialisation will change the community's mindset regarding the stereotype that 'lectures are only for those from well-off families'. He also added that the secondary school teachers who attended this activity could be responsible for delivering the material that has been presented about National Selection for New Student Admission (SNPMB).

For information, in the 2023 New Student Admission, USU opens several channels, including National Selection Based on Achievement (SNBP), National Selection Based on Test (SNBT), University Selection (SMM), Diploma Programme Student Admission Selection (SPMPD), and Selection Based on Outstanding Achievement (SBPU). All information about new student admission can be accessed on USU's official website, https://www.usu.ac.id/id/penerimaan.
