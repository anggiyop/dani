USU PR - The Faculty of Public Health (FKM) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a series of 31st Anniversary celebrations with the theme “The Role of Public Health in Achieving SDGs”. The opening ceremony took place at the FKM Auditorium on Wednesday (11/12/2024).

In her remarks, USU Vice Rector III, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt. expressed her appreciation for FKM's contribution in the development of public health. With this theme, the anniversary is expected to not only be a moment of reflection, but also a concrete step to strengthen the role of FKM in achieving SDGs.

“FKM USU is 31 years old, a mature age to continue to contribute to realizing better public health,” said Prof. Poppy.

The Dean of FKM USU, Prof. Dr. Dra. Ida Yustina, M.Si, emphasized that the anniversary theme was chosen as FKM's commitment to the achievement of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targeted by 2030. She also expressed optimism about FKM's progress in the coming year.

“Opportunities for achievement, both at the national and international levels, are increasingly open. We will continue to encourage the improvement of key performance indicators provided by the university,” he added.

Chairman of the Anniversary Committee, Dr. Sri Malem Indirawati, SKM, M.Si, explained that this year's celebration involved various activities, ranging from competitions to community service. The event is a moment of reflection and motivation for the entire academic community to make public health science a tool to create a healthier, fairer, and more sustainable world.

“The series of events began on October 28 with launching activities. There were sports competitions, public speaking, scientific writing, and FKM Fun Walk. We also held a community service program with the support of CSR funds from PT Jasa Raharja,” he said.

Dr. Sri Malem added that this event also carries a culture program that includes gymnastics, fashion shows, and song performances by the Dean of FKM. She emphasized that this year, FKM USU focuses on health-related indicators, such as sanitation and equitable health access.
