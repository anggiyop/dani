About Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships

The Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships (Dit IKG) was established in 2022 based on the USU Board of Trustees Regulation No. 1 of 2022 concerning USU Organization and Governance. The purpose of establishing Dit IKG is to become a policy developer in optimizing cooperation and partnerships to realize internationalization within the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). Dit IKG is essential in mobilizing cooperation from the smallest unit level to the highest unit within the university. One of Dit IKG's achievements is to make USU the second-best (silver) winner in the Legal Entity State Universities (PTN-BH) category with the best international cooperation, an award given by the Directorate General of Higher Education, Research and Technology.
