According to the Rector, the enthusiasm of PMM participants for USU is very large; it can be seen from the massive number of PMM participants, namely 160 students from 33 cities and 63 universities spread throughout Indonesia.

The Rector of USU also thanked a number of universities for sending their students to take part in the 2022 USU PMM. And hoped that this collaboration could bring goodness and benefits both in improving the quality of Indonesian education and in contributing to human resource development.

"Hopefully this collaboration can bring goodness and benefits to all of us," he said.

Director of the Directorate of Educational Development Muhammad Anggia Muchtar ST., MMIT said, USU and PMM students had communicated and coordinated via whatsapp and zoom virtual meetings regarding the preparations that had to be made to attend lectures at USU.

Such as arranging KRS to the pick-up process. "So, two months ago, they had discussions in groups until finally yesterday they arranged the KRS together with the USU students as well," explained Anggia.

USU PMM Coordinator Muhammad Arif Lubis SE, M.Si explained, in addition to attending lectures as usual with USU students, especially for PMM participants, there is the Nusantara Module with a total of 4 credits. In this module, there will be introductory activities about North Sumatran culture as well as visiting a number of tourist spots in North Sumatra.

Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni of USU Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE., M.Sc. mentioned that PMM is an MBKM activity so that the academic process which will last for 6 months will be interspersed with other activities.

"It's like getting to know USU, Medan, getting to know North Sumatra and mingling with USU students who are also active at USU," he said.

For information, there are 9 faculties and 19 study programs at USU that offer courses for the PMM program. Among them are FISIP, FMIPA, FIB, FT, FH, FEB, FKEP, FKM, and FP. (©ULC)
