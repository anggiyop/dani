The topic discussed is Nutritional Supplement to Athletes which thoroughly discusses how nutritional supplements for athletes support the athlete's performance.

George Aphamis is a teaching staff at the University of Nicosia, Cyprus who is very expert in his field, he gives many discussions about supplements. Dietary supplements have a role in improving athlete performance, even though the effect is not that big. Food supplements that are consumed must be appropriate and in accordance with the rules, so that athletes get the benefits they want to achieve.

Actually, the nutritional needs of athletes can be met by maintaining a healthy diet or following a special diet according to everyone's needs. After all, no studies have proven that supplements for athletes are more effective than natural food and drink sources. Supplements for athletes may consist of various ingredients such as multivitamins, proteins, minerals, amino acids, or certain herbs. Usually a supplement will contain a combination of these ingredients. These supplements are available in tablet, capsule, liquid and powder form. The discussion of this type of supplement which has been thoroughly discussed by George Aphamis provides a new perspective for students about the importance of supplements for athletes who need optimal performance.
