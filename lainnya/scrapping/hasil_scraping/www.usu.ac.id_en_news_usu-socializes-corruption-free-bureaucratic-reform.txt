"We need to change our mindset, so that we don't work only on salary, but also carry out our responsibilities and services to the fullest," he said.

USU PR - Expert Staff of the Rector for Human Resources, Organization and Bureaucratic Reform Dr. Nurman Achmad S.Sos., M.Soc.Sc., gave a socialization regarding Bureaucratic Reform (RB) and the Corruption-Free Regional Integrity Zone (ZI WBK) to the cleaning staff at the USU Central Administration Bureau Building, Friday (3/25/2022) .

Dr. Nurman said that USU is currently moving towards bureaucratic reform and a corruption-free area, therefore understanding and support from all elements of USU are needed, including the cleaning staff. Bureaucratic reform is an effort to improve services, as well as cleaning staff must provide the best possible service when working.

"You are part of USU, so you have to understand what USU is currently doing," he said.

Dr. Nurman said, there are 6 levers in ZI WBK, one of which is change management that needs to be done to improve the mindset.

"We need to change our mindset, so that we don't work only on salary, but also carry out our responsibilities and services to the fullest," he said.

On that occasion, Dr. Nurman also said that cleaning staff have a role to play in realizing USU's vision and mission to become a university that has academic excellence. To achieve that, there is a value system for USU STAR TALENT.

“We all have to support the realization of USU's vision and mission, especially in this RB and ZI WBK. The Rector is very supportive and this is a special concern and must be implemented. This is for the good of USU too, I hope that all elements of USU support this goal," he explained.

He added that the entire academic community needs to be equipped with the RB and ZI WBK, after this there will also be socialization to lecturers, students, and security personnel. (©ULC)
