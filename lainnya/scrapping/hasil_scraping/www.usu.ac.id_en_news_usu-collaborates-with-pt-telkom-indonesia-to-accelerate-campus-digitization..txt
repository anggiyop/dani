"We plan several points for the digital area. Like a sports center, there will only be one access using a digital method that can be used for all facilities. In addition, we have also prepared the USU Information System Center (PSI), as well as the Kuala Bekala area as USU's two campuses to become a digital area," USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin said.

USU PR - Supporting campus digitization, USU is preparing to build digital areas at several points as a first step. In this effort, USU cooperates with various parties so that planning goes well.

One of them is the preparation of a digital area in collaboration with PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk. USU hopes that PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk can support the development of digital area infrastructure.

"We currently hope that cooperation can be realized to prepare digital areas at several points in the USU environment. With the existence of PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk, we are confident in its actions as a leading telecommunications company in Indonesia. We hope that the resources they have can contribute," said USU Rector, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S Sos, M Si, Monday (9/27/2021), in the Meeting Room of the USU Rector's Office.

The Rector also opened an offer to become a partner of Merdeka Learning Merdeka Campus with PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk.

He gave an example that several partners have collaborated to develop students through internship programs. He hopes that PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk can open up the same opportunities for USU students.

“Some of our partners have explored cooperation to be able to accept our students in an internship program at the company. We hope that PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk can also open this opportunity so that it will open up more opportunities for students to gain experience," he said.

The Rector of USU guarantees that students who will take part in the MBKM program will later be selected and adjusted to the criteria required by PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk. So that in the end it is hoped that PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk can maximize the potential of these students through employee recruitment.

General Manager of Telkom Witel Medan, Binsar Silalahi, stated that his party is ready to support the development of digital areas within USU.

“We are here to express our support and are ready to contribute to the development of higher education, especially USU. We prepare our resources to get directly involved in this effort. In addition, we also open cooperation in other fields that we can do," said Binsar.

Present at the meeting were Account Manager Sri Dwiningsih, and Government Service Manager Lyanie Novridha, USU Vice Rector III Dr Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S Si, M Si, Apt, and Head of Information System Center Muhammad Anggia Muchtar, ST, MMIT. (©ULC)
