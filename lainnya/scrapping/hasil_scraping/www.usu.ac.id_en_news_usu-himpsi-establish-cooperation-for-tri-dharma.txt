Prof. Poppy said that in the future there will be many Tri Dharma activities that HIMPSI can do with the Faculty of Psychology. Mainly activities supported universities' Main Performance Indicators (KPI), such as inviting teaching practitioners on campus, holding webinars or seminars, and conducting joint research with HIMPSI.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) collaborates with the Indonesian Psychological Association (HIMPSI). It was stated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding by the Vice-Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Sc., Apt with HIMPSI. The activity took place in the Academic Senate Room of the USU Academic Central Bureau Building on Monday, (04/07/2022).

Prof. Poppy said that in the future there will be many Tri Dharma activities that HIMPSI can do with the Faculty of Psychology. Mainly activities supported universities' Main Performance Indicators (KPI), such as inviting teaching practitioners on campus, holding webinars or seminars, and conducting joint research with HIMPSI.

“In the future, there will be many activities that can be done together. from the tri dharma activities including teaching, somehow inviting practitioners to teach on campus then they will join research with HIMPSI psychology and conduct joint webinars and seminars," said Prof. Poppy.

The Dean of the USU Faculty of Psychology, Zulkarnain, Ph.D., Psychology, said that the signing of the collaboration between the USU Faculty of Psychology and HIMPSI was a reaffirmation because the two parties had worked together a lot before.

“We are already running. Our activities with HIMPSI have probably been around for decades. It's just that there needs to be confirmed," he said.

This collaboration concentrates on the Professional Masters Study Program at the Faculty of Psychology because the learning and testing process involves professionals from HIMPSI as one the external examiners.

"So the goal is to ensure that the professional master's study program that we run is truly in line with HIMPSI's expectations," said the Dean of the Faculty of Psychology.

Prof. Dr. Seger Handoyo, Psychology added that HIMPSI cooperates with USU because USU is the only university outside Java with a professional psychology study program. In addition, the collaboration between USU and HIMPSI has lasted for decades, especially in professional education.

“So the first thing is because USU is one of the universities outside Java with a professional education. So out of 19, 18 are in Java, and only one is outside Java.As stated by the dean, professional education must be carried out in collaboration with professional organizations. It has been going on for decades," said Prof. Fresh.

Later, HIMPSI and the USU Faculty of Psychology will enhance cooperation after a follow-up with the leadership of the USU Faculty of Psychology.
