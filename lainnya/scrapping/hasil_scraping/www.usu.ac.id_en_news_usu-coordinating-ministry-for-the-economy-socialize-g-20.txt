The Intermediate Public Relations Bureau for the Communication, Information Services, and Conference Coordinating Minister for the Economic, Ferry Sovianto SE, MSi, said three main topics to be discussed at the G-20 forum.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia cooperated in the Socialization of the Implementation of the 2022 Indonesia G-20 Presidency. Held in the Senate Room of the Chancellor's Bureau on Saturday (28/05/2022), this activity discussed three main topics at the G-20 forum.

The Intermediate Public Relations Bureau for the Communication, Information Services, and Conference Coordinating Minister for the Economic, Ferry Sovianto SE, MSi, said three main topics to be discussed at the G-20 forum.

"First, Indonesia encourages the global health architecture, which is Indonesia's effort to get back up and improve governance and global health architecture after the pandemic," he said.

Second, Indonesia encourages digital-based transformation, especially Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) for digitization. It is because the digital market is up-and-coming for MSMEs.

"In addition, the development of digitalization commercial transactions in 2021 is increasing greatly. The government only subsidizes interest as much as 3% to make it easier for MSMEs to open businesses," he continued.

Third, Indonesia encourages the energy transition from fossil fuel energy to New Renewable Energy (EBT). The replacement of fossil fuels is expected to expand access to technology towards clean and affordable energy and ensure energy security and meet urgent needs.

"I hope that the lecturers and students will be able to bring their understanding of the G-20 closer," said Ferry.

On the same occasion, Secretary of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations of USU Rahma Yurliani S.Psi., M.Psi. said that the academic community was able to take a role in participating in the G-20 forum by contributing to express ideas.

"I hope that the lecturers present can pass on information about the G-20 to their respective faculties, especially fellow lecturers and students," he said.

For information, if anyone wants to be directly involved in the contribution of the G-20, they can visit the official G-20 website.
