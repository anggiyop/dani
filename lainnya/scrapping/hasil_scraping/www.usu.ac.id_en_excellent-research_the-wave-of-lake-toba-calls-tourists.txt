Tourism image certainly has a positive and significant impact on tourist satisfaction. However, experience value has a direct negative impact on tourist experience satisfaction. In contrast, the indirect relationship between tourism image and repeat visit intention through tourism experience satisfaction has a positive value.

Tourism is a major contributor to economic growth in many developing countries, including Indonesia. The Lake Toba tourist area in North Sumatra is known for its stunning natural beauty and unique cultural richness, which attract many local and foreign tourists. However, what makes tourists want to return to a destination?

Research conducted by Endang Sulistya Rini, Yeni Absah, Beby Karina Fawzeea Sembiring, and Muhammad Dharma Tuah Putra Nasution from the Universitas Sumatera Utara tries to answer this question by examining the influence of tourism image, experience value, and satisfaction on repeat visit intentions in the Lake Toba tourist area, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia.

On the one hand, tourism image certainly has a positive and significant impact on tourist satisfaction. However, experience value has a direct negative impact on tourist experience satisfaction. In contrast, the indirect relationship between tourism image and repeat visit intention through tourism experience satisfaction has a positive value.

Lake Toba has long been recognized as one of Indonesia’s main tourist destinations and has a very strong natural and cultural appeal. This area is known for its beautiful natural landscape, exotic Batak culture, and the fantastic history of lake formation. Endang Sulistya Rini et al. used the incidental sampling method with a sample of 324 tourists who had visited the Lake Toba tourist area. Data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics and Smart-PLS software.

In this digital era, information about tourist destinations is easily accessible to anyone, anytime. This image can be built through various means, such as social media, digital promotion, and cooperation with tourism influencers. “Therefore, a strong tourism image is needed to attract tourists’ attention. A positive tourism image can differentiate one destination from another, creating a unique attraction,” Endang explained.

However, having a good image is not enough. Travelers’ experience while in the destination determines whether or not they will return to the destination in the future. The tourist experience covers all aspects, including available facilities, interaction with local residents, and service quality. For example, infrastructure development such as good roads, easy transportation access, and comfortable accommodation facilities can increase the value of the tourist experience. “In addition, training local tourism actors to provide friendly and professional services is also important. Good and friendly service will leave a deep positive impression on tourists,” Endang added.

In addition, Endang explained that promotion is one of the most important factors. Effective promotion must convey the destination’s uniqueness and main attraction. Promotion through digital platforms, such as social media and websites, can reach a wider and more diverse audience. Promotional content must also be interesting and informative, displaying the advantages of destinations, such as natural beauty, culture, and activities that tourists can do.

The results showed that tourism image has a significant positive impact on tourists’ attractiveness. However, attraction value does not directly impact satisfaction. Experience value positively impacts repeat visit intentions through tourism experience satisfaction.

“These findings suggest that although experience value does not directly increase tourist satisfaction, improving tourism image can positively impact tourists’ intention to return,” explained Dr. Endang Sulistya Rini.

In the context of Lake Toba, for example, promotions can highlight its spectacular natural beauty, such as the view of the lake surrounded by mountains, and tourist activities, such as sailing on the lake, visiting the surrounding islands, and enjoying the rich Batak culture. “Introducing the local culture through festivals and cultural events can also attract tourists,” said Dr. Beby Karina Fawzeea Sembiring.

The implications of these findings are also very important for tourist destination managers. Focusing on improving tourism image and creating memorable experiences can be an effective strategy to increase repeat visits. This study contributes significantly to the tourism literature by emphasizing the importance of tourism image and tourist experience in determining repeat visit intentions. In line with these findings, destination marketing strategies should include improving destination image and enhancing the quality of tourist experiences. For example, the development of tourism infrastructure, improved service quality, and effective promotion can help reinforce a positive image of the destination. When satisfied with their experience, tourists are more likely to return and recommend the destination to others. Not only does it provide deep insights into tourist behavior, but it also offers practical guidance for stakeholders in the tourism sector. By applying these findings, it is hoped that tourist destinations in Indonesia, including Lake Toba, can continue to grow and provide an unforgettable experience for its visitors.

On the other hand, good tourism destination management also requires cooperation from various parties, including the government, business actors, and local communities. The government can play a role in providing adequate infrastructure and supporting regulations, while businesses can innovate in providing attractive tourist services and products. “Synergy between the government, private sector, and local communities is crucial to creating sustainable tourist destinations. Local communities must also be involved in tourism management so that they can directly benefit from this sector,” said Dr. Endang Sulistya Rini enthusiastically.

In addition, environmental sustainability should also be a significant concern in tourism development. The preservation of nature and local culture must be maintained so that tourism can continue to grow without damaging the ecosystem and local wisdom. Efforts such as good waste management, the use of renewable energy, and environmental education for tourists are essential to ensure that tourist destinations remain sustainable and attractive to visit in the long run.
