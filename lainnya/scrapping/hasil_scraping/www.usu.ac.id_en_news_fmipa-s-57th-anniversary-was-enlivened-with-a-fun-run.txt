"At the age of 57, it is not easy for deans, heads of study programs, and lecturers to change the way they teach and organize the outcomes of their work," the Rector stated.

USU Public Relations - Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) celebrated its 57th anniversary with the theme "Science and Entrepreneurship Collaboration in Realizing Campus Internationalization." Sunday (18/12/2022), FMIPA USU hosted a Fun Run in the USU area to enliven the celebration.

Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., Rector of USU, had the opportunity to attend and run with the FMIPA academic community.

In his remarks, the Rector of USU discussed the issues that FMIPA will face in the future. The Rector stated that FMIPA executives, lecturers, and students must be prepared to transform and innovate in the future.

The Transformation in concern refers to the classroom, particularly teaching strategies. According to the Rector, the classroom is no longer controlled by lecturers and students but rather by innovation that integrates education, research, and community service.

"At the age of 57, it is not easy for deans, heads of study programs, and lecturers to change the way they teach and organize the outcomes of their work," the Rector stated.

The Rector said that the Transformation depends on the input of lecturers and students, particularly research outcomes so that FMIPA USU's research products can eventually enter the research industry.

The Rector of USU added, "This now depends on the contribution of all of you, lecturers and students, to strengthen and accelerate the transformation we are undergoing."

In the meantime, it is known that FMIPA USU has contributed 130 Scopus-indexed papers. Through the topic of dies Natalis, it is hoped that all FMIPA USU academics would be able to work with researchers from other important universities. This was conveyed by Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, M.Sc., Dean of FMIPA at USU.

"On the occasion of our 57th anniversary, we chose this topic since, in terms of publications, we are among those who contribute the most, with 130 papers indexed by Scopus at the end of December," said the Dean of FMIPA USU. "However, we do not interact with eduka or other universities."

In addition, Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, M.Sc., stated that the FMIPA USU will continue to strengthen its education staff, teaching staff, and research-supporting infrastructure.

Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, M.Sc., stated, "Improvements in the field of human resources, especially competent education professionals, teaching staff are also competent, and especially in the field of research-supporting infrastructure require careful planning and specific strategies."

The Rector of USU, accompanied by FMIPA USU's leaders, also sang three songs at the Dies Natalis FMIPA USU event: Rumah Kita by God Bless, Go Home by Armada, and Terajana by Rhoma Irama. The Rector subsequently visited many bazaars set up at the event.

In addition to the Fun Run, Games, and Lucky Draw with a total value of 50 million Rupiah, the Anniversary of FMIPA USU will continue on December 19 with a Scientific Oration.
