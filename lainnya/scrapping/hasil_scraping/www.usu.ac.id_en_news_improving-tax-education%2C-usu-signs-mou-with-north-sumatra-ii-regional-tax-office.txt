USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: The signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Regional Office of the Directorate General of Taxes (DJP) of North Sumatra II is a bridge built to educate and increase understanding of taxes among USU students, lecturers, and education staff.

This was emphasized by USU Chancellor Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, in his remarks at the signing of the MoU between the two institutions held online on Thursday (15/7/2021). Virtually present on the occasion, Head of Regional Office of the North Sumatra II Directorate General of Taxes Anggrah Warsono, Vice Chancellor III of USU, Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si, Apt., Acting Head of P2 Public Relations Division of North Sumatra II Regional Tax Office Teguh Pribadi Prasetya, Section Head of Cooperation and Public Relations, Setya Purwanto, Section Head of Counseling and Guidance on Document Management, Krisman Hasintongan Purba, Section Head of Guidance and Consultation Services, Antoni Cahyo Wibowo.

"We from the Universitas Sumatera Utara express our gratitude and welcome the opportunity to cooperate with the Regional Office of the Directorate General of Taxes of North Sumatra II, which will later be discussed further whether the form of activity will be expanded in other possible fields where the collaboration is expected to be able to bring benefits for both parties involved especially in terms of institutional development and supporting other tri dharma activities," Dr. Mury said.

The Chancellor hoped dissemination could be done through seminars and coaching clinics for lecturers and all alums, considering that understanding of taxation is minimal. “So far, the collaboration between USU and DGT has been excellent. USU also already has a tax center, which is expected to expand its activities," he said.

This collaboration is also expected to open up opportunities for the implementation of the Independent Learning – Independent Campus program, which provides an excellent opportunity for the inclusion of elements of the industrial world and other parties in improving the quality of human resources pursued by universities as well as opening a more expansive space for the implementation of various activities that support the development of insight, knowledge, research, and innovation.

"We hope that with the signing of this memorandum of understanding for the next five years, the relationship between USU and the North Sumatra II Regional Tax Office will be closer and able to contribute to both institutions positively," the Chancellor said.

Meanwhile, the Head of the Regional Office of the North Sumatra II of the Directorate General of Taxes, Anggrah Warsono, explained that in the first semester of 2021, tax revenues in the ranks of the North Sumatra I and North Sumatra II DGT grew very positively where there was an increase in nominal value. To that end, the Regional Head of the Regional Office requested support from all parties, including USU.

“With the signing of this MoU, it is hoped that it will help with annual tax and tax returns. Currently, only 64 percent can be realized. We hope the USU Tax Center can help educate the public about taxation. In addition to tax education, this collaboration can also be explored in the field of research and study, which will be discussed further," the Head of Regional Office expected.

Also present were USU’s Vice Rector III’s Expert Staff Siti Salmiah, drg., Sp.KGA., the Dean of Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) USU, Drs. Hendra Harahap, M.Si., PhD., Deputy Deans of FISIP USU, Head of the D-III Tax Administration Study Program, Drs. Rasudyn Ginting, M.Si., Head of BP2KM Bureau and Collaboration of USU, Surya Darma, S.Sos., Secretary of the D-III Tax Administration Study Program, Drs. Kariono, M.Si., and other lecturers.
