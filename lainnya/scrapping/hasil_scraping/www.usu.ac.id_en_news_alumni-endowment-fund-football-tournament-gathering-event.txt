Of course, this match is not only about finding out who will be the champion, but more than that, it is about how we bring alumni to not forget Universitas Sumatera Utara," said Vice Rector I.

USU PR - The Directorate of Students and Alumni (Ditmawalumni) held the Final Match which also served as the Closing Ceremony for the Alumni Endowment Fund Football Tournament. This football tournament was held at the USU Mini Stadium, on Sunday (03/12/2023).

This football tournament is part of a series of events for USU's 71st Anniversary. Holding this competition also raises endowment funds from alumni. There are five Faculty Alumni Associations (IKA) involved in this competition, namely the Faculty of Dentistry (FKG), Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP), Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB), and Faculty of Law (FH). The champion of this football tournament, which was held for the first time, was won by IKA FISIP.

USU Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., expressed his gratitude to the alumni who participated in this activity. This competition is a return for alumni to their campus and also strengthens communication and collaboration between fellow alumni.

“You can see how friendly relations are expanding between fellow alumni. "Of course, this competition is not only about finding out who will be the champion, but more than that, it is about how we bring alumni to not forget Universitas Sumatera Utara," said Vice Rector I.

Vice Rector I said that sports competition activities like this must be carried out again every year. We hope that those who take part will not only come from the five faculties but all the faculties at USU.

"Because of that, we hope that next year, if this year there were five faculty alumni associations, next year there will be more than ten," he said.

Secretary of Ditwamawalumni, Rahmi Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi, said that holding this competition could broaden socialization by meeting alumni from various faculties.

“Just met his brothers and established a network, expanding the network too. "The alumni see that our alumni can also attract their companies," said Secretary Ditmawalumni.

Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si., as Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), welcomed the Alumni Endowment Football activities positively with the hope that next year they could add other sports.

"Various other sports activities, such as perhaps tennis," said Dr. Fadli.

First place in this tournament was won by the FISIP Alumni Association, while second place was won by the FEB Alumni Association, and third place was won by the FIB Alumni Association.
