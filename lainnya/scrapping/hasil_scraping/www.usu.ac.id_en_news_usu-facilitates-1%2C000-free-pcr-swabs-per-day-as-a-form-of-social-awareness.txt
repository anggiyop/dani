The implementing party prepares 500-1,000 PCR swab tests per day for the free PCR Swab service. "We hope that through this PCR SWAB test, we can reduce and prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in North Sumatra, especially in the university environment," Dr. Edy Ikhsan said.

USU PUBLIC RELATIONS – The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) facilitated free PCR swabs for students participating in the Covid-19 vaccination and the academic community at the Pancasila Building. The PCR swab was carried out by the Microbiology Laboratory of the USU Faculty of Medicine from September 29 to October 8, 2021.

Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A when reviewing the implementation of the free PCR swab said that this activity is a form of social services carried out by USU which is also part of the 69th Anniversary of USU and the Anniversary of the USU Faculty of Medicine.

"We hope that this is part of a social service that can help ease in the context of PCR. In the free PCR Swab service this time, the implementing party prepares 500-1,000 PCR swab tests per day. We hope that through this PCR SWAB test, it can reduce and prevent the transmission of Covid-19 in North Sumatra, especially in the university environment," Dr. Edy Ikhsan said.

The person in charge of the PCR Covid-19 Microbiology Laboratory of FKUSU dr. R. Lia Kusumawati Iswara, MBiomed, SpMK(K), PhD explained that the requirement to do this free PCR swab is to have an identity card, namely an ID card. NIK data from the KTP will be directly inputted into the AllRecord account which is directly connected to the Population and Civil Registration Service.

Lia Iswara explained that the results of the PCR swab will be out for 1x24 hours and can be viewed on the PeduliLingungi website.

"The results will come out 1x24 hours and the results of the swab are in accordance with national reporting standards, the public can see the results directly through the PeduliLindung website, the official website for screening," she explained.

The results of this PCR swab can later be used for screening various purposes, such as aviation.

"But of course flights have a time limit of 2x24 hours for the results of this PCR swab," Dr. Lia Iswara added.
