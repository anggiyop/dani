USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) symbolically released 14 students as well as welcoming students back to their homeland in the Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) Program in the IMT-GT Room, Monday, (24/07/2023).

Furthermore, the USU Rector mentioned that 2 obligations must be fulfilled by IISMA participants, namely, following the entire learning process at the destination campus and maintaining good relations with lecturers at the destination university to build a correspondence relationship.

"You also have an obligation to establish relationships with lecturers there or people who you think can follow up, correspond or we want to establish friendships with these campuses," said the USU Rector.

In line with that, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, said that students who take part in the IISMA program are campus ambassadors who will introduce USU in the international arena so that they can build networking for the development of campus internationalization.

"Outside, they are our ambassadors, our ambassadors who will also help in the internationalization aspect of the University of North Sumatra," said Dr. Edy.
