SMMPTN Barat is an independent selection pathway jointly conducted by public universities in Indonesia's western region, including Sumatra Island, the western region of Java Island, and Central Kalimantan Province.

USU PR—Registration for admission to public universities (PTN) through the Independent Selection for State Universities in the West Region (SMMPTN Barat) program for 2024 has been opened. A total quota of 16,564 has been allocated to 890 study programs (prodi) spread across 25 member universities.

SMMPTN Barat is an independent selection pathway jointly conducted by public universities in Indonesia's western region, including Sumatra Island, the western region of Java Island, and Central Kalimantan Province.

"The 25 member universities register more than 890 study programs for this Independent Selection with a total capacity of 16,564," said the Chairman of the West Region Public University Cooperation Board (BKS), Prof. Muryanto Amin, during the launch of SMMPTN Barat 2024 in Jakarta on Monday (May 6).

Prof. Muryanto Amin, who is also the Rector of USU, explained that registration has been open since May 4, 2024, at 15:00 WIB until June 20, 2024, at 16:00 WIB with a registration fee of Rp375,000 for all choices, both science and technology (saintek) or social-humanities.

Each prospective student will receive a payment ID after making the payment by June 20, 2024, at 16:00 WIB, with the deadline for printing the admission card on June 21, 2024, at 16:00 WIB.

In this year's independent selection, applicants can choose up to four study programs, both academic and vocational, to increase their chances of being accepted into a public university.

"The details of the offered study programs can be accessed on the website ssmmptnbarat.id, including information about the Institutional Development Fee (IPI) that must be fulfilled by prospective students at each university," said Supriyanto, secretary of the SMMPTN Barat 2024 Working Group.

The selection process for this pathway includes a Computer-Based Written Test (UTBK) or Computer Assisted Test (CAT), with additional assessment of portfolios, such as achievements and certificates, for applicants in arts and sports programs.

The test will be conducted from June 27 to July 5, 2024, and each participant will receive a schedule and choose a UTBK center during registration.

During registration, prospective students must choose one PTN program from a maximum of four choices as the location to take the UTBK.

Unlike the UTBK assessment, which follows the same parameters, the portfolio assessment is returned to universities with arts and humanities programs.

The 25 participating universities in this selection include Syiah Kuala University, Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University, Bengkulu University, Jambi University, Indonesian Institute of Arts Padangpanjang, Palangka Raya University, Malikussaleh University, and Raja Ali Haji Maritime University.

They also include Bangka Belitung University, Teuku Umar University, Sumatera Institute of Technology, Indonesian Institute of Arts Aceh, Samudra University, Riau University, Siliwangi University, Universitas Sumatera Utara, Andalas University, and Sultan Syarif Kasim Riau State Islamic University.

Mahmud Yunus Batusangkar State Islamic University, Syahada Padangsidempuan State Islamic University, Indonesian Institute of Arts Bandung, National Development University "Veteran" Jakarta, Singaperbangsa Karawang University, Imam Bonjol Padang State Islamic University, and Padang State University.

Deputy Chairman of SMMPTN Barat 2024, Ibrahim, stated that 9,000 prospective students have already registered to participate in the PTN admission selection through the SMMPTN Barat pathway, with a target of reaching 40,000 applicants.

"Our target is 40,000 applicants, and we are optimistic that it will be achieved because we already have 9,000 applicants since the opening," he said.
