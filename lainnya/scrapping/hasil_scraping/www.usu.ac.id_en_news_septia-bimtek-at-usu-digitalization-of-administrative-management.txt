“It is expected that later it will be able to carry out administrative activities more easily, quickly, transparently, orderly, integrated, productive, accurate, safe, and effective. This BIMTEK is also intended to deepen and improve the ability of human resources/operators to use the SEPTIA application in more detail", explained the Head of the USU TU Section

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) carried out Technical Guidance (BIMTEK) for the Integrated Office Electronic System (SEPTIA) to all work units. The activity took place at the USU Information System Center and online on Wednesday, (24/01/2023).

The SEPTIA application is one of the USU's continued innovations in transforming administrative management using the principles of efficiency and paperlessness. SEPTIA has been implemented at USU starting January 2024 as a response and adaptation in the digital era.

Head of USU Administration, Cut Hayatun Wardani S.Sos said that this BIMTEK aims to improve knowledge and skills to SEPTIA operators to support the realization of the Integrity Zone in the USU environment.

“It is hoped that later they will be able to carry out administrative activities more easily, quickly, transparently, orderly, integrated, productive, accurate, safe, and effective. This BIMTEK is also intended to deepen and improve the ability of HR/operators to use the SEPTIA application in more detail,” said Cut Hayatun Wardani S.Sos.

Nurrahmadayeni, S.Kom as the resource person said SEPTIA is an update of the previous system, namely e-office. SEPTIA has the main objective to achieve administrative management without the need to print letters (paperless).

“This system is a continuation of e-office, the goal is to be paperless. So previously, the e-office had to print the letter first and then initial it, in SEPTIA, it can be done digitally. So without having to print, it is determined who must verify, if it has been verified/checked, it continues to the TTE (Electronic Signature) stage, “said Nurrahmadayeni, S.Kom.

Furthermore, Nurrahmadayeni, S.Kom revealed that SEPTIA is an improvement system for the previous system. With the SEPTIA application, the administration process will be done more easily, quickly, and efficiently through digital.

“When TTE has been determined, the e-office must usually click the send button first and then add the recipient again. I can't add recipients, I forget, but now we have improved it. For the benefits, it is paperless, the process should be faster, wherever you are, even outside the city, can verify the letter and TTE wherever you are,” said Nurrahmadayeni, S.Kom.
