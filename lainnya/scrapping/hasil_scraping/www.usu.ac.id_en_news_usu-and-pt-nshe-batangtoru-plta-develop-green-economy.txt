Our organization, PT NSHE, continues to be guided by the Tri-dharma principles of education, research, and community service. Professor Muryanto Amin expressed his aspiration to not only provide assistance to NHSE and establish a partnership that would enable professors to engage in internships at the institution, thereby facilitating the exchange of technological knowledge.

USU PR - On Tuesday, July 25, 2023, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy (NSHE) Batangtoru Hydropower Plant in South Tapanuli signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The memorandum of agreement (MOU) was officially signed in the USU Rector's Audience Room, with the participation of Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si, the Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara, and Fauzi Leilan, the Director of PT. NSHE PLTA Batangtoru.

The expression of gratitude and welcome from the Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara towards the Regent of South Tapanuli and his staff, as well as the Directors of PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy (NSHE) Batangtoru Hydroelectric Power Plant (PLTA) and their staff, is rooted in the recognition that the forthcoming collaboration with this partner aligns closely with the Tri Dharma principles of education, research, and community service.

Our actions are driven by the Tri Dharma of Education, Research, and Community Service principles in collaboration with PT NSHE. Our intention is not alone to assist NHSE, but also to establish a collaborative partnership wherein academics can engage in internships at NHSE to enhance their technological skills further," he expressed.

In addition, Professor Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si expressed his intention to supervise and engage in deliberations regarding the tenets of a sustainable economy, as well as the potential repercussions that may arise from this investment endeavor, to mitigate any adverse effects on USU, local communities, and the natural environment. 

The investment proposal necessitates thorough examination, after which we will engage in a discourse regarding the potential ramifications that may arise. To mitigate the effects on USU, it is imperative to acquire knowledge of the technology employed at the hydropower plant, given its substantial scale. Understanding the principles underlying a green economy is of paramount importance in this context.

The importance of environmental health sustainability, among other factors, cannot be overstated. During the discussion, Fauzi Leilan, the Director of PT.NSHE PLTA Batangtoru, expressed the importance of ensuring that investments in the economy do not negatively impact local communities, particularly in terms of environmental preservation. He also expressed his willingness to collaborate in enhancing the expertise of lecturers and students, with a focus on their practical application in PT NSHE PLTA projects.

Fauzi Leilan indicated that the upcoming meeting would address cooperation agreements pertaining to specific programs, including social activities encompassing environmental and technological aspects. Additionally, the gathering will seek to devise an appropriate framework for partnership that ensures the attainment of optimal mutual advantages.

Additionally, it encompasses community service. Following the signing of this Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), subsequent meetings will be convened to deliberate on the intricacies of collaboration agreements pertaining to distinct program activities, encompassing social initiatives, environmental endeavors, and technological pursuits. The speaker expressed the need to establish a well-defined collaboration in order to achieve mutually advantageous outcomes.

H. Dolly Putra Parlindungan Pasaribu, S.Pt, MM, the Regent of South Tapanuli, expressed his appreciation for the interest shown by many stakeholders, including international entities, in investing in sustainable forest regions. The Regent of South Tapanuli has expressed confidence in the ongoing collaboration between the esteemed educational institution, University of Sumatera Utara (USU), and the environmentally conscious company, PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy (NSHE), specifically pertaining to the Batangtoru Hydroelectric Power Plant. This partnership aligns with South Tapanuli's vision of "Sustainable Utilisation of Natural Productivity," which aims to generate community benefits.

Indeed, it has been previously said that the Batang Toru environment is a forested region that continues to be preserved despite the influx of investments. The sustainability of this ecosystem has garnered interest from several international entities. In this particular scenario, our team expresses a strong inclination for engaging in collaborative efforts. The matter at hand pertains to the interaction between USU and NSHE. It is worth noting that USU is an esteemed educational establishment, while NSHE has consistently asserted the environmentally conscious nature of the aforementioned company. The aforementioned discovery is intended to serve as a point of reference for all stakeholders involved, especially the regional administration of South Sumatra, in their efforts to preserve this ecosystem in accordance with their vision of sustainable exploitation of natural resources.

He further emphasized that the preservation of these two interests is crucial due to the impact it has on the community and the long-term viability of this natural opening.
