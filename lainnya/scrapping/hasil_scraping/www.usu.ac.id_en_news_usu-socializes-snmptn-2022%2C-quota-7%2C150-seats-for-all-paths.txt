Held at the USU Auditorium on Wednesday (26/01/2022), this SNMPTN socialization aims to provide an understanding to SMA/SMK/MA Principals who will guide students in participating in the 2022 SNMPTN.

Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H, M.A, explained that the Higher Education Entrance Test Institute (LTMPT) had issued guidelines for implementing new student admissions for state universities in 2022.

"In these guidelines, LTMPT has established a test model and selection of prospective new students that refers to the principles of fairness, transparency, flexibility, efficiency, and accountability," said WR I.

According to him, the development of the selection process model is adjusted to the development of information technology, and the digitalization era through UTBK, as well as to improve the quality of the selection of new student admissions.

Therefore, Dr. Edy Ikhsan said that this socialization was important to avoid misinformation, delays in entering student data, and filling out the available selection registration format.

"So that participants who want to register through the SNMPTN route can avoid the risk of delays," he said.

In addition, school principals are also expected to be able to supervise important deadlines or dates that must be carried out, such as filling out the School and Student Database (PDSS), SNMPTN registration, and UTBK – SBMPTN registration.

"Socialization materials from the two resource persons will assist school principals in applying for the maximum number and help increase their students who register in the selection of USU's new SNMPTN admissions in 2022," he said.
