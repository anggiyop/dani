To encourage and support young people's talents and potential, Koball's FC USU, together with the Medan City Government, is holding a football match. The Medan City Government responded by helping to improve the Teladan Stadium, which will be carefully utilized in the future.

 

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the management of Koball's FC USU held an audience. This audience will later organize a U-11 Football Festival, which is a form of appreciation for supporting young talent. The audience was held at the FISIP USU Football Field on Friday (07/12/2024).

 

To encourage and support young people's talents and potential, Koball's FC USU, together with the Medan City Government, is holding a football match. The Medan City Government responded by helping to improve the Teladan Stadium, which will be carefully utilized in the future.

 

Prof. Dr. H. Abdi Yanto, S.E., M.Si., the General Chairman of Koball's USU FC, emphasized the importance of this activity for future athletes. This match is competing for the USU Rector's and Medan Mayor's cups, which were initially joined by 45 teams but were narrowed down to 32 teams through selection.

 

"Then this is competing for the Mayor's and USU Rector's cups. 45 teams joined it, but due to time constraints, we limited it to 32, so 13 teams were selected," he said.

 

Prof. Abdi hopes that if the participants have outstanding achievements, they will continue their studies at USU and activities in football competitions.

 

"We hope these young ones get to know USU, and if they excel, we hope they can study at USU campus," he expressed.

 

Furthermore, H. Dammikot Harahap, the Head of the Medan City Government's Youth and Sports Office, also expressed his appreciation for this activity and said he would continue to build adequate infrastructure for the athletes. He added that Medan will continue to look for new potential talents in football.

 

"The City Government greatly appreciates this activity because we will make Medan an active city. Among others, we will develop PSB (Football Association). We will look for new talents and continue to back this up and support it," he conveyed.
