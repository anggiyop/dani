he agricultural sector in Desa Suka holds promise, particularly with the byproducts of farming, such as straw. Unfortunately, this waste is rarely utilized optimally. In livestock farming, especially with goats, feed is often prepared without considering proper nutritional needs. As a result, the goats’ body weight is suboptimal, and they are more susceptible to disease. This not only economically disadvantages the farmers but also leads to unstable incomes.

MEDAN-HUMAS—The “Suka Maju” Livestock Group in Desa Suka, Tiga Panah Subdistrict, Karo Regency, has long been recognized for its potential in agriculture and livestock farming. Despite the growth in livestock farming, traditional management practices have limited the farmers’ ability to maximize profits.

 

The agricultural sector in Desa Suka holds promise, particularly with the byproducts of farming, such as straw. Unfortunately, this waste is rarely utilized optimally. In livestock farming, especially with goats, feed is often prepared without considering proper nutritional needs. As a result, the goats’ body weight is suboptimal, and they are more susceptible to disease. This not only economically disadvantages the farmers but also leads to unstable incomes.

 

A Community Service Team from the Faculty of Agriculture at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), led by Peni Patriani and supported by members Tati Vidiana Sari, Helova Leonard Panjaitan, and Uswatun Hasanah, conducted a series of educational and training sessions in Desa Suka. This Community Service Program focuses on enhancing farmers’ productivity and welfare through training and guidance based on the latest scientific knowledge and technology. The program also involved six students from the Faculty of Agriculture’s Animal Husbandry Program—Sondang Falentin br Hutajulu, Sofyan Yacob Sitepu, Lisma Hara Pulungan, Aji Darmawan, Fadinda Tri Regita, and Akmal Basir Daulay—providing them with valuable field experience.

 

The first step taken was a training session on livestock management using technology, specifically the use of a chopper machine. During this training, farmers, led by Sandro Ginting, were taught how to manage their livestock more effectively, particularly in creating a more structured feed that meets the nutritional needs of the animals. This training is expected to significantly increase goat productivity, leading to higher incomes for the farmers.

 

The Community Service Team also provided training on using natural additives, specifically Phytobiotic Green Additive, which serves as a preventive measure against diseases in goats without relying on synthetic antibiotics. By applying this additive, the health of the livestock is expected to improve, thereby minimizing the risk of economic losses due to disease.

 

In addition, to better utilize local resources, the farmers were trained to produce complete feed using agricultural waste such as straw. This feed not only helps increase the body weight of the livestock but also supports a more effective and economical goat fattening program.

 

The technical training for goat fattening was provided in detail to the farmers. With direct guidance from experts, the farmers now have a better understanding of how to optimize this program, allowing them to achieve greater profits. The implementation of more structured and modern management practices is expected to transform the traditionally managed livestock operations.

 

This program also plays a crucial role in achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including reducing poverty by increasing farmers’ economic income (SDG Goal 1) and creating healthier and more prosperous lives for farmers through improved livestock management (SDG Goal 3). The training also contributes to enhancing farmers’ skills and technological proficiency, aligning with the goals of sustainable economic development.

 

Moreover, this community service program offers valuable real-world experience to the students involved. They have the opportunity to learn directly from the field and engage in entrepreneurial activities in the livestock sector, supporting the achievement of university Key Performance Indicators (IKU). The program aligns with IKU 1 and 2, which aim to enhance students’ out-of-campus experiences, as well as IKU 5, which focuses on the application of research outcomes to the broader community.

 

With full support from the Community Service Team, the “Suka Maju” Livestock and Farming Group is now more optimistic about facing future challenges. The farmers believe that by adopting more advanced technology and knowledge, they can significantly improve livestock productivity and the welfare of their members. This program is expected to serve as a model for other farming and livestock groups in Karo Regency and surrounding areas, guiding them in transforming from traditional management practices to more modern and competitive operations.
