"We will involve USU lecturers who focus on that field to find out how to solve the land problem in North Sumatra, this research can also be continued with journal publications," said the Rector.

USU PR - The National Land Agency (BPN) cooperates with the Universitas Sumatera Utrara (USU) in solving land problems in North Sumatra. This was stated in the signing of the MoU by the Rector of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si, Dean of the USU Faculty of Law Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum and Director of Communal Land Management, Institutional Relations and PPAT, Dr. Musriyadi, SH, M.Kn, M.Hum at the USU Central Administration Bureau Building, Thursday (3/10/2022).

In his remarks, the Rector of USU said that USU is able to conduct research by involving lecturers who are experts in related fields, so that they can then provide recommendations, especially to provide legal certainty and improve people's welfare without reducing the investment aspect to drive the economy of the North Sumatra region.

"We will involve USU lecturers who focus on that field to find out how to solve the land problem in North Sumatra, this research can also be continued with journal publications," he said.

According to the Rector, there are many other forms of cooperation that can be carried out with BPN. He offered to allow human resources at BPN to carry out further master or doctoral studies at USU.

"We can make special classes for this, encourage human resources in regional offices or districts and cities to be maximized for the further learning process," he continued.

According to Dr. Muryanto, cooperation of Tri Darma in the fields of research, education and community service is very crucial. This is a form of the university's contribution to its environment.

“USU is able to provide solutions to problems or obstacles at BPN. For other programs, the basis is in the study program for signing cooperation on topics that are needed," said the Rector.

Director of Communal Land Management, Institutional Relations and PPAT, Dr. Musriyadi, SH, M.Kn, M.Hum said, ulayat land is a land entity that has not been fully exploited. This is an urgent problem for the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning of the National Land Agency.

"We have not been able to work on ulayat land, we need to do research on ulayat land, especially with the Faculty of Law," said Dr. Musriyadi.

For this reason, the ministry chose USU to find a solution because USU already has qualified human resources and infrastructure.

"Not only that, there are many scopes that can be done in cooperation, in education, training, also including infrastructure that can be used," he concluded. (©ULC)
