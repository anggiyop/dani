The USU Rector opened up opportunities for Scout activities to be counted in the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program with a weight of 20 credits. As is known, the MBKM program aims to provide cross-disciplinary learning experiences for students.

Medan - USU PR: The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. and the vice rectors were inaugurated as the Head of the Advisory Council of Medan Front Cluster 08-137 and 08-138 of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Base by the Chairman of the North Sumatra Regional Scout Council (Kwarda), H. Nurdin Lubis, S.H., M.M. The inauguration was held at Suhadji Hadibroto Hall, Faculty of Economics and Business, USU, on Monday afternoon (02/26/2024). In addition, Dr. Ar. Achmad Delianur, S.T., M.T., was inaugurated as the 08-137 Front Force Chairman, and Dr. Prawidya Hariani, RS. S.E., M.Si. as Chairman of the 08-138 Front Force.

In his speech, the USU Rector encouraged the socialization of the Scout Student Activity Unit (UKM) to the USU academic community. He says many students and lecturers still need to learn about the Scouts' existence at USU.

"I believe these activities could be integrated into the extracurricular offerings of each study program. We should innovate and create new options for extracurricular activities. I'm not sure if it's feasible, but perhaps MBKM activities involving Pramuka (Indonesian Scouts) could even be incorporated into the curriculum," he said.

The USU Rector opened up opportunities for Scout activities to be counted in the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program with a weight of 20 credits. As is known, the MBKM program aims to provide cross-disciplinary learning experiences for students.

“How to measure the success of learning outcomes related to scout activities with this 20 credit MBKM activity, in my opinion, is also quite interesting. Because the example also does not exist in Indonesia. So for lecturers, it is through the study program that they are involved in discussing the MBKM context at the Universitas Sumatera Utara, “said Muryanto Amin.

He added that this innovation can strengthen students' understanding of leadership values, love for the country, and development of unyielding character. Thus, students are equipped with theoretical knowledge and strengthened with other abilities that encourage self-capacity.

Muryanto Amin closed his speech by inviting North Sumatra Kwarda and Medan City Kwarcab to strengthen cooperation in practicing the Tri Darma of Higher Education. According to him, this value already exists in the Scout Movement, so collaboration is easy.

The event also saw the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Development of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education between the Universitas Sumatera Utara and Kwarda Sumatera Utara. This was followed by the signing a Cooperation Agreement (MoA) for the Development and Management of the North Sumatra Scout Traffic Park and Nature Studio, which is planned to be built at Campus II USU Kwala Bekala.
