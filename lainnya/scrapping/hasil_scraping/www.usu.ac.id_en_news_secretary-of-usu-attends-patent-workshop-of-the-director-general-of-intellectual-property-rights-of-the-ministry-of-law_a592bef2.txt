Secretary of USU Attends Patent Workshop of the Director General of Intellectual Property Rights of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights "God willing, in 2022 we will be able to enter the top 10 again. The more patents we submit for assessment, the more patents we issue, the more indexes there will be," said Prof. Fidel.

HUMAS USU - The Directorate General of Intellectual Property Rights, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia held a Workshop on Settlement of Patent Problems in the Regions with the theme "Post-Registration of Patents with Universities/Research and Development/Business Actors in the Regions". The activity which also invited the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) was held at the Grand Mercure Medan Angkasa on Wednesday (11/09/2022).

This activity aims to provide support and convenience to patent applicants or inventors at the Universitas Sumatera Utara to carry out consultations and guidance in order to accelerate the completion of patent applications.

Secretary of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Prof. Dr. dr. M. Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), SpOG(K) said that USU would be optimistic and try to get into the top 10 patent applications from universities in 2022 by looking in the mirror in 2020. If USU sends a lot of patents to be assessed and published, USU's performance index will be even better.

"God willing, in 2022 we will be able to enter the top 10 again. The more patents we submit for assessment, the more patents we issue, of course there will be more indexes," he said.

Director of Integrated Circuit Layout Design Patent and Trade Secret Drs. Yasmon, M.L.S really appreciates the Universitas Sumatera Utara which is so aggressively holding activities in terms of intellectual property. As of now, in 2022 the number of requests has increased.

Drs. Yasmon, M.L.S will also continue to support the various efforts made by USU to encourage researchers, inventors at USU and also universities in North Sumatra so as to increase the level of innovation in the country.

"We also see that the number of requests that have been submitted has increased. So, of course, this makes us happy that the number of domestic patent applications originating from public/private universities, Balitbang is also increasing. So, of course, this is an indicator of the increasing level of innovation in the country," he said. (©ULC)
