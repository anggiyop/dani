We hope that mobility exchange by our staff and students will be able to do this collaboration. Well, at least we hope that here we can also join research, can join the community association that we are currently doing. So we hope that there will be cooperation to provide input that will be carried out," said Prof. Isfenti

USU PR- The Faculty of Vocational Studies of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a "Guest Lecture and International Community Service" with Universiti Teknologi MARA (UITM) Malaysia. This activity took place in the Vocational Hall, on Thursday (09/09/2023).

Guest Lecture is bringing in a lecturer from abroad who studies a certain field to provide his knowledge about that field to the audience.

On this occasion, the Faculty of Vocational Studies invited 4 lecturers from UITM as speakers at the Guest Lecture, namely Prof. Dr. Azila Azmi, Dr. Suria Sulaiman, Ahmad Fauzan Badiuzaman, and Moh Syafiq Othman.

Prof. Dr. Isfenti Sadalia, SE.ME., as the Dean of the Faculty of Vocational Studies said that with this guest lecture, there will be an exchange of students, not only USU students who go to UITM but also vice versa.

"We hope that mobility exchange by our staff and students will be able to do this cooperation. Well, at least we hope that here later we can join research, can join the community association that we are currently doing. Now we hope there will be cooperation to provide input that will be done," said Prof. Isfenti.

The Dean of Vocational Studies added that Vocational Studies wants input and suggestions, as well as learning collaborations at UITM that can be used at Vocational Studies.

"We hope that at least there is collaborative teaching. Which subjects can be collaborated, then also before the beginning of collaborative teaching, of course, there is also a collaborative syllabus. Collaborative modules," he added.

UITM Senior Lecturer, Prof. Dr. Azila Azmi said that it is very common to collaborate with various faculties at USU, and one of them is the Faculty of Law.

"So, the latest UITM collaboration together with the Faculty of Law, namely the strategic education gran for development between Malaysia and Indonesia.

Furthermore, Ahmad Fauzan Badiuzaman, a lecturer from the Department of Culinary Art and Gastronomy UITM, said that food can be a product of innovation and economic value, and students must be able to manage this potential.

"Students need to understand what exactly they have a job to do. Their job is to increase understanding as well. We are the future leaders. And as future leaders there needs to be a mission or vision for the future. For example, from what I said earlier, how about the strategy of the food itself. We can be able to improve the economy of the local population or in the communities that are here, "explained Ahmad Fauzan.
