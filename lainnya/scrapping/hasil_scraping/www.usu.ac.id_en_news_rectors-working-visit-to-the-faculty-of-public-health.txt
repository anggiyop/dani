“To achieve our targets, we do not strengthen programs, but strategies in achieving performance indicators so that they become more effective,” said the Dean of FKM USU.

 

Public Relations USU - Returning to conduct work visits as a routine agenda at the beginning of the year, this time the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si., visited the Faculty of Public Health (FKM) on Friday, (17/01/2025) which took place at the FKM USU Auditorium.

In addition to aiming to strengthen the relationship between university leaders and various faculties at USU, the Rector said that this working visit was an activity that would monitor the performance of the faculty to determine USU's strategic plan in the future. With the government transition causing a new paradigm shift in higher education policy, the working visit also provides direction and strategic steps to all faculties.
