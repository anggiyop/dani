"We are targeting an increase in numbers this year. Therefore, we have organised a series of strategies and facilities. Today's socialisation is the beginning of these preparations. Later, participants will also be given assistance," said Muryanto Amin.

MEDAN - HUMAS USU: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has set a target to increase the number of participants who applies for the International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) in 2023. This was conveyed by USU Rector Dr Muryanto Amin, S Sos, M Si, when delivering directions and guidance at the USU IISMA Socialisation 2023, Monday (20/2/2023) through an online meeting.

Muryanto Amin said that USU had prepared a series of strategies and facilities to increase the participation of USU students as participants in IISMA 2023. According to him, preparations must be made carefully to achieve the expected results.

"We are targeting an increase in numbers this year. Therefore, we have organised a series of strategies and facilities. Today's socialisation is the beginning of these preparations. Later, participants will also be given assistance," said Muryanto Amin.

He mentioned that the IISMA Program is very important for USU. This programme supports USU's Strategic Plan so that it can have an impact on improving the university's ranking later on. He also added that the IISMA program opens a broader chance for collaboration with the international world.

"This program supports USU's strategic plan, especially the point about internationalisation. IISMA will increase USU's Academic Reputation with evidence of the expansion of USU's international network. Moreover, this also allows us to experience different academic environments. This gap should not be considered an obstacle but rather a strength to increase knowledge," he added.

The Head of the IISMA Program of the Ministry of Education and Culture, Dr. Rachmat A. Sriwijaya, MT, D.Eng, who was present as a guest speaker at the webinar, said that this programme covers at least three aspects as their main target. These targets are expected to improve education resources in Indonesia.

"Hopefully, IISMA will create human resources that are able to cope with industrial development. Automation has resulted in job losses, so IISMA is expected to improve students' skills. In addition, IISMA also provides an opportunity to learn about other countries' cultures. Furthermore, IISMA students are targeted to spread a positive virus to the development of education in Indonesia," he explained.

USU sent five people as IISMA awardees in 2021. This number then increased in 2022 to 10 people, so USU is targeting an increase again this year.
