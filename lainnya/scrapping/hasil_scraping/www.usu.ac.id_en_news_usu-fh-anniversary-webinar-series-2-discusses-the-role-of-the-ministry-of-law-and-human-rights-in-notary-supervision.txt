USU Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., MA said that concrete supervision from the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights, mandated in the Notary Law, was urgently needed to encourage notaries to carry out their duties in accordance with the code of ethics.

USU PR - Faculty of Law (FH) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Scientific Week Webinar Series 2 Legal Reflection entitled "The Role of the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights in the Framework of Guidance and Supervision of Notary Positions in line with the principle of Equality Before the Law ". The webinar, which is a series of the 68th anniversary of the USU Faculty of Law, was held through a Zoom Meeting, Tuesday (1/18/2022).

When opening the event, USU Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A. said that concrete supervision from the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights, mandated in the Notary Law, was urgently needed to encourage notaries to carry out their duties in accordance with the code of ethics.

"We know that not all notaries have the same capacity and ethics," said WR I.

WR I said, various studies concluded that the Ministry of Law and Human Rights needed to respond more firmly and dare to take a stand on the recommendations given by the assembly or supervisor.

"So the Notary Supervisory Board can stand up to notaries who violate ethics, and can give stricter sanctions," he said.

According to Dr. Edy Ikhsan, on the other hand there are also extraordinary demands for the government in encouraging notaries to be able to adjust their capacity to technological developments.

“The current acceleration of information technology has touched the notary profession, such as notary services that are already connected to information technology. Therefore, notaries are also required to be adaptive to technological advances," he continued.

On the same occasion, the Dean of the USU Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, S.H., M.Hum. said that this topic is very important because the notary position is one of the positions that are directly related to the public as service users.

"The position of a notary is also one of the positions regulated by law," he added.

Therefore, according to the Dean, there are several things that need to be discussed in this webinar, such as how to develop and supervise notaries so that notaries can be protected and the public is not harmed.

"Hopefully this webinar can also encourage all people who are notaries to have the awareness to obey the code of ethics," he said.(©ULC)
