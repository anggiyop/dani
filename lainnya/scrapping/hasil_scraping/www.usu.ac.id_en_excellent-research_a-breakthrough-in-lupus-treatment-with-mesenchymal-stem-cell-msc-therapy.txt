Discover the potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) as a promising alternative therapy for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), offering fewer side effects and improved immune regulation. Learn how MSCs could revolutionize autoimmune disease treatment through cutting-edge research by Dr. Dewi Masyithah Darlan and her team.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and damage to various organs in the body. This disease is caused by the production of autoantibodies that attack the body’s own tissues, marked by the presence of polyclonal autoreactive lymphocytes and mutated somatic autoantibodies. This leads to severe inflammation and dysfunction of multiple organs. SLE causes damage to the skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs.

Dr. Dewi Masyithah Darlan from the Department of Parasitology at Universitas Sumatera Utara stated, "Recent reports show that many people worldwide suffer from SLE, with an estimated 40 to 50 out of 100,000 people affected. The prevalence is two to three times higher in patients of Asian descent compared to those of European descent. This means that Asians like us are very susceptible to this disease," she emphasized.

To treat this disease, some people use conventional therapies involving immunosuppressive drugs and immunomodulatory agents. Although these can reduce inflammation, their effects are often temporary and require long-term use, which carries the risk of serious side effects such as infections and organ failure.

Therefore, Dr. Dewi Masyithah Darlan stated, "We urgently need another therapy that is more effective and safer for treating lupus because the side effects of conventional therapy drugs are very dangerous," she emphasized.

Furthermore, Dr. Dewi Masyithah Darlan said, "My research team, both from USU and outside USU, is currently conducting research on Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), as MSCs have great potential to treat lupus with fewer side effects," she explained.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have garnered attention due to their ability to regulate the immune system. MSCs are multipotent cells that can differentiate into various types of cells, such as bone, cartilage, fat, and nerve cells. Additionally, MSCs have immunomodulatory properties that can inhibit excessive immune cells.

The research has yielded positive results, showing that MSCs can help manage SLE by suppressing the activity of overactive immune cells. One important mechanism is through the formation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which function to maintain immune system balance. In SLE patients, the number of Tregs is often reduced, leading to imbalance and chronic inflammation.

Research conducted by Dr. Dewi Masyithah Darlan has shown that MSCs can increase the number of Tregs in SLE patients. In her study, MSCs were isolated from umbilical cords and cultured together with white blood cells from SLE patients for two to three weeks. These cells exhibited spindle-shaped characteristics similar to fibroblasts and were able to differentiate osteogenically, as evidenced by calcium deposits after 20 days of treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that MSCs from umbilical cords expressed specific markers CD90, CD105, and CD73 at high levels and lacked Lin expression. In co-culture with PBMCs from SLE patients, MSCs successfully increased the percentage of iTreg CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells, demonstrating MSCs' ability to induce naive T cells into functional iTregs.

The research also revealed that MSCs increased TGF-β1 levels in the supernatant of co-cultures with PBMCs from SLE patients, which plays a crucial role in Treg formation. A significant increase in TGF-β1 was found in the treatment group compared to the control, indicating the role of MSCs in promoting the regulation of functional Tregs through the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. These findings highlight the potential of MSCs as a therapeutic agent in controlling autoimmune diseases like SLE, with mechanisms involving the induction of Tregs through TGF-β1 release and the suppression of inflammatory immune responses.

Dr. Dewi Masyithah Darlan explained, "Alhamdulillah, from our research results, MSCs can become a promising alternative therapy for controlling SLE. This is because MSCs work by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines like Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). TGF-β1, in particular, plays a role in inducing Tregs and regulating the immune response. In this study, it was found that TGF-β1 levels significantly increased in MSC cultures with white blood cells from SLE patients, supporting Treg formation and helping to control inflammation," she explained.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer new hope in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). With their ability to regulate the immune system and promote Treg formation, MSCs can become an effective and safe alternative therapy.

However, Dr. Dewi Masyithah Darlan explained that this research is still in its early stages, but it shows promising potential for controlling excessive immune responses in SLE. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of MSCs and develop broader clinical applications to address autoimmune diseases like SLE.
