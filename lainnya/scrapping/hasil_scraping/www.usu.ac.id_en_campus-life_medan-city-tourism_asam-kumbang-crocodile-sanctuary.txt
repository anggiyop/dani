Asam Kumbang Crocodile Sanctuary

Asam Kumbang Crocodile Sanctuary is one of the legendary tourist destinations in Medan City, North Sumatra. Located on Jalan Bunga Raya II, Asam Kumbang Village, Medan Selayang District, this crocodile sanctuary has been established for 60 years since 1959. Built by a man named Lo Kie Yoe, also known as Lo Than Muk, this crocodile sanctuary covers an area of 2 hectares. Initially, his hobby of raising crocodiles started with 12 crocodiles obtained from rivers and swamps around Medan City. Than Muk, who in 1984 was recognized as North Sumatra's Best Environmental Pioneer, was renowned for his dedication. Even when the Columbus cruise ship tourist group landed at Belawan Harbor that same year, Than Muk warmly welcomed them. The Medan City Tourism Office saw the potential and asked Than Muk to open his crocodile farm as a tourist attraction. The entrance ticket to this crocodile sanctuary is affordable, costing only IDR10,000 per person. Visitors can enjoy the beauty of this park during operational hours, from 09:00 to 18:00.
