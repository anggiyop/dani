I, as the Director of Metrology, highly appreciate the leadership of Universitas Sumatera Utara. Hopefully, this collaboration can run successfully so that the graduates can work according to the needs," expressed Sri.

In his presentation on the importance of overcoming future challenges related to human resources, Dr. Rusmin Amin, S.Si., M.T., emphasized the steps in facing challenges to address human resource issues in trade with planned and strategic solutions. One of the steps that can be taken is to sharpen soft skills.

"Thus, colleagues in metrology and instrumentation at USU are here to fill the gap. And in my view, from a skills perspective, the vocation friends at USU can make use of it," explained Dr. Rusmin.

Vera Firmansyah, S.Si., M.Si., revealed plans to continue following the development of this collaboration, which began with curriculum alignment. Then, the focus will be on preparing prospective students who will undergo internships with certifications provided by the Metrology Training Center and Multi-Service Trade (BPMJP) online.

"From the presentation earlier, there are two additional topics that we can provide and certifications that we can offer. These steps demonstrate the seriousness of improving the quality of education and skills of students in the field of metrology and instrumentation," explained Vera.
