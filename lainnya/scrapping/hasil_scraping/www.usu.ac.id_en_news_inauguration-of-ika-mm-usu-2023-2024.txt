USU is currently working on internationalisation standards. One of the indicators that must be achieved is Employer Reputation. Regarding alumni in Master of Management (MM) about how useful they can be in the industrial world. Hence, we need alumni to help improve employer reputation. One of the benefits is to increase the number of industrial opportunities so that neighbouring countries can understand that USU is superior and cares about education," said the USU Rector

HUMAS USU - The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara, Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, attended the Inauguration of the Alumni Association of Master of Management of Universitas Sumatera Utara (IKA MM USU), which was held at the Royal Sumatra Club House, Saturday (18/02/2023).

Prior to the inauguration of the new board members, IKA MM USU held a forum which was led by Ir. Murlan Tamba, MM. This session was also held on the same day and the whole session was very well organised and conducive. Ultimately, Tarman Hartono was elected as Chairman of IKA MM USU for the 2023-2026 period to replace Gus Irawan Pasaribu, who served two terms in the previous period.

During the inauguration ceremony, not only was the USU Rector present, but also the Director of the USU Postgraduate School, Prof. Ir. T Sabrina, M.Agr.Sc Ph.D and the Head of the USU Postgraduate Master of Management Study Program, Dr. Meilita Trayana Sembiring S.T., M.T.

The existence of alumni is crucial in contributing to supporting USU's accreditation standards. This was conveyed by the USU Rector when giving a speech that the role of alumni is needed in improving internationalisation standards because there is one indicator that must be achieved and needs alumni involvement, which is Employer Reputation.

"USU is currently working on internationalisation standards. One of the indicators that must be achieved is Employer Reputation. Regarding alumni in Master of Management (MM) about how useful they can be in the industrial world. Hence, we need alumni to help improve employer reputation. One of the benefits is to increase the number of industrial opportunities so that neighbouring countries can understand that USU is superior and cares about education," said the USU Rector.

The elected chairman of IKA MM USU for the 2023-2026 period, Tarman Hartono, S.E., M.M., said that after the inauguration of this management, a consolidation between management master alumni will be carried out.

"The next step after this inauguration is to hold an alumni consolidation. Later on, there will be an alumni database to help improve the relationship between the master of management alumni and help achieve USU's internationalisation standards," said Tarman Hartono, S.E., M.M.

This alumni consolidation will not only connect alumni with each other and help improve USU's internationalisation accreditation. In addition, Tarman Hartono, S.E., M.M., hopes that the new chairmanship can help USU Master of Management Study Programme to become a leading study programme and will hold a seminar or public lecture for students in the near future.

"I hope this new chairmanship can make the USU Master of Management Study Programme more outstanding and we will involve the participation of alumni in various activities such as seminars and giving public lectures to students regularly to increase their insight or knowledge," he added.
