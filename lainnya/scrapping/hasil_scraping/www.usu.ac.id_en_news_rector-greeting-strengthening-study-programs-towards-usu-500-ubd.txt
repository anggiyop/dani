“Why is World Class University not just a document? (Because) we want to change the aura or thinking and then change our academic atmosphere for the better, in the midst of today's limitations, in us and in our institutions", said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si visited all faculties at USU to strengthen the Study Program (Prodi) towards USU 500 World Class University (UBD). This visit began on Wednesday (17/01/24) in the Suhadji Hadibroto Hall of FEB USU and was completed on Friday, (19/01/2024) in the 8th Floor Hall, DLCB USU.

The Rector greeted is an effort made by the USU Rector to invite lecturers and study program leaders to discuss the plans that USU wants to achieve in the next 2 years. Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si expressed his desire to put the institution into something important, because it can determine the success of the goals to be achieved.

“So if we know about the institution, we can definitely make (or) achieve what we want in the midst of limitations,” said the USU Rector.

World Class University (WCU) is a form of Strengthening Study Program towards USU 500 UBD. The Rector said that WCU is not just an official document but can change thinking and the academic atmosphere for the better.

“Why is World Class University not just a document? (Because) we want to change the aura or thinking and then change our academic atmosphere for the better, in the midst of today's limitations, in us and in our institutions,” said the USU Rector.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si shared 3 important points related to USU's future plans, namely education, research and publications, and community service.At the point of education, the USU Rector conveyed information related to the OBE Curriculum, which is a requirement for obtaining international accreditation. Until now, 66% of study programs do not have an OBE curriculum. Therefore, the Rector appealed to all study programs to change their curriculum to the OBE curriculum. The Rector also conveyed that he would accredit international study programs for all and revise the Higher Education SN according to the strength of the study program in the Rector's Regulation.

Furthermore, in the point of Research and Publication, the Rector conveyed the value of USU's international article publication, which is 0.8, meaning that it has not yet reached 1 lecturer 1 article. As many as 400 lecturers do not have SCOPUS-indexed articles. In response, the university facilitates article writing programs and rewards lecturers who have high writing productivity through the EQUITY program and programs at LIPIHKI. Therefore, the USU Rector hopes that within two years, one lecturer must have 1 journal.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos. M.Si also said that in terms of Community Service (PkM), the number of USU lecturers' research is still small in accordance with the National Research Priorities (PRN), and USU still has difficulty utilizing IPR into industrial products. Therefore, the USU Rector said that PkM must be directed to specific themes needed by the community based on business and industrial trends.

In addition to these 3 things, the Rector also conveyed other important issues in 2024, namely Key Performance Indicators, digitalization programs, priority infrastructure improvements, and Scientific Cluster Development and PUI.
