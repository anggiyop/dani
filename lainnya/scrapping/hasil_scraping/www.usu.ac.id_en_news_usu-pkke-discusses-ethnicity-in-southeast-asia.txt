"The Center for Cultural Studies is very important to oversee the activities of lecturers at USU in the study of culture and ethnicity," he said.

USU PR - Center for Cultural and Ethnic Studies (PKKE) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the 3rd discussion with the title "Ethnicity in Southeast Asia". The discussion was held through a zoom meeting, Monday (12/27/2021).

This discussion presented speakers from the Regional Research Center of the National Research and Innovation Agency, Prof. Dr. Yekti Maunati, M.A and respondents from Palangkaraya Christian University Dr. Marko Mahin, M.A.

In the opening, Vice Rector III Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Sc., Apt. appreciate the activities carried out by the Center for Cultural Studies.

"The Center for Cultural Studies is very important to oversee the activities of lecturers at USU in the study of culture and ethnicity," she said.

According to VR III, this activity is one of the supporters of the Main Performance Indicators (KPI). In IKU 5 there is an increase in lecturer activities, especially in terms of studies on ethnic culture and art.

"Hopefully in the future this study center can synergize and collaborate, and give encouragement to study programs in improving lecturer activities in this regard," said Prof. Poppy.

Head of the Center for Cultural and Ethnic Studies Prof. Dr. Budi Agustono said the issue of ethnicity has been going on for a long time.

"We are talking more broadly about ethnicity in Southeast Asia, in order to better understand that diversity is very important," he said.

According to Prof. Budi, this discussion is quite challenging to study, because it deals with related issues, such as ethnicity formation, ethnicity awareness, and ethnic solidarity.

"I think this is quite a challenging thing to discuss and study," he said.(©ULC)
