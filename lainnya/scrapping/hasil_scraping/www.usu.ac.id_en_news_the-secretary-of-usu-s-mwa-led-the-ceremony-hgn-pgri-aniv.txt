I am sure that the teachers as skippers do not want to reverse the direction of the Merdeka Belajar ship," said Nadiem, read by Prof. Guslihan

Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a ceremony to commemorate National Teacher's Day (HGN) and the Anniversary of the Indonesian Teachers Association (PGRI). The ceremony took place solemnly with the Secretary of the USU Board of Trustees (MWA), Prof. dr. Guslihan Dasatjipta Sp.A (K) acted as the ceremony supervisor in the USU Central Administration Bureau Building Court on Saturday (11/25/2023).

This year is the 78th anniversary of PGRI. At this celebration, the theme presented for PGRI's 2023 Anniversary is "Transformasi Guru Wujudkan Indonesia Maju" (Teacher Transformation to Realize Advanced Indonesia). On the other hand, the theme carried for the HGN celebration is "Bergerak Bersama Rayakan Merdeka Belajar" (Bergerak Bersama Rayakan Merdeka Belajar).

Prof. dr. Guslihan Dasatjipta Sp.A (K) read a mandate from the Minister of Education, Culture, Research and Technology (Mendikbudristek), Nadiem Makarim, who expressed confidence that educators throughout Indonesia will continue to strive to realize the concept of Merdeka Belajar. This belief is based on the success achieved over the past four years.

"I am sure that the teachers as skippers do not want to reverse the direction of the Merdeka Belajar ship," said Nadiem, read by Prof. Guslihan.

Through his written remarks, Minister Nadiem Makarim revealed that teachers highly anticipate the Merdeka Curriculum. This program is expected to ease the burden on students by reducing material, emphasizing in-depth understanding, and allowing teachers to develop creativity and innovate in fun learning according to student needs.

"If the National Assessment measures the goal of change, we are launching Merdeka Curriculum to provide a roadmap to achieve that goal," said Nadiem in his speech.

Finally, Minister Nadiem Makarim stated that a breakthrough was presented by launching driver-teacher education. This program differs from the existing teacher training because its goal is to encourage the birth of a generation of teachers, principals, and school supervisors who can lead real change.

"We are getting closer to achieving the target of one million ASN PPPK teachers to meet the needs of teachers and, of course, improve the welfare of educators," wrote Nadiem.

In line with that, Prof. dr. Guslihan Dasatjipta Sp.A (K) highlighted the importance of continuing the Merdeka Belajar and Kampus Merdeka programs, as stated by Minister Nadiem Makarim. He also underlined the urgency of improving teacher welfare, considering that many teachers still face welfare challenges at this time.

"Because we also know that currently there are many teachers whose welfare is still lacking, so it is hoped that the welfare of teachers can be better in the future," said Prof. Guslihan.
