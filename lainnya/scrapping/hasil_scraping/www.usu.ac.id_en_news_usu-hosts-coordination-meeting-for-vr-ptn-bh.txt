This Coordination Meeting aims to reformulate strategic policy programs in work in finance, personnel, planning and assets for the future. It was conveyed by the Rector of USU Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, MSi in his remarks.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted the Coordination Meeting with all Vice-Rector of State Universities Legal Entities (PTN-BH) for Finance, Personnel, Planning, and Assets. The meeting took place at the Adimulia Hotel Medan, on Friday (03/06/2020).

This Coordination Meeting aims to reformulate strategic policy programs in the areas of work in finance, personnel, planning and assets for the future. It was conveyed by the Rector of USU Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, MSi in his remarks.

"The main objective of holding this Coordination Meeting is to reformulate strategic policy programs in work in finance, personnel, planning and assets for the future," said Muryanto Amin.

Muryanto Amin added that there were several programs discussed in this coordination meeting, some of which were how to address the needs of employees in PTN-BH and how to increase profit income which was allowed by the government to be managed by PTN-BH.

The MBKM program that universities have adopted certainly requires new steps and breakthroughs in managing financial resources effectively and on target. Improving the quality of the personnel sector by targeting the realization of superior human resources for the sake of efficiency and bureaucratic reform and optimizing PTN-BH assets in supporting the implementation of the tri dharma mechanism.

"Strengthening PTN-BH can be productive and then overcome the problems experienced so far," he said.

In line with this, USU's Vice-Rector 5 for Asset and Business Management, Ir. Luhut Sihombing, MP also said that a lot of material was discussed in this coordination meeting. Some of which were about assets, human resources, endowment funds, and several other things that will develop later.
