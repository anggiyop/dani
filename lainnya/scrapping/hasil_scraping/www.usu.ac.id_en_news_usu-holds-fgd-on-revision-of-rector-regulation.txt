From Permendikbud Ristek 53 of 2023, it provides flexibility for universities to adapt and adjust the quality assurance system in universities according to the needs of universities, according to the excellence of universities," said the USU Rector

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) conducted a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) on the Revision of Academic Regulations of the Rector. This activity took place in the Suhadji Hadibroto Hall of FEB USU on (17/10/2023).

In his remarks through the Zoom meeting, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos.M.Si said that this FGD was based on the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology which has issued Permendikbud Ristek Number 53 of 2023 concerning Quality Assurance of Higher Education. He said the principle of this transformation is to place universities related to academic autonomy at Universitas Sumatera Utara.

"From Permendikbud Ristek 53 of 2023, it provides flexibility for universities to adapt and adjust the quality assurance system in universities according to the needs of universities, according to the excellence of universities," said USU Rector.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos.M.Si hopes that with the transformation of national standards and accreditation of higher education that is more liberating, it is hoped that universities will have more space to differentiate their missions and innovate; the administrative and financial burden on universities for accreditation is reduced; and universities can focus more on improving the quality of the Tridharma of Higher Education. He also explained that one form of simplification applied is the competency standards for graduates.

"One form of simplification that is applied is in the competency standards of graduates, namely: Previously, the formulation of attitudinal competencies, general knowledge, and general skills was described separately and in detail but afterward the competencies were no longer described in detail." added Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos.M.Si.

Dr. dr. Isti Ilmiati Fujiati, M.Sc.CM-FM., M.Pd.Ked., CIIQA as head of the USU Quality Assurance Agency explained that this FGD activity was carried out to obtain input from stakeholders which would later be divided into several stages, namely in the fields of education, research, and community service and for the Council of professors and directorates of institutions and agencies.

With the implementation of this FGD, it is hoped that it will facilitate and accelerate the Revision of Academic Regulations based on Permendikbudristek No. 53 of 2023.
