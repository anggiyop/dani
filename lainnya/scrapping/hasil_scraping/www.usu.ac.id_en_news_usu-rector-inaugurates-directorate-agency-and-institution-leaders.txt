Public Relations USU - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si inaugurated 19 officials to occupy positions as Heads of Directorates, Agencies, Institutions, and Work Units within USU. The event was held at the Student Center on Friday (13/05/2022).

The Chancellor conveyed several important messages to the inaugurated officials. First, to meet the demands and needs of duties and responsibilities, officials are expected to be able to provide good educational services.

“In addition, the officials must also be able to provide decisions and certainty for developments, changes and readiness from various kinds of problems that will come later,” he said.

Secondly, the rector advised that two things must be understood: ensuring that functions and tasks run according to what has been determined and coordinating, cooperating, and sharing among all USU staff.

“Officials are required to be able to adjust and work together to achieve certain goals and create a family environment among officials and staff,” he said.

The Rector added that the newly appointed officials have a specific work plan according to the times. The officials must be able to understand the current needs of the industry and improve their ranking in the accreditation and world-class university rankings.

Third, the rector reminded that the ongoing work program should be accelerated. A better work program must also be designed immediately.

“I hope that USU will become more efficient and its work targets will be achieved,” he said.
