A study by Universitas Sumatera Utara and Universitas Negeri Padang found that Roblox effectively enhances students' English literacy. The game integrates multimodal elements for an engaging and interactive learning experience.

In this fast-paced digital era, technology has permeated nearly every aspect of our lives, including education. Technology not only simplifies access to information but also creates new opportunities in learning methods. For the younger generation, especially students, technology has evolved into more than just an entertainment tool. It has now become an interactive and engaging learning medium, motivating them to explore knowledge with greater enthusiasm.

Various digital platforms, ranging from educational videos to interactive games, offer a more dynamic, relevant, and modern learning experience. In the context of language education, technology plays a crucial role in supporting the development of digital literacy, which is increasingly essential in the era of Industry 4.0.

One of the best examples of combining entertainment and learning is the gaming platform Roblox. Initially known as a popular game among children and teenagers, Roblox has now evolved into an effective tool for supporting teaching and learning processes, particularly in enhancing multimodal literacy. Through the use of Roblox, students are encouraged not only to read and write but also to think critically, communicate effectively, and develop essential digital skills for the future.

A collaborative study by Universitas Sumatera Utara and Universitas Negeri Padang, conducted by Prof. T. Silvana Sinar, Mohammad Andri Budiman, Rohani Ganie, and Rusdi Noor Rosa, found that Roblox can help middle school students strengthen their English literacy skills. In English learning, Roblox not only provides a fun gaming experience but also helps students understand the language through various modalities, such as text, images, sounds, and social interaction within the game.

“This is crucial to study, as in the era of Industry 4.0, digital literacy skills are becoming increasingly critical. Students need not only to be able to read and write but also to understand and produce texts in various formats, ranging from written text to visual and audio elements,” said Prof. T. Silvana.

The study was conducted on second-year middle school students in Medan, focusing on how digital games like Roblox can contribute to their multimodal literacy. In this research, the students were given two questionnaires: one to evaluate their needs for digital literacy and another to assess their perceptions of using Roblox in learning.

The research results revealed that nearly 93% of students were interested in learning through texts that combined verbal and visual elements. This indicates that the younger generation highly values learning materials presented in digital formats. Unfortunately, most students felt that teaching methods in schools had not yet maximized the use of multimedia to explain learning materials. In fact, 90% of students believed that using digital media would significantly help them in understanding English.

More than just a game, Roblox offers a fun learning experience for students. About 84% of students stated that they enjoyed learning through this medium, and 96.2% believed that Roblox helped improve their literacy skills. Its engaging design, easy accessibility, and multimodal elements such as text, images, and sounds made students more motivated to learn.

Roblox provides students with opportunities to engage with texts in various forms. They not only read and write but also listen to English and watch appealing visualizations. This active and interactive learning experience made students more enthusiastic about studying English.

“This study concludes that using games like Roblox has great potential for enhancing students’ multimodal literacy. In today’s digital world, teachers should consider using technology-based tools to meet students’ literacy needs. Games are no longer just for entertainment but can also serve as effective educational tools,” concluded Prof. T. Silvana.

Although the results of this study showed positive responses, the researchers recommended further studies to explore the actual effectiveness of using Roblox in improving students’ English literacy skills. This way, the future of enjoyable and beneficial learning will become even brighter.
