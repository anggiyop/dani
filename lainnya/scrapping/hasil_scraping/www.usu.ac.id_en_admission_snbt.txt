National Test-Based Selection (SNBT)

About SNBT

SNBT (National Selection Based on Test) is a national selection system for new student admissions to replace SBMPTN (Joint Selection for State Universities). In the SNBT pathway, state universities use a national written exam pattern. In the 2024/2025 Academic Year, students who obtain a high school / MA / SMK certificate are entitled to choose to continue their studies at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), both in undergraduate and diploma programs through UTBK (Computer-Based Written Test) selection. SNBT registration stages in 2025 are expected to be the same as in previous years, but the implementation of UTBK this year will be carried out in only one wave, although the details are still subject to change in accordance with the SNBT committee's policy.

Currently, the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) provides a minimum of 30% of the total capacity of undergraduate and diploma programs through the SNBT route.
