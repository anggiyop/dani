I sincerely believe that through the NRE Fest USU national seminar with the subject Youth Participation and Adaptation Towards Sustainable New & Renewable Energy, imaginative, responsive, and educative youngsters would be born in the development of renewable energy. "As a result, Indonesia's aspirations for resilient and clean energy security can be realized," stated the Deputy Governor.
