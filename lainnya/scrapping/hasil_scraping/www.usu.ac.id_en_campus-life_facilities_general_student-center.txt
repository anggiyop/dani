Student Center

The USU Student Center is a modern and multifunctional venue for non-academic activities. Equipped with a spacious meeting room that can accommodate up to 700 people, the building supports various social activities, seminars, olympiads, art performances, and meetings and has even been used as a venue for e-sport competitions. In addition, the Student Center courtyard is also often used to hold MSME bazaars, allowing local businesses to promote and sell their products to students and the general public. As a form of USU's commitment to providing a platform that supports student growth and development outside of the classroom, the Student Center creates an inspiring environment where students can interact, learn, collaborate, and support local businesses development.
