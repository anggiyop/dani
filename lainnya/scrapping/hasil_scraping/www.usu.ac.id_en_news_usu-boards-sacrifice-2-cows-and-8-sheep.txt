The Rector of USU said that the meaning of Eid al-Adha is to sacrifice to give the best wealth you have to share with the community. This sharing activity is a reminder to continue to pay attention to underprivileged community groups and this activity is carried out in various faculties at USU and will be carried out every year

PR USU - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., and his staff celebrated Eid al-Adha by performing qurban. The animals to be sacrificed are 2 oxen and 8 sheep. The activity took place in the parking lot of the USU Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP), on Monday (7/11/2022).

The Rector of USU said that the meaning of Eid al-Adha is to sacrifice to give the best wealth you have to share with the community. And this sharing activity is a reminder to continue to pay attention to underprivileged community groups and this activity is carried out in various faculties at USU and will be carried out every year.

"The meaning of Eid al-Adha is to sacrifice to give the best wealth you have to share with the community," he said.

The Rector of USU also hopes that as a Muslim, a Muslim must be able to forgive the sacrifice of his best wealth. So that it can be distributed to the underprivileged and this is in line with the services at USU because USU will sincerely provide the best service for students and the community.

"We can forgive the sacrifice of the best wealth and this is in line with the services at USU which will provide the best service sincerely," he said.

Acting Dean of USU FISIP, Dr. Hatta Ridho S.Sos., MSP said, the meaning of qurban this time was to imitate the attitude of Prophet Ibrahim who had the highest level of faith and sincerity in Allah so that with Allah's power he could replace Prophet Ibrahim's son with an animal as the sacrifice.

Acting Dean of USU FISIP also said that this year the qurban participants came from the USU Rector, Vice Rector I and Vice Rector II as well as several members of the USU Academic Senate. One-third of the results of the sacrificial animals will be processed into food and will be shared by the Rector and his staff and the rest will be distributed by the community through coupons that have been distributed previously.
