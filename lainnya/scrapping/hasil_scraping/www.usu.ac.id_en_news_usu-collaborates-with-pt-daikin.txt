USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said, the purpose of this collaboration was to optimize the principle of a mutually beneficial partnership as well as a form of implementation of the Merdeka Learning Program Merdeka Campus.

The Rector hopes that, with the signing of the memorandum of understanding, the relationship between the Universitas Sumatera Utara and PT. Daikin Applied Solutions Indonesia and PT. Asta Karya Indotama, can be closer and able to make a positive contribution to USU and the two industries.

President Director of PT. Daikin Applied Solutions Indonesia, Giam Tee Kiat, said that his party saw that many mock up/miniature chiller installations did not meet applicable standards. This collaboration is an opportunity to show students how to operate with the correct standard.

On the same occasion the Director of PT. Asta Karya Indotama Arief Rezana Dislan, SH, MH also said he would direct students how to properly install smart lamps. (©ULC)
