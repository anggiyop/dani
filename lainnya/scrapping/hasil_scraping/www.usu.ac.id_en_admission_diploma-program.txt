About Diploma Program

The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Diploma Program Student Admission Selection (SPMPD) is a selection of new diploma (D-3) level students held independently by USU through a computer-based written test (UTBK).

The SPMPD registration process is carried out online so that prospective students from various locations can access it openly without having to come directly to USU. Currently, USU has 14 study programs including diploma programs (D-3) which are in high demand.

Information about SPMPD related to registration procedures, registration requirements, exam types, exam venues, exam times, and tuition fees can be accessed through the SPMPD website.
