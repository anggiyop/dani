"I see that FCS has a great potential for how they can expand their expansion to teach Indonesian abroad," said Vice Rector I.

HUMAS - The Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the culmination of the 57th Dies Natalis celebration by holding a scientific oration that was packaged under the title "Opportunities and Challenges in Improving the Function of Indonesian to Become an International Language". Inviting the Head of the Center for Language Strengthening and Empowerment, Iwa Lukmana, MA, Ph.D. as the orator, the activity took place at the HT Amin Ridwan FIB USU Multipurpose Hall on Thursday (09/15/2022).

Based on the theme of the USU FIB 57th Anniversary Celebration “Opportunities and Challenges of Cultural Development in Strengthening Internationalization Programs”, USU Vice Rector I for Academic, Student and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH. The Supreme Court stated that FIB has considerable potential to expand its expansion to teach Indonesian abroad and will accept foreign students and lecturers whose learning process will begin by teaching BIPA (Indonesian for Foreign Speakers). So that it will support USU in the Internationalization program.

"I see that FCS has a great potential for how they can expand their expansion to teach Indonesian abroad," said Vice Rector I.

At the age of 57 years of FIB USU, Vice Rector I hopes that all components of the USU FIB academic community can work together to capitalize on the potential, processes, and networks of FCS to strengthen the targets that have been planned by FCS.

"We hope that all components of the academic community can work hand in hand with the leadership of the dean and all leaders here and how to capitalize on the potential, existing processes, existing networks to strengthen the targets that have been planned by FCS," he said.

USU's FIB Dean Dr. Dra. T. Thyrhaya Zein, MA said that FIB supports USU's strategic plan towards internationalization by launching the Indonesian language for foreign speakers, namely BIPA. According to the Dean of FIB, BIPA is one of the important things in the field of language that can promote internationalization.

"As Vice Rector 1 said earlier, we support USU's strategic plan towards internationalization and one of the things we think is important in the field of language in promoting internationalization is BIPA," explained the Dean of FIB. 

Dr. Dra. T. Thyrhaya Zein, MA said that FIB's human resources are very capable of supporting the internationalization program through BIPA.

In addition to the theme related to Indonesian and internationalization, FIB has a tagline that reads "Step for sure", based on the statement from the Dean of FIB USU on the tagline, all study programs at FIB USU in 2023 can achieve excellent accreditation, one of which is BIPA which will be implemented by HR at FIB. .

"In 2023, of course, the study programs at FIB can achieve superior accreditation and of course one of the points is that BIPA can be applied through HR at FIB," she added. (©ULC)
