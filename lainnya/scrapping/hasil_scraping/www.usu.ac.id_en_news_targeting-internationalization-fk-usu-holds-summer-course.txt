"We created this Summer Course program to support the internationalization of USU, namely student exchange activities, especially for inbound students who invite foreign students to come here," explained Prof. Poppy.

The Dean of the USU Faculty of Medicine, Prof. Dr. dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe Sp.S(K), explained that this activity is one of the efforts to follow the vision conveyed by the USU Rector to go International by holding a Summer Course involving speakers and participants from various countries this can also be recognized by the existence of FK USU in the international arena.

After that, Dr. Inke Nadia Diniyanti Lubis, M.Ked(Ped)., Sp.A, Ph.D said that this year the participation of the participants was much increased and came from various countries in Southeast Asia including Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, India and Bangladesh as well as various cities in Indonesia. He also mentioned that the theme was based on the importance of analysis at the genetic level.

"This theme was taken because, after the Covid pandemic, we realized that analysis at the genetic level is very important to better understand the differences - genetic differences in the characteristics of each disease so that we can have a better approach to treatment," he said.

Doctor Inke also hopes that in the future it can increase the network between participants and can propose even stronger cooperation.

For information, this year's International Summer Course has 20 programs and collaborates with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Besides USU, the 2023 International Summer Course is supported by 3 other universities, namely University Sains Malaysia, Prince of Songkla University in Thailand, and Reva University in India.
