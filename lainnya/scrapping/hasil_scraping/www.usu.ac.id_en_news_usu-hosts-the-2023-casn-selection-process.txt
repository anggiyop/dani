I am sure and believe that all participants have chosen the designated profession; there is already a commitment to it. And hopefully, this commitment and choice will be blessed by God for all of us," said the Rector of USU.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted the Basic Competency Selection for Civil Servant Candidates (CASN) 2023. The selection occurred at the Faculty of Medicine on Monday (11/13/2023).

After being the host two years ago, USU once again became the host for the venue of this event. Around 835 employees and educators from Universitas Sumatera Utara registered for CASN this year.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., the Rector of USU, in his welcome speech to all participants in CASN, urged them to strive and pray for divine approval throughout the test.

"I am sure and believe that all participants have chosen the designated profession; there is already a commitment to it. And hopefully, this commitment and choice will be blessed by God for all of us," said the Rector of USU.

The USU Rector gave a message to all CASN participants to always focus and be patient in answering the attached questions.

"Take your time answering the questions because the current assessment system is already digital; the results can be seen directly, and you cannot repeat the previous questions to answer. So this is important; concentration and patience are the main things," he emphasized.

Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP., serving as the Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance at USU, stated that participants in the selection must uphold honesty and compete fairly.

"A competition that produces the best civil servants, of course. And the hope is to compete healthily and capably," said Vice Rector II.

Dra. Syafnita Hanura Silalahi, M.SP., Head of the Human Resources Bureau at USU, expressed her hope that the selected participants would become teaching staff at Universitas Sumatera Utara.

"Alhamdulillah, this year there is a recruitment for USU with 165 positions for lecturers at Universitas Sumatera Utara," she said.

The Basic Competency Selection is carried out for a total of 5 days, from November 13-16, for the Civil Servant Candidate (CPNS) selection, while on November 17, there is a special selection for Government Employees with Employment Agreements (PPPK) who will be placed at RS USU and RSGM USU.
