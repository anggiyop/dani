"Looking back, the university is committed to supporting Team Horas and Team Asatama as delegates of Universitas Sumatera in various competitions. They participate because it is an achievement resulting from the students' hard work," explained Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a send-off ceremony for Team Horas and Team Asatama, the university's delegates in the Shell Eco-Marathon Asia-Pacific and the Middle East 2024 competition. The event occurred at the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB) USU on Thursday (Jun. 13, 2024)

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., Vice Rector I for Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, and Alumni of Universitas Sumatera Utara, highly appreciated Team Horas and Team Asatama. Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., stated that this is a significant achievement due to the hard work of students and lecturers who continuously improve the university's achievements.

"Looking back, the university is committed to supporting Team Horas and Team Asatama as delegates of Universitas Sumatera in various competitions. They participate because it is an achievement resulting from the students' hard work," explained Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

Rahma Yurliani S.Psi., M.Psi., Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations at Universitas Sumatera Utara, expressed full confidence in Team Horas and Team Asatama and hoped that both teams could perform their best and bring honor to the university on the international stage.

"We send off these two teams with hopes of winning in international competitions. They should stay focused on what they have worked on, and their achievements have yielded results, and they have also returned with empty hands," she emphasized.

Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, stated that this activity is recognized as a conversion in the program because it is part of practical work where Team Horas is a combination of programs in the Faculty of Engineering. Meanwhile, Team Asatama specifically consists of mechanical engineering students. Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi, S.T., M.Sc., IPM, hoped for future cross-program combinations that could form and enrich better team unity and also gave encouraging words to both teams, "sky is the limit," meaning to dare to face oneself first before looking at others.

Dr. Ir. M. Sabri MT. IPM. Asean Eng, the advisor and head of the Mechanical Engineering study program, along with Syafruddin Hasan as the advisor of Asatama, added that with this activity, it is hoped that students can continue to create because this is an ongoing activity. In the future, it is expected that there will be an improvement in fostering unity, intelligence, and excellence with the team.
