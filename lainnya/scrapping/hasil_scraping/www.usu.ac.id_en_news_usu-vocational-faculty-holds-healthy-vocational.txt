"Hopefully, this will build an emotional bond between professors and students, along with partners who will support the learning process at Vocational School later on. We anticipate that this Vocational School will become a hub for student skill development in the coming years, "said the Rector of USU.

USU Public Relations - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Faculty of Vocational Studies held USU Healthy Vocation. On Saturday (17/12/2022), the USU Faculty of Vocational Studies had fun walks, free medical check-ups, jujitsu attractions, MJC training, traditional dance performances, and live music.

Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara, highlighted in his remarks that establishing a vocation that will become a hub for improving student talents requires strong support from USU and the entire academic community.
