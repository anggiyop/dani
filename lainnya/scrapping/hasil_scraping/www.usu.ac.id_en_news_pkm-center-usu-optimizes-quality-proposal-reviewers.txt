“This is a good opportunity for us to prepare better and organize PKM activities to achieve better results at PIMNAS 37 at Universitas Airlangga,” said Dr. Edy.

USU PR - The PKM Center of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) maximizes the preparation of PKM Year 2024 by carrying out the USU Student Creativity Program (PKM) Internal Reviewer Perception Equalization activity. The activity was held online through a zoom meeting, on Friday (02/01/2024).

USU Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA. highlighted the potential of the USU PKM Center in running and changing governance to build a USU PKM development scheme. Given that previously there was no clear structure, in the context of USU's involvement in prestigious student competitions by Belmawa.

“This is a good opportunity for us to prepare better and organize PKM activities to achieve better results at PIMNAS 37 at Universitas Airlangga,” said Dr. Edy.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, also emphasized that the stakeholders involved understand the provisions in the PKM 2024 Guidelines. Thus, these guidelines can be implemented while assisting students, starting from the beginning until later at the proposal funding stage. Therefore, the role of reviewers is needed to ensure that the students' proposals are in accordance with these guidelines.

“We need input from reviewers and fellow reviewers to build on each other so that in the end, from that commitment, we can add to our national jury later,” explained Dr. Edy.

Ir. Erni Misran ST, MT, PhD, acting as Head of the USU PKM Center Task Force as well as being a speaker at the event, stated that from the initial stage, it must be ensured that the proposal is in accordance with the field of focus of the students. Thus, in the review process later, the feasibility of the proposal can be assessed substantively in accordance with the predetermined assessment criteria.

“During the assessment, of course, we also need criticism and suggestions from the reviewers regarding the students' proposals. So we are optimistic that the quota will be met with quality proposals,” said Ir. Erni.

On the same occasion, Suri Mutia Siregar, S.Psi., M.Psi. as Secretary of PKM Center USU, delivered a report on the preparation of PKM USU in 2024. The USU PKM Center team is committed to improving USU's achievements from 2022-2023, which managed to become the best university in cluster II, and in 2023, USU managed to be ranked in the top 15 universities qualifying for PIMNAS 36.

“This achievement is certainly something we should be grateful for, and hopefully, in 2024, we will also achieve the same achievement and even better,” said Suri.

Suri Mutia Siregar, S.Psi., M.Psi. also explained the preparation strategy for PKM USU in 2024 from the USU PKM Center team, namely conducting socialization to lecturers and students, holding roadshows in each faculty, and turning off that PKM Corner in each faculty conducts coaching by inviting ex-PIMNAS students.

“We have actually started this strategy from January until the time to submit the proposal, so we ask for input from you,” said Suri.
