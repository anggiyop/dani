"We have many things to complete this year to support the important 2024 target related to the achievement of USU's international ranking", said Vice Rector I USU.

USU PR - Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, led the morning assembly in the courtyard of the USU Central Administration Bureau Building, on Monday (22/01/2024).

In his speech, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, said that USU experienced many improvements in various fields under the responsibility of Vice Rector I in 2023. Some of these improvements are the 100% achievement in PDDIKTI, the implementation of digital diplomas, the implementation of dozens of doctoral promotions and inauguration of professors, and having 70 superior accredited study programs and 5 internationally accredited study programs.

“USU has made a lot of progress in various aspects that are our responsibility,” he said.

Vice Rector I mentioned several important things that become commitments and challenges in 2024 in pursuing a world ranking of 500. Therefore, the completion of information systems such as the OBE curriculum will be carried out, seeking international accreditation for 16 study programs, developing admission pathways, and supporting the rector's priority programs related to pursuing international rankings.

“There are many things that we must complete this year to support the important 2024 target related to achieving USU's international ranking,” he said.

Not only focusing on internationalization, Vice Rector I said USU will also improve the achievement of KPI and emphasize increasing student achievement in various national competitions. In addition, he hopes that this year he can again channel scholarship support and develop scholarships for incoming international students.

“In particular, I emphasize getting gold medals in various national levels. One of them is our dream, PIMNAS 2024,” he said.

Vice Rector I advised to complete all policies at the university level, increase cohesiveness with each other, carry out tasks seriously, and re-cultivate routine meetings and evaluations.

“Our cohesiveness in working and the principle of helping each other must be made a habit or work culture,” he hoped.

Dr. dr. Isti Ilmiati Fujiati, M.Sc., CMFM, M.Pd.Ked., Sp.KKLP., as Head of the USU Quality Assurance Agency (BPM) who also attended this activity expressed full support for all programs related to internationalization. He added that the USU quality culture will be held every week.

“The USU quality assurance agency fully supports the programs of the vice rector 1 and the rector related to internationalization,” he said.
