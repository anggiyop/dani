Do not trust anyone who claims to be able to help pass UTBK participants to become USU students. There are no brokers for new student admissions at USU. If anyone believes in brokers, it means they don't believe in themselves, said the rector.

USU PR - The 2023 National Selection Test-Based Computer-Based Written Test (UTBK-SNBT) organized by the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia through the National Selection Team for New Student Admission (SNPMB) PTN 2023 at the University of North Sumatra (USU), officially began Monday (8/5/2023) morning, at 06.45 WIB.

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, the vice-rectors, and the UTBK committee visited several exam rooms at the USU Faculty of Medicine and SMAN I Medan as UTBK USU partners to see firsthand the implementation. On occasion, the USU Rector said that the implementation of UTBK-SNBT 2023 at USU was attended by 38,260 participants, including one participant with a blind disability, who will take the exam in session five next Wednesday (10/5/2023).

"For UTBK-SNBT 2023, the Universitas Sumatera Utara provides 2,902 seats for prospective new undergraduate students offered through 49 study programs and 1,020 seats for D3 through 14 study programs. So this year, we accept around 3,922 students for S1 and D3. The number of UTBK-SNBT registrants this year is around 38 thousand," said the rector.

The Rector also emphasized that there are no brokers in the new student admission system at USU, as rumored ahead of UTBK.

"Do not trust anyone who claims to be able to help pass UTBK participants to become USU students. There are no brokers for new student admissions at USU. If anyone believes in brokers, it means they don't believe in themselves," he said.

UTBK at USU is divided into two waves: wave I, which runs from May 8 to 13, 2023, and wave II from May 22 to 28, 2023. UTBK is held in Session I from 06.45 to 10.30 WIB and Session II from 13.00 to 16.45 WIB. The schedule is exempted for UTBK session II which takes place on Friday and adjusts to the Friday prayer schedule, so it lasts from 13.45 to 17.30 WIB.

The exam locations are in the USU area and UTBK USU partners, with a total computer capacity provided for participants totaling 1,610 computers, consisting of 1,185 computers in locations within the University of North Sumatra, 140 computers at Telkom Shandy Putra Private Vocational School, 145 computers at Sari Mutiara University and 140 computers at SMAN 1 Medan.

"The UTBK material given this year differs greatly from the previous year. This year there are no memorization questions. All rely more on literacy or storytelling skills, both in Indonesian and English. The literacy skills of participants in this UTBK are very important to understand and answer the questions given," said the rector.

Answering journalists' questions regarding the admission quota at USU, the rector explained that USU, which holds the status of PTNBH, is given a provision to accept independent students by a maximum of 50 percent for those who are SNBP or invitation paths of at least 20 percent and those through SNBT of at least 30 percent. He dismissed the notion that there was a reduced quota this year.

UTBK-SNBT 2023 can be followed by students who graduated in 2021, 2022, and 2023 from secondary education (SMA/MA/SMK and equivalent), as well as graduates of Package C in 2021, 2022, and 2023, with a maximum age of 25 years as of July 1, 2023. SNBT 2023 graduation results are scheduled to be announced on June 20, 2023.

Visitation conducted by the USU Rector on the first day of UTBK did not find significant obstacles, both in terms of technical and other matters. "Alhamdulillah, UTBK today went well and smoothly. We hope that this condition can be maintained until the end of UTBK later," added Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin. (Renny Julia Harahap)
