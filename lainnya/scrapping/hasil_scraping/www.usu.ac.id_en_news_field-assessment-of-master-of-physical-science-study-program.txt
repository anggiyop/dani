Surely the development of physics in high schools in North Sumatra has a lot to do with what you lecturers have done throughout the age (of the Physical Science study program) of 20 years," said Dr. Edy

USU PR - The Natural Sciences and Formal Sciences Self-Accreditation Agency (LAMSAMA) conducted a Field Assessment for the Physics Doctoral Program of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). The opening of the Field Assessment took place in the Multipurpose Room 1st Floor Unit 8 FMIPA USU, Thursday (16/11/2023).

The Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., who was represented by the Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs of USU, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, welcomed the arrival of two assessor teams at the Field Assessment this time, including Prof. Dr. Techn. Marzuki, MSc. Eng. from Andalas University and Prof. Dr. Heri Sutanto, S.Si., M.Si. from Diponegoro University.

Dr. Edy said the assessor team placed the study program internationalization scheme as one of the factors in the development of the study program. In total 168 study programs at USU, approximately 70% of study programs have achieved superior accreditation. However, some developments must be addressed. Especially with the issuance of the Ministry of Research and Technology 53 which will touch on various accreditation governance in the future, both at BAN-PT and at independent accreditation institutions.

Dr. Edy also said that many of the Master of Physical Science students are high school teachers. Therefore, the development of physics in high schools in North Sumatra is much related to what has been done by lecturers throughout this study program.

"Of course, the development of physics in high schools in North Sumatra has a lot to do with what you lecturers have done throughout the age of (the Physics Science study program) 20 years," said Dr. Edy.

The Dean of FMIPA USU, Prof. Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu M.Sc., hopes that the Accreditation Field Assessment will make the Physics Science Doctoral Study Program an excellent accreditation.

"But we will return everything to the field assessment carried out today," said Prof. Nursahara.

In his interview opportunity, Prof. Dr. Techn. Marzuki, MSc. Eng. shared the stages in the Field Assessment process starting with discussions with the Head of the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), followed by discussions with lecturers, and discussions with other stakeholders including users, alumni and students.

"The stages have also been set by LAMSAMA but we adjust them too," said Prof. Marzuki.

For your information, the Accreditation Field Assessment of the Physics Science Doctoral Study Program lasted for two days.
