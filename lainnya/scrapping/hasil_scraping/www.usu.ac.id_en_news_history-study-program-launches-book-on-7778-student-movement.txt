“The emergence of critical awareness from students to maintain justice and democracy can apply,” Prof. Edy hoped.

 

Public Relations USU - The History Study Program of the Faculty of Cultural Sciences, Universitas Sumatera Utara (FIB USU), together with the Rizal Ramli Initiative Foundation, launched a book entitled 'Reformasi Kepagian Student Movement 77/78 Medan, North Sumatra' at the FIB USU Multipurpose Building, on Wednesday (19/02/2025).

 

Vice Rector I of USU, Prof. Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., representing the Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos. M.Si., in his speech, expressed his gratitude and happiness, especially to the authors, for the launch of the book 'Reformasi Kepagian Student Movement 77/78 Medan, North Sumatra'. He said the 77/78 Student Movement events were one of the important historical journeys in which many USU students at that time were involved. So with the presence of this book, many people can learn about the 77/78 Student Movement in Medan, North Sumatra. 

“We are very happy that you wrote it as a historical record that we can read together,” he said.

 

The authors of the book 'Reformasi Kepagian Student Movement 77/78 Medan, North Sumatra' are Dr. Khaerulsyah Nasution, Sp. PD, Drs. M. Chatib Usman, Dr. Azwan Hakim Lubis, Sp.A. M. Kes.

 

The Student Movement is a natural thing to control power that is not right. USU Vice Rector I, Prof. Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., emphasized that as long as the student movement aims to maintain democratic principles, uphold the law, and ensure justice without discrimination, the movement is a success of the education system. Therefore, USU also always accepts student criticism, for example, through democratic action.   

“As long as the student movement brings an atmosphere of how the principles of democracy are carried out, I think it is a good result of education,” he said.

 

VR I once again appreciated the launch of the book that raised the heroism of activists in 77/78. Through the book, it is hoped that valuable lessons can be learned from the 77/78 Student Movement. He hopes that students will develop critical awareness to maintain justice and democracy. 

“The emergence of critical awareness from students to uphold justice and sustain democracy,” he hoped.

 

In his speech, Dr. KH, Romo R. Muhammad Syafi'I, S.H., M.Hum., Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, also expressed his appreciation for the book launch, which was considered an important contribution to remembering the struggle of students in every era. He emphasized that this book can achieve socio-cultural information and can be a source of change.

“This book is socio-cultural, providing information to us actually in each era, we must continue to make changes,” he said.

 

Dr. KH, Romo R. Muhammad Syafi'I, S.H., M.Hum., said that the essence of a movement lies in its ultimate goal. Whether it is a pure initiative or the result of external encouragement, the most important thing is that the movement aims to create change for the better. 

“What we hope for is, of course, change for good. The important thing is that the movement and its goals are really for the good of the future,” he explained.
