"The challenge we clearly face is, first: human resources must be improved in both quality and quantity because it cannot be denied that one person is not stronger than several people, as multiple individuals are needed for faculty PR," said Prof. Fidel.

HUMAS USU – Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a public relations strengthening workshop titled "Strengthening Public Relations Management Through Competence & Competition." This activity aims to enhance public relations management's quality and competence within USU and prepare for the Anugerah Humas Diktiristek (AHD) 2024 competition.

 

The workshop, held at the Video Conference Room, 4th Floor, USU Rectorate Bureau, featured two expert speakers in public relations: Yayat Hendayana, S.S., M.Si., Coordinator of General Substance, Public Relations, and Cooperation, and Doddy Zulkifli Indra Atmaja, S.I.Kom., M.Si., Sub-Coordinator of Public Relations at the Directorate General of Higher Education, Research, and Technology. The event took place on Monday (29/07/24).

 

In his opening remarks, Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp. O.G, Subsp. F.E.R., Secretary of Universitas Sumatera Utara, expressed his appreciation for the presence of both speakers and hoped that this workshop would benefit all public relations work units (sicker humans) within USU. He also emphasized improving public relations's human resources (HR) quality to tackle increasingly complex challenges.

 

Prof. Fidel acknowledged that one of the main challenges university public relations faces is limited human resources. Therefore, through this workshop, all public relations units are expected to enhance their competence and work quality, allowing USU to compete with other universities in the AHD competition.

 

"The challenge we face is. First, human resources must be improved in quality and quantity because it cannot be denied that one person is not stronger than several people, as multiple individuals are needed for faculty PR," said Prof. Fidel.

 

This workshop aims to improve understanding of effective and efficient public relations management, enhance the competence and skills of public relations personnel, prepare USU for the AHD 2024 competition, and establish a networking system among public relations managers within USU.

 

With the implementation of this workshop, public relations managers at USU are expected to be able to carry out their duties more professionally, thus making a significant contribution to the university's progress.
