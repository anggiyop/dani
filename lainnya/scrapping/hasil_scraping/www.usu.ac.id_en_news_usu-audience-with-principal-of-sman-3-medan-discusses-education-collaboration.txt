“With good facilities and programs, students are expected to compete more strongly at the national level,” said Prof. Muryanto.

USU PR - Principal of SMA Negeri 3 Medan, Susianto S.Pd., M.Si., together with a number of alumni, held an audience with the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos. M.Si., who is also one of the school's 1992 alumni. The meeting took place in the USU Rector's Audience Room, on Monday (28/08/2024).

The main purpose of this audience was to build collaboration between SMA Negeri 3 Medan and USU to increase student motivation and competence, especially for grade 12 students who will continue their education to college through a seminar.

In addition to motivation, the audience also discussed measures to improve student competitiveness. The USU Rector gave suggestions for SMA Negeri 3 Medan to prepare students to be more competitive in facing the National Selection Based on Achievement (SNBP) and improve school support facilities.

“With good facilities and programs, students are expected to compete more strongly at the national level,” said Prof. Muryanto.

The Principal of SMA Negeri 3 Medan said that one of the reasons for holding this audience was to invite the USU Rector as a speaker at the alumni gathering and to motivate the 12th grade students. This audience not only highlighted the need for student motivation, but also further plans in the form of a seminar by the USU Rector for SMA Negeri 3 Medan students.

“As the current USU Rector is an alumnus of SMA Negeri 3 Medan, we see him as an example of a successful alumni with excellent performance, who can provide inspiration to our students,” Susianto said.

This cooperation plan will be followed up with a seminar by the USU Rector in November. SMAN 3 Medan is arranging a schedule for this seminar to take place, with the aim of broadening the students' horizons regarding higher education. The head of SMA Negeri 3 Medan hopes to continue to establish good relations with USU, encourage students to achieve, and improve the quality of education in the school environment.

“We will invite the Rector back to give a public lecture in November,” said Susianto.
