MEDAN - PR: The Covid-19 Mitigation Innovation Team of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has succeeded in producing a hand sanitizer that is believed to be more stable and effective in providing protection from germs. Currently, the handsanitizer product is still used on the internal campus.

Head of the Covid-19 Mitigation Innovation Team at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Apt. Imam Bagus Sumantri, S.Farm., M.Si. said the idea of producing a hand sanitizer originated from their desire to produce a hand sanitizer that is more stable and effective in providing protection.

“So our product can provide 99 percent protection against germs, especially on the hands because the hands are organs that always come into contact with anything,” said Imam Bagus Sumantri, accompanied by Apt. Henny Sri Wahyuni, S.Farm, M.Si, Apt. Lia Laila, S.Farm., M.Si, Apt. Sri Yuliasmi, S.Farm., M.Si and drg. Rika Mayasari Alamsyah, M.Kes, Thursday (27/5).

Imam Bagus Sumantri explained that the hand sanitizer product they produced had gone through several tests. As a result, the handsanitizer they produce is more stable than other handsanitizers.

“The stability will continue to be maintained even though the conditions are in extreme heat or it can be said that the conditions are not in accordance with storage, but we still try to keep the alcohol content as high as 70 percent,” he explained.

“So we tested the alcohol level several times, and it remained stable at 70 percent,” added Imam Bagus.

In the future, Imam continued, this hand sanitizer is ready to be mass produced and can be used by the public at an affordable price.

“Currently, we are still using it internally, but we have traded it to the Ministry of Law and Human Rights and we have already obtained a distribution permit from the Ministry of Health. Previously, we collaborated in industrial-scale mass production in collaboration with one of the industries owned by alumni so that we could produce 1000 liters or the equivalent of 10 thousand bottles. However, it is still used internally (within USU),” concluded Imam.
