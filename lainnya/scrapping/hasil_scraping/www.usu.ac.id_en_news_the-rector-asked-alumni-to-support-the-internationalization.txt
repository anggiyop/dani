The Rector of USU explained that his official visit to the United States, along with the delegation, is aimed at building international networks, particularly in America. "The event held this morning (seminar) is a strategy employed by USU to establish trust in USU's commitment to internationalization. We are here to introduce USU and invite diaspora and USU alumni in the United States to collaborate, synergize for the development of USU in realizing university internationalization," said Professor Mury in his opening remarks.

USU Public Relations - Professor Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., the Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), has called upon the diaspora and USU alumni currently studying or pursuing careers in the United States to lend their support to the university's ongoing internationalization efforts. The Rector expressed this during the Seminar on Indonesian Education Towards Internationalization, which took place at the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia (KBRI) in Washington DC on Saturday, June 3, 2023.

During his visit to the United States, accompanied by a delegation, the Rector explained that the primary purpose was to establish international networks, particularly in America. "The seminar held this morning serves as a strategic initiative by USU to foster trust in our commitment to internationalization. We are here to introduce USU and encourage collaboration and synergy among the diaspora and USU alumni in the United States, with the aim of advancing USU's internationalization goals," stated Professor Muryanto during his opening speech.

Rosan Perkasa Roeslani, MBA, MA, the Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to the United States, who hosted the event, emphasized the full support of the Embassy towards collaborative endeavors and synergies between Indonesian state universities and their counterparts in the United States.

"We highly appreciate the efforts undertaken by USU today, as it signifies a step towards building networks with universities and the diaspora community in America. The Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia reiterates its full support for the continued progress of USU's internationalization initiative," affirmed Rosan.

The Seminar on Indonesian Education Towards Internationalization, initiated by USU in the United States, featured distinguished speakers such as Professor Etin Anwar, PhD, from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York, who specializes in Religious Studies. Additionally, Professor Taifo Mahmud, a USU alumnus and faculty member at Oregon State University, along with Armaya Doremi, a USU alumnus who completed his master's degree at Northeastern University Boston, were also present.

In her presentation, Professor Etin Anwar discussed the importance of focusing on USU's prominent study programs based on the Scimago Rank. "USU should prioritize its strengths in four key disciplines to drive its internationalization efforts: economics and business, accounting, dentistry, and agriculture," she highlighted.

Furthermore, Professor Etin emphasized the need to establish international classes for these four programs, utilizing English as the primary medium of instruction, to serve as exemplars within USU.

Professor Taifo Mahmud praised USU's strides under the leadership of Rector Professor Muryanto Amin, recognizing the university's endeavors to foster collaborations with various global institutions. According to him, such collaborations serve as the foundation for successful internationalization.

"The most crucial collaboration that USU must pursue involves joint research, double degree programs, and a focus on research excellence. USU can refer to international ranking standards to shape and develop state-of-the-art facilities that enhance students' academic abilities. Additionally, USU must prioritize student-centric approaches in educational development," he emphasized.

Echoing the sentiments of the previous speakers, Armaya Doremi expressed his admiration for USU's significant achievements in recent years. He credited his time at USU for equipping him with the necessary skills to face global challenges, exemplified by his completion of a master's degree at Northeastern University.

Armaya urged USU graduates to continually enhance their knowledge, particularly in terms of soft skills, to thrive in the global arena. "Language proficiency, particularly in foreign languages, should be initiated during the undergraduate years. Moreover, effective communication, adaptability to change, and leveraging technology are crucial aspects to master,".

After the event, Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin expressed his gratitude to the Indonesian Ambassador to the United States and the staff of the Indonesian Embassy in Washington DC for their successful coordination of various USU initiatives in the United States. The Rector extended his hope for continued full support from USU alumni and the diaspora community in America, particularly in the university's internationalization program and the establishment of partnerships with American universities.

During his visit to the United States, the USU Rector successfully forged collaborations with renowned institutions, such as Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and Babson College. At the 75th NAFSA Annual Conference & Expo, USU entered into cooperation agreements with California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSBs), University of California, Irvine (UCI), IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca in Italy, and Ludwigshafen University of Business and Society (LUBS) in Germany.

Simultaneously, Vice Chancellor I Dr. Edy Ikhsan and Vice Chancellor III Prof. Poppy Anjelisa Hasibuan visited Pakistan and explored cooperative opportunities with several universities in the Middle East, including Iqra University, Indus University, and NED University of Engineering and Technology.

The internationalization programs implemented under the leadership of Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin have yielded positive results in USU's international rankings. In the latest release of THE Impact Rankings 2023, USU significantly improved its position, moving from the 1001+ range to 801 out of 1,591 top-ranked campuses worldwide. This accomplishment places USU as the 16th best university in Indonesia.
