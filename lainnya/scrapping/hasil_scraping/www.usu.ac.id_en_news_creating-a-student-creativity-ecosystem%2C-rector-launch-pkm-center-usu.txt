Muryanto Amin said the PKM Center USU was momentum to create the right ecosystem to increase student creativity.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatra Utara (USU) Dr Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., officially launched the USU PKM Center. The launch was carried out on Wednesday (2/2/2022) in the lobby of the USU Central Administrative Bureau. Also present were the USU Vice-Rector, University Secretary, and the Dean and Deputy Dean I at USU. Muryanto Amin explained that the USU PKM Center is an effort to increase student creativity and innovation.

USU PKM Center is a momentum to create the right ecosystem for increasing student creativity. “Our way to increase student creativity must be TSM, structured, systematic, and massive. We have to create that ecosystem as soon as possible. We can no longer run in the normal way, we have to accelerate up to two times to get maximum results in the next one or two years, "said the USU Rector.

The ecosystem he meant was to make PKM (Student Creativity Program) as an event to express student creativity. This understanding of PKM must be well socialized. In addition, the campus environment also supports a conducive academic atmosphere that can increase student creativity.

“This PKM must be taught in the classroom. The university-level PKM Center is just the mastermind. This program must be rolled out to faculties, study programs, lecturers, to students. All these stages must understand and understand how a PKM proposal is good so that it can qualify for creativity competitions, such as PIMNAS, "he said.

As is known, USU will host the 34th National Scientific Week (PIMNAS) in 2021. USU has won several medals but can't do further. UGM came out as the overall champion in the event.

“I insist on fighting for us to be the host of PIMNAS last year. The goal is to open our eyes and our way of thinking if there are still many things that we have to fix. Because sometimes, when I say it, it can't be caught and understood. With PIMNAS, I want to convey this is our current situation," he said.

The Rector of USU emphasized that he should carry out an accelerated program to increase PKM within USU. Collaboration between students and lecturers is the key in this regard.

He encourages study programs not to be rigid to foster student creativity. “I hope that my study program will be able to encourage student creativity. Collaboration between students and lecturers is the key. To increase experience and understanding, invite practitioners to become lecturers if necessary. It will provide a real-case learning experience so that students' abilities will be honed," he explained.

The same thing was conveyed by USU's Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., who emphasized that PKM Center USU is a form of USU's seriousness in improving the student's quality.

“This increase in creativity will be in line with the increase in achievement. The idea of ​​having a USU PKM Center is a point where we can maximize all of our potential and capabilities," said Edy.

Symbolically, the USU Rector played the gong to launch the USU PKM Center. Ir Erni Misran, S.T., M.T., Ph.D. was asked to chair the USU PKM Center Task Force. In addition, the USU Rector also presented a scarf to the USU PKM Ambassador, Sindy Elisa Tanjung.
