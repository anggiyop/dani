USU PR—The 34th National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) was filled with poster exhibitions and talk shows on Thursday (10/28/2021). The poster exhibition featured 735 posters on scientific products consisting of 8 PKM fields and was open to the public, especially middle and high school students.

These PKMs include PKMs in exact research, humanities research, entrepreneurship, community service, science and technology implementation, creative initiative, constructive futuristic ideas, and written ideas.

While reviewing the exhibition, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin said that the participants' posters contained very innovative scientific products. “All of the products are good. Hopefully, this can be followed up with follow-up activities. The products in the displayed posters can be downstream and commercialized," said the Rector.

The jury will judge posters for about 90 minutes starting at 1.00 PM. The jury will observe the posters offline. After the judging process, at 04.00 PM, there will be a talk show with the USU Rector, the Chairperson of the Puspresnas Jury, and the EO on the theme 'Tips for Making Good Posters to Pass PKM'.

"The talk show will also stimulate what will be done after the PKM," said Muryanto. USU 34th PIMNAS Poster Coordinator Ir. Diana Chalil, M.Sc., PhD, also explained that the purpose of the Talk Show is so that visitors will not only enjoy themselves but also get some tips on how to participate in a series of PIMNAS events one day.

Diana's team has thoroughly prepared everything from printing and installation to display arrangement.

"There are so many posters that must be displayed in such a way as to provide a good presentation for the jury and exhibition visitors," she said.

This PIMNAS poster exhibition also invited students from the city of Medan, including high school and vocational students. Hopefully, they will enjoy themselves and gain new knowledge.

An USU student, Ivan Bakara, said he was enthusiastic about visiting the poster exhibition. According to him, with this poster exhibition, many people see ideas and solutions to current problems. “From this PIMNAS poster exhibition, I got a lot of information. The poster display is also certainly very creative,” he said. (©ULC)
