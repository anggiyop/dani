"The summer course, sabbatical leave, student mobility programs are designed to provide transfer experiences for campuses around the world. USU's current students not only come from locally and nationally, but also come from various countries of the world. Tri Darma services must be internationally standardized to bring together academics, practitioners, students and other groups in an inclusive manner," the Rector of USU said, in his presentation.

"The summer course, sabbatical leave, student mobility programs are designed to provide transfer experiences for campuses around the world. USU's current students not only come from locally and nationally, but also come from various countries of the world. Tri Darma services must be internationally standardized to bring together academics, practitioners, students and other groups in an inclusive manner," the Rector of USU said, in his presentation.

Muryanto's presentation at the QS forum was also meant to socialize USU's transformation to participants who were present from various countries in the world. This activity is also expected to further enhance and expand inter-institutional partnerships.
