Futsal Court

Futsal courts at the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) are available in several faculties, including the Faculty of Medicine at the USU Student Hall, the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, and the Faculty of Engineering at USU Civil Engineering. The futsal field at the USU Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology has quite complete facilities. It is a relatively recently built, standard-sized court with court guidelines and lights around the field that are adequate for matches at night. In addition, a futsal court is also available at the Faculty of Medicine located at the Student Hall area. This field is most often used for international or inter-campus competitions. The last field is located at USU Civil Engineering with similar facilities. For students and the general public who want to exercise futsal in a comfortable and conducive atmosphere, this court can be rented at an affordable price.
