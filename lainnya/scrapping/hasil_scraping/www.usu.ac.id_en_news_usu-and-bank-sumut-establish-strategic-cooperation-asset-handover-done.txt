“We see asset management as a source of additional income for the university. In the future, USU will form a new business management agency that specifically handles asset and business management,” said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., together with the President Director of PT Bank Sumatera Utara (SUMUT), Babay Parid Wazdi, on Tuesday (24/09/2024) inaugurated the handover of the USU sub-branch office (KCP) building. This event also marked the return of USU's leasehold land that had been used by Bank Sumut for 20 years.

 

In his remarks, the USU Rector expressed his appreciation for the good cooperation between the two institutions. He explained that USU is currently focusing on asset structuring and more effective asset management. The plan to form a new business management agency will also be carried out to optimize the potential of USU's assets.

 

“We see asset management as a source of additional income for the university. In the future, USU will form a new business management agency that specifically handles asset and business management,” said the USU Rector.

 

In line with the USU Rector, the President Director of PT Bank Sumut also underlined the importance of the cooperation that has been established so far. Babay Parid Wazdi revealed that Bank Sumut does not only pursue profits, but is also committed to contributing to the development of North Sumatra. This is evidenced by various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs that have been carried out, such as providing dividends to local governments and supporting the holding of the National Sports Week (PON) in 2024.

 

On this occasion, Babay Parid Wazdi also expressed his hope that USU could become a quality human resource (HR) for Bank Sumut. He invited USU graduates to join and have a career at Bank Sumut.

 

“We hope this cooperation can continue to be improved. USU is a very potential human resource for Bank Sumut. We are open to receiving the best USU graduates to join us,” Babaya said.
