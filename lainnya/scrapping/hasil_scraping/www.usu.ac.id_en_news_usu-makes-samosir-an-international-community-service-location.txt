This year, we will organize an international community service (Kuliah Kerja Nyata - KKN) in Samosir. Since USU is hosting, there's an agreement among State Universities in the Western Region, from Aceh to Kalimantan, along with several campuses from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. The location for the international KKN will be in Samosir, this year," explained the Rector of USU

USU PR – The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), together with the Regent of Samosir Regency, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enhance ongoing cooperation in various fields. This meeting took place in the FEB’s Transit Room on Wednesday (Jan. 17, 2024).

The collaboration between USU and the Samosir Regency Government is a continuation of previous collaborations. In this regard, the cooperation will cover various areas, including education and training, health, agriculture and animal husbandry, tourism, industry, trade, research and development, as well as regional infrastructure.

The Rector of USU, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., mentioned that Samosir will be the location for the implementation of the International Community Service (KKN) involving several countries, including campuses from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. This international KKN is planned for July and August.
