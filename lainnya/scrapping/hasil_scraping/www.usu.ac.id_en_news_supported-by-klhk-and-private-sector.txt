Vice Dean of the Faculty of Forestry in charge of Cooperation, Prof. Dr. Agus Purwoko, S.Hut. M.Si explained that the parties who have committed to support the development of this Taman Kehati include the Forestry and Environment Office of North Sumatra Province, PT Toba Pulp Lestari Tbk (TPL), PT Agincourt Resources, PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy (NSHE) and the North Sumatra Natural Resources Conservation Center

MEDAN-PR: The commitment of Universitas Sumatera Utara in supporting efforts to improve the quality of the environment and biodiversity, one of which is through the development of the Biodiversity Park (Taman Kehati). The development of Taman Kehati USU is supported by various USU partners, especially the Ministry of Environment and Forestry.

The soft launching of the development of Taman Kehati was carried out with the signing of an inscription by the Secretary General of the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry and Environment Dr. Ir Bambang Hendroyono, MM, witnessed by Acting Director General of Forestry Planning and Environmental Management Dr. Ir Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, M.Sc and Dean of the USU Faculty of Forestry Dr. Rudi Hartono, S.Hut. M.Si, some time ago.

Taman Kehati is a reserve area for local biological natural resources outside the forest area which has in-situ and ex-situ conservation functions. Especially for plants whose pollination and seed dispersal must be assisted by animals, with a structure and composition of vegetation that can support the preservation of pollinating and seed-dispersing animals. The development of the USU Kehati Park was pioneered by the academic community of the Forestry Faculty. The location of Kehati Park development is in the USU Kwala Bekala Campus 2 area, precisely in the arboretum area and its surroundings.

Support for the development of the USU Kehati Park flows from various parties who have been USU partners. Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Forestry in charge of Cooperation, Prof. Dr. Agus Purwoko, S.Hut. M.Si explained that the parties who have committed to support the development of the Taman Kehati include the Forestry and Environment Service of North Sumatra Province, PT Toba Pulp Lestari Tbk (TPL), PT Agincourt Resources, PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy (NSHE) and the North Sumatra Natural Resources Conservation Center.

One of the activists in the development of Taman Kehati USU, Dr Oding Affandi, said that this program was echoed by the Ministry of Environment, which was held to save various native/local plant species that have a very high level of threat to their sustainability or threats that result in their extinction. This follows the function and purpose of the USU Arboretum, which has been enriched with dozens of tree species from various regions, especially North Sumatra.

Until now, in cooperation and voluntarily, lecturers and students of the USU Faculty of Forestry continue to plant and add to the existing tree collection. Currently, the USU Faculty of Forestry is preparing a Master Plan for the development of Taman Kehati, together with other USU faculties and partners. It is hoped that Taman Kehati will become one of USU's contributions that will support the achievement of Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030. ((RJ/Agus)
