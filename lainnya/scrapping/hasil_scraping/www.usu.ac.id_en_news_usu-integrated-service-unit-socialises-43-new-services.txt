In this socialisation, it was revealed that the Integrated Service Unit (ULT) services which were initially only 25 increased in number to 68 services. According to the University Secretary, this socialisation is essential because ULT plays a role as a front line barometer of stakeholders' satisfaction level.

HUMAS USU - The Integrated Service Unit (ULT) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) introduced a number of new services on Friday (17/03/2023). The activity was started by the Secretary of the University, Prof. Dr. dr. Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked (OG), Sp. OG (K) in the Senate Meeting Room, USU Bureau of Central Administration Building.

The head of ULT, Drg. Siti Salmiah, Sp. KGA was the speaker at the event, which was attended by all deans and first vice deans (of each faculty), directors of directorates, heads of bureaus, heads of units, heads of divisions, leaders of subdivisions, and ASA staff, as well as contact persons within USU.

In this socialisation, it was revealed that the Integrated Service Unit (ULT) services which were initially only 25 increased in number to 68 services. According to the University Secretary, this socialisation is essential because ULT plays a role as a front line barometer of stakeholders' satisfaction level.

“This activity of ULT is the frontline of public services at USU, which is also one of the barometers that measure the level of stakeholder satisfaction and public trust,” said Prof Fidel.

After this, all stakeholders, particularly in the USU environment, will have the availability of services and accurate information more quickly and efficiently.

Confirming the statement of the Secretary of the University, the Head of ULT USU said that there were only 25 types of services from 2018-2022. In 2023, the services are increased to 68 kinds of services. Work units within USU are expected to be aware of the 43 new types of services.

"In 2022-2023, we will be able to increase the number of services to 68 services, and today we are socializing these types of services so that work units can be aware and also participate in providing other services at USU," said the Head of the USU Integrated Service Unit.

ULT also continues to receive input on new services so that each service provided becomes more efficient without ignoring the terms and conditions of ULT.

"It is hoped that in addition to these 68 services, we can also provide new services so that later the work unit does not need to meet directly with users. We will act as the term "to help the type of verification of services or the type of requirements that exist"," he added.

During this activity, there was also a symbolic handover of the ULT Service Standard Guidebook to deans, directors, heads of bureaus, heads of units and ASA staff who attended this socialization.
