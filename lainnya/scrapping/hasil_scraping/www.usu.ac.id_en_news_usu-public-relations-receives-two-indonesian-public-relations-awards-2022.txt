“This Indonesian Public Relations Award encourages USU to continue to innovate in the USU information program for the community. Hopefully, public relations innovation at USU will become an open terrace for the community so that education in Indonesia will be better,” he said.

USU PR - The Office of Public Relations, Promotion, and Protocol of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has again made brilliant achievements in the national public relations award event. This time, USU Public Relations won two awards in Anugerah Humas Indonesia (AHI) 2022 for the Best PPID category with a Silver Winner and Best Magazine with a Bronze Winner.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., accompanied by Vice Rector II M. Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP. and Head of the Office of Public Relations, Promotion and Protocol Amalia Meutia M.Psi., Psychologist who was present directly to receive the award which was held on Friday (28/10/2022) night in Malang City, East Java, said that the achievements obtained were efforts and prayers to make USU more informative as has been assessed by Indonesian Public Relations through the awarding of the Indonesian Public Relations Award in the PPI category and USU Magazine.

“This Indonesian Public Relations Award encourages USU to continue to innovate in the USU information program for the community. Hopefully, public relations innovations at USU will become an open terrace for the community so that education in Indonesia will be better,” he said.

Head of the Office of Public Relations, Promotion, and Protocol Amalia Meutia M.Psi, Psychologist, said that USU Public Relations should be proud of this achievement, but not as a final achievement. This pride is actually a motivation for us to develop further in promoting and creating better USU branding next year while making brilliant achievements.

PPID USU itself, he added, was only established in 2019, which 2 years later showed a significant improvement so that it managed to get the title “Informative”, the highest level of information disclosure for public bodies. Then this year PPID USU's achievements shot up by making an achievement as the Best PPID from Public Relations Indonesia. This proves that PPID USU has had a positive impact on society.

“We would like to thank the Organizers of the Indonesian Public Relations Award for the appreciation and trust given to USU. Of course, this achievement is the result of the hard work of the USU Public Relations Team which is fully supported by the leaders and all USU academicians,” he said.

Anugerah Humas Indonesia (AHI) initiated by Humas Indonesia, part of the PR Indonesia Group, which is an annual competition and appreciation event for the performance of government public relations in ministries, local governments, universities, BUMN, BUMN subsidiaries, and BUMD throughout Indonesia.

Founder and CEO of PR Indonesia Asmono Wikan appreciated the contribution of public relations people, who now hold important positions in an institution.

“I appreciate the role and contribution of public relations people for best practices in communication strategies, which greatly affect the reputation and success of an institution,” said Asmono.

He explained that the AHI event in 2022 was the fourth since it was first held. And this year there are 58 public agencies participating with 286 category entries. Also attending the event were Minister of Agriculture Dr. H Syahrul Yasin Limpo, Mayor of Malang and others.
