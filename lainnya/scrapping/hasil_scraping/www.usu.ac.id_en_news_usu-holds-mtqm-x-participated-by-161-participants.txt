"We hope by having this we are able to train ourselves to be competed at a higher level after the competition at university," said Muryanto Amin.

USU Public Relations - The Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a USU-level Student Musabaqoh Tilawatil Qur'an (MTQM) which was officially opened by USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si on Friday (10/7/2022) at the USU Student Center, this activity will take place for 3 days in a row until (10/9/2022).

 

With the theme "Through MTQ We Create Students Who Have Al-Qur'an Spirits to Improve the Generation of Qur'anic Achievers", USU MTQM 2022 became MTQM X which was held by USU. Consisting of 10 competitions, MTQM X was attended by 161 participants.

 

The Rector said that this activity can train participants at a higher level of competition, so that after winning a competition at university, students can meet students from other universities who are trained to have religious studies since childhood.

"We hope by having this we are able to train ourselves to be competed at a higher level after the competition at university," said Muryanto Amin.

 

This activity is expected to have a positive impact on USU, especially on achievement. In addition, the implementation of USU MTQM went smoothly and produced the best Qori.

 

This activity is USU's step in preparing delegates to take part in a competition held by the Ministry of National Achievement Center (Puspresnas) every odd year. Besides being a form of appreciation, this activity is also to look for talent seeds in the MTQ field.

 

According to the Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations of USU, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe S.E., M.Sc. MTQM is a place to strengthen the faith and devotion of students and lecturers at USU.

 

"That's our way of preparing the USU delegation of national students held by the Ministry of National Achievement (Puspresnas) which is usually in odd years," said Doli.

 

The Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations explained that the Coordinator of the Spiritual, Literacy, Arts, and Culture Unit routinely provides guidance and assistance for MTQ talents found at USU.

"We have a coordinator for 4 clusters, a Coordinator for Literacy, Arts, Culture, and Spirituality led by Mr. Afifudin. This has always been routine and we do ask for routine guidance and assistance for MTQ talents at USU," he explained.

 

In line with this, the Coordinator of the Unit for Spirituality, Literacy, Arts, and Culture Afifudin Dalimunthe, S.P., M.P explained that around 161 participants from various faculties at USU will take part in 14 competitions which are expected to be the forerunner of the national student MTQ selection.

 

"We hope that all of these will become our resources from USU, the forerunner to the national selection of MTQ students next year, perhaps," said Afifudin.

 

Afifudin Dalimunthe S.P.,M.P advised the participants to straighten their intentions and try as much as possible with the Qur'an because the Qur'an is something very sacred. (©ULC)
