USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) will participate in the Monev Public Test of Public Information Disclosure in 2024 organized by the Central Information Commission (KI), on November 13, 2024.

USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., said, as one of the state institutions that carry out the duties of the Tri Dharma of Education, USU needs to demonstrate its commitment in supporting transparency and accountability. “This public test is very good for USU, through public tests it will be seen how USU's commitment and implementation in supporting transparency and accountability within the university. USU's participation in this public test is also USU's support for information disclosure in order to increase public trust,” said Prof. Mury in his statement, Monday (11/11/2024) in Medan.

Prof. Mury said, the Information Commission will provide an assessment of a number of aspects related to transparency and accountability, such as how the quality that USU conveys, what types of information are open to the public, and what facilities and infrastructure to support and support public transparency.

The USU Rector himself in his presentation in the public test has prepared several points related to the implementation of accountability and information disclosure.

Among these is the establishment of the organizational structure of the Information and Documentation Management Officer (PPID) which provides information openly to the public. USU has also integrated an information system called Satu Data USU.

“One Data USU is expected to be a source of accurate data truth with easy and coordinated access, standardized and supporting data-based policies,” said Prof. Mury.

In addition, PPID USU also innovated digitization by providing a Parent Portal (Satu Wali). Namely a service portal for parents that contains complete information related to student academic activities such as grades, attendance and personal development.

“This parent portal will also be a means of communication between USU and parents or guardians, where parents can monitor the academic progress of their children studying at USU in an accurate and transparent manner,” said Prof. Mury.

USU has also prepared several other excellent PPID programs, such as facilities and infrastructure, digitalization and an integrated system.

“USU has formulated a combination of clear policies, advanced digitalization strategies, and complete infrastructure to strengthen USU's position as an educational institution that supports public information disclosure as a foundation in creating a quality world of education,” said USU Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin.
