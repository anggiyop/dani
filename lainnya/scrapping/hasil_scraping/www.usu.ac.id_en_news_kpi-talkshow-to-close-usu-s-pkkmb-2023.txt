If our topic today is 'Healthy Smart Broadcasting, Peaceful Election 2024' then KPI must be assisted by fellow students, and young people to ensure that broadcasts in Indonesia are healthy so that Indonesia is smart. True knowledge is not only on campus, but knowledge is what we put into ourselves. Including the spectacles and shows that we put into our heads," said the Chairman of Commission I DPR.

USU PR - The closing of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) New Student Campus Introduction (PKKMB) began with a Fun Walk, Launching the Anniversary Logo then a Talkshow with the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI), on Sunday (20/08/2023).

The Healthy Walk or what is also called the Fun Walk starts at the USU Rectorate Building and ends at the same place. This Fun Walk has the theme "Healthy Walk Supports Academic Healthy USU".

At the closing of PKKMB, it was also the launching of the 71st USU Anniversary.

The last day of PKKMB activities was then continued with the presence of the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI) by enlivening the One Million Viewers Literacy Movement. By presenting a talk show with the theme 'Healthy Broadcasts for the Public, Keep the Election Peaceful 2024'.

Chairperson of Commission I DPR RI, Meutya Viada Hafid, said that the topic raised at this event was aimed at guarding young people to be healthy on social media.

"If our topic today is 'Healthy Smart Broadcasting, Peaceful Election 2024' then KPI must be assisted by fellow students, and young people to guard that broadcasts in Indonesia are healthy, so that in Indonesia this is smart. True knowledge is not only on campus, but knowledge is what we put into ourselves. Including the spectacles and shows that we put into our heads," said the Chairman of Commission I DPR.

In line with that, USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., also said that Fun Walk activities with Healthy Broadcast activities are very in line because healthy people will use social media healthily too.

"We have started this event with a fun walk. Fun Walk around half of this USU campus. This fun walk indicates whether we are healthy or not because the theme taken at this time is healthy broadcasting. One of the characteristics of a healthy person is walking more than 2 KM, which is quite healthy. If they can walk stably, that's a sign of health. Healthy exercise results in a healthy mind too. That's the message from this event that I want to convey," said Prof. Mury.

USU has also achieved this by supporting the spread of broadcasting literacy records with the most participants.

Chairman of the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI), Ubaidillah, said he hoped that with this talk show, USU students would become agents to promote healthy digital literacy.

"This literacy is because we have also entered the digital era, in the future students, and generations can become agents of goodness in their respective environments regarding this digital message," he said.
