The Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations said that this activity was related to IKU 1 and was in line with USU phase 2 strategic plan, namely increasing the percentage of alumni who continued their studies abroad. This inspiring activity is expected to support USU vision and mission in the internationalization strategy plan.

USU Public Relations - Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Mini Edu Fair with the theme "Realize Dreams of Studying Abroad and Strategies to Get Scholarships".

The activity which aims to increase the capacity of prospective graduates who continue their studies is held in the Prof. Hall. Suhadji Hadibroto, USU's Faculty of Economics and Business on Thursday, (10/13/2022).

USU invited resource person Zaid P. Nasution, ST. MT. Ph.D as a graduate of the Doctoral program from the University of Leeds, UK and Mahmud Arief Albar, SS. MA as a Doctoral student at Glasgow University, Scotland. The resource persons at the Mini Edu Fair on this occasion discussed tips and tricks to get scholarships as well as the personal experiences of the speakers that should be put for the benefit of participants.

Vice Rector I for Academic, Student and Alumni Affairs, Universitas Sumatera Utara Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA appreciates this activity because it can bring students who want to get information on scholarships abroad closer to USU alumni who have studied at universities abroad.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA hopes that this Mini Edu Fair can motivate USU students, especially those in the final year who have the desire to continue their studies by utilizing the available scholarship facilities, so that they can make it happen in the near future.

“It is very interesting because they will talk about their experiences on how to prepare themselves to be able to get scholarships which are really competitive, right. Currently, there are many scholarship providers. But usually the strategy is almost the same," he said.

Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe, S.E., M.Si said that this activity was related to IKU 1 and was in line with USU's phase 2 strategic plan, which is to increase the percentage of alumni who continue their studies abroad. This inspiring activity is expected to support USU vision and mission in the internationalization strategy plan.

"This is actually a program that we are running starting this year related to IKU 1. So we are banging on and inviting the final year students who are present today to be able to prepare to continue their studies abroad," he said.

"Hopefully it can inspire and increase the percentage of USU alumni who continue their studies but abroad to support USU's vision and mission this time according to the internationalization strategic plan," he added. (©ULC)
