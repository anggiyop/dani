"Especially to fulfill the criteria or indicators in the assessment, which include: academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty/student ratio, and several other indicators,” said Prof. Rikson.

USU PR - The Faculty of Law (FH) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an Alumni Gathering with the theme “Faculty of Law USU Goes to Global” at Santika Premiere Dyandra Hotel & Convention on Saturday, (27/01/2024).

Prof. Rikson Asman Fertiles Siburian S.Si., M.Si., Ph.D as the Internationalization Program Manager of DIKG USU said that the alumni gathering activity was an effort by the faculty to support the internationalization program launched by the university.

Prof. Rikson also said that to be able to accelerate entry into the 500 World Class University (WCU) ranking requires solid support from all USU alumni.

“Especially to fulfill the criteria or indicators in the assessment, which include academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty/student ratio, and several other indicators,” said Prof. Rikson.

Prof. Rikson said that this year, USU was ranked the highest in obtaining funds from the ministry to raise the level. This year, USU received 39 billion in funding.

“This year, we get 44 billion in funding. After tax deductions, it is 39 billion,” said Prof. Rikson.

On a different occasion, the Dean of the Faculty of Law, Dr. Mahmul Siregar, SH, M.Hum. said that USU Faculty of Law has four study programs, with details of Undergraduate and Master's study programs accredited superior, Doctoral study programs accredited excellent, and notarial law study programs in the process of accreditation. The Dean also said that the law faculty's Undergraduate study program is participating in FIBAA international accreditation and is working on infrastructure development to meet international standards.

“This year, the Undergraduate will be internationally accredited, followed by international accreditation for Master's and Doctoral Law Science,” said the Dean.

The Dean also said there have been many collaborations between the Faculty of Law and alumni, including alumni teaching programs and seminars. The Dean also said that there were alumni who donated several rooms in the Faculty of Law.

“Then our alumni also donated several rooms in the faculty,” said the Dean of FH.

Finally, the General Secretary of the FH USU Alumni Association (IKA), Ahmad Sohari Damanik, SH, M.H, said that the international accreditation currently being sought will be well implemented if alumni take a role in supporting these efforts.

“It will be possible to be carried out well if the role of the alumni can be as much as possible to support the effort,” Ahmad said.
