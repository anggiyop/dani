The Dean of FKep said the strategy taken by FKep to achieve ZI-WBK was to consolidate with the team at FKep and coordinate with university leaders. The tridharma activities at FKep are also synchronized with the ZI-WBK program from the Kemenpan-RB.

PR USU - Faculty of Nursing (FKep) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received the title of Corruption-Free Regional Integrity Zone (ZI WBK) in 2022, after previously winning an award from the Ministry of Education and Research and Technology for the success of building ZI-WBK in 2021. This was conveyed by the Dean FKep Dr. Dudut Tanjung, SKp, M.Kep, Sp.KMB in the Socialization of Integrity Zone Development at the USU FKep Hall, Thursday (17/03/2022).

The Dean of FKep said the strategy taken by FKep to achieve ZI-WBK was to consolidate with the team at FKep and coordinate with university leaders. The tridharma activities at FKep are also synchronized with the ZI-WBK program from the Kemenpan-RB.

"Development of ZI-WBK in FKep is very useful in improving performance and fulfilling Key Performance Indicators (IKU), as well as achieving USU's FKep internal goals," said the dean.

He said that the ZI-WBK assessment includes two main things, FKep services that are free from KKN and public services. The elements of this assessment are divided into six, namely change management, management arrangement, HR management system arrangement, strengthening supervision, improving public services, and strengthening accountability.

“We always encourage the leading sector in each of these elements to work well. We carry out this mandate seriously and balanced in its operations," he said.

Bureau of Organization and Administration of the Ministry of Education and Culture-Research and Technology Yudi Pramudianto, S.Sos., who was the speaker in this socialization, explained that one of the important things that must be done is to strengthen intimacy with service users, be it lecturers, students or alumni.

"With this, the service assessment of FKep will be better because service recipients judge whether USU's FKep deserves this title," said Yudi.

He added that leaders and all the layers involved also need to understand that FKep is trying to build ZI-WBK. It is hoped that the entire academic community will support USU, especially FKep, in getting this predicate.

"Without ZI-WBK in FKep there is no corruption, but ZI WBK needs to be built as a control effort so that in the future in FKep there will really be no more corruption," he concluded.
