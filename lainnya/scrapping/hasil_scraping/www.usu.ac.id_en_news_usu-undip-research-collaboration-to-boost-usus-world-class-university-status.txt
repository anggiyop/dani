Research collaboration is crucial for generating academically relevant knowledge that benefits society. Combining both aspects can enhance research capacity and expand the scope of scientific publications, thereby increasing global recognition of USU's History program.

USU PR — Under the theme "Research and Publication Collaboration Towards a World Class University," the Master’s Program in History at the Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Doctoral Program in History at the Faculty of Cultural Sciences Universitas Diponegoro (UNDIP) have officially established a research partnership. The collaboration was formalized with the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) on Thursday, Aug. 15, 2024, in the FIB USU meeting room.

 

This event is not only an opportunity for sharing knowledge and experience but also a significant milestone in building a strategic partnership, according to Prof. Dr. Dra. T. Thyrhaya Zein, M.A., Dean of FIB USU, represented by Mhd. Pujiono, S.S., M.Hum., Ph.D., Vice Dean III of FIB USU. The collaboration is an effort to address global challenges where research and scientific publications are key indicators of the success of higher education institutions.

“USU is already ranked internationally, as is UNDIP. Therefore, we initiated this collaboration to improve quality and capacity through joint research efforts,” said Mhd. Pujiono, S.S., M.Hum., Ph.D.

 

As a discipline focused on past studies, the History Program plays a vital role in addressing contemporary issues. Dr. Haryono Kanari, M.Hum., Head of the Doctoral Program in History at UNDIP, agreed that understanding societal changes is crucial through history. Learning from past experiences helps shape national values.

 

Dr. Kanari also discussed topics for the general lecture, including historical research methods, the role of history, understanding cultural identity, and the challenges of historical studies in the digital era.

 

“Through this general lecture, we hope the speakers can provide new perspectives and a broader understanding of the importance of history, inspiring USU’s Master's students to pursue further studies,” added Dr. Kanari.

 

Prior to this, a consortium collaboration among deans across Indonesia was established. UNDIP lecturers were invited to be speakers in various programs at FIB USU. In addition to fostering research collaboration, this partnership aims to motivate USU’s Master’s students to continue their studies at UNDIP, expanding their knowledge and interests in the field of history.
