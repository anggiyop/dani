The USU Rector said that the visitation of the UNS was carried out in order to strengthen the relationship between the two PTN-BH, as well as conduct small discussions related to the management of the fields of human resources, finance, and logistics.

PR USU – Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos M.Si received the visitation from the Commission on Human Resources (HR), Finance and Logistics of Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). The meeting took place in the Academic Senate Room, USU Central Bureau Building, on Monday (30/05/2022).

The USU Rector said that the UNS's visitation was carried out to strengthen the relationship between the two PTN-BH and conduct small discussions related to the management of the fields of human resources, finance, and logistics.

“These three important areas are work units that are quite vital in supporting the course of all university programs and policies. In fact, on this occasion, the USU also needs to discuss and share information related to the management of these fields at UNS," said the USU Rector.

The Rector of USU hopes that this activity can be a means for both universities to provide quality information and input and support the improvement of campus performance, especially in the three areas mentioned.

"We hope that this activity will be able to provide good and quality information and input for the two universities. So that we could improve the performance and management of the three work units and support the improvement of the university's overall achievement," said Muryanto Amin.

Prof. Dr. Suwarto, S.H., M.H as the Chair of the USU Academic Senate, said there will be a return visit to UNS because UNS is part of the PTN-BH.

"We, the USU Senate, will visit PTN-BH, definitely a return visit to UNS. We have been scheduled for a few months to have regular visits," said Prof. Suwarto.

In addition, he added that to advance USU, the two universities have collaborated in matters relating to the adaptation of HR and financial management.

"Yes, we have collaborated for the common good," added Prof. Suwarto.

On the same occasion, the Chair of the UNS Academic Senate, Prof. Dr. Adi Sulistiyono, S.H., M.H. said that the arrival of the UNS to USU was because USU was one of the senior PTN-BH. So he wanted to learn about three related work units, especially forest management.

"Alhamdulillah, our HR management is almost the same because we are a university from the government. We can be independent, but later, we will ask for more about forest management," explained Prof. Adi.

He said that the well-managed USU forest system could accommodate the management of UNS's forest, which covers an area of ​​150 hectares. However, both have advantages due to different Government Regulations (PP).

"If USU has its own PP and everything that regulates the government, we just have to run it. With us coming here later, God willing, we can develop the UNS forest that we have managed so far," added Prof. Adi.

At the end, Prof. Adi said that later both parties could accelerate so that the target for PTN-BH can be met to rank world-class university.
