“However, after today's celebration, a professor must add to the products of his three tasks as well as being an inspiration for other lecturer colleagues,” said Prof. Mury.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) again held a Permanent Professor Inauguration Ceremony at the Student Center on Thursday (19/12/2024). This year, out of 73 proposals, 24 were approved and decrees issued, while 51 other proposals were recommended. This is also the largest addition of professors in USU's history.

 

There are 5 professors who were inaugurated in today's procession, including Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Rusda, M.Ked(OG), Sp.OG(K), Prof. Dr. dr. Lambok Siahaan, MKT, Sp.KKLP, Sp.ParK, M.BioEt, Prof. Dr. dr. Siska Mayasari Lubis, M.Ked(Ped), Sp.A(K), Prof. Dr. dr. Sry Suryani Widjaja, M.Kes., Prof. Dr. dr. Amira Permatasari Tarigan, M.Ked(Paru), Sp.P(K). The five professors come from the USU Faculty of Medicine.

 

In his speech, USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si stated that the inauguration of professors is not only a celebration, but also a responsibility to produce innovations that have an impact on society and industry.

 

“However, after today's celebration, a professor must add to the products of his or her three tasks as well as being an inspiration for other lecturer colleagues,” said Prof. Mury.

 

The Rector also emphasized the importance of collaboration between academia and industry to create sustainable and world-recognized innovations. The Rector is optimistic that with 184 active professors, USU will soon reach the standard of a world-class university.

 

“Thus, collaboration is very important for every professor when carrying out tridarma duties,” said the rector.

 

One of the inaugurated professors, Prof. Dr. dr. Sry Suryani Widjaja, M.Kes., said that USU has shown significant progress in medical education with a focus on going international. One of the important steps being taken is to increase the number of scientific publications, including research manuscripts, to strengthen USU's position at the global level.

 

“We are heading towards internationalization, for example we at USU are trying to increase the number of manuscript publications and others,” said Sry.

 

He further said that USU has started research collaboration with renowned institutions abroad, such as Singapore, and plans further collaboration with world-leading universities.

 

“In the future, we plan to cooperate again with leading universities in the world,” he said.
