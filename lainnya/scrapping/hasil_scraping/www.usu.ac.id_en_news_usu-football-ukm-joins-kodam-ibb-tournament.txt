USU Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked (OG), Sp. OG (K)-Fer said that USU is one of the state universities that has a football club. In 2017, USU entered the third national soccer league.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Football Sports Student Activity Unit (UKM) participated in a tournament held by Kodam I in commemoration of the 72nd anniversary of Kodam I Bukit Barisan and the 76th anniversary of the Army Military Police on Monday (13/06/2022). The activity was held at Kodam I Bukit Barisan.

USU Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked (OG), Sp. OG (K)-Fer said that USU is one of the state universities that has a football club. In 2017, USU entered the third national soccer league.

In commemorating the anniversary of Kodam I Bukit Barisan, he hopes that through soccer, USU can send its students to become representatives of soccer athletes in the 2024 National Sports Week (PON) event.

“Hopefully, USU will have students who can become athletes and take part in the soccer competition in the 2024 PON event,” he said.

The USU Secretary also said that if there are USU students who have the potential to become football athletes, coaching will be carried out by the Vice Rector I for Academic, Student Affairs, and Alumni Affairs. With coaching, it is hoped that USU students can revive the name of the USU soccer club to the national arena.

“With this coaching, it is hoped that students will play seriously and will be supervised by the Vice Rector I,” he said.

In his remarks, Commander of the Bukit Barisan (BB) I Military Region Command (Pangdam) Major General TNI Achmad Daniel Chardin said that in this commemoration event there would also be various competitions, namely volleyball, soccer, cycling, executive and sniper shooting competitions.

“After the pandemic, finally, Kodam I bukit barisan can celebrate its birthday again with various competitions,” he said.

Pangdam I BB also said that this activity will revive positive community activities and is one of the events for selecting superior soccer athletes who will later play at the city or even provincial level. Therefore, during the match, he hopes that players and referees uphold sportsmanship.

“Hopefully, we will find superior seeds that can play in PON 2024,” he said.
