Vice-Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., MA said that the final schedule for the SNMPTN registration is getting closer. The schedule for the school will end on February 8, 2022, and the schedule for students will end on February 15, 2022.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Socialization and Promotion of the 2022 SNMPTN and UTBK-SBMPTN by directly presenting the Chair of the Higher Education Entrance Test Institute (LTMPT), Prof. Dr. Ir. Mochamad Ashari, M.Eng, Ph.D.

Held online on Friday (04/02/2022), this activity was carried out to further clarify information and understanding to the Principals of SMA/SMK/Equivalent who act as guides, operators, and final grade students who will take part in the 2022 SNMPTN.

Vice-Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., MA said that the final schedule for the SNMPTN registration is getting closer. The schedule for the school will end on February 8, 2022, and the schedule for students will end on February 15, 2022.

"Where the LTMPT account registration schedule for PDSS and SNMPTN is only a matter of fingers," he said.

However, VR I added, there are still many schools and students who have not registered until today. This is partly due to ignorance and lack of understanding due to the lack of information obtained.

"If so, this is certainly very unfortunate, and we expect the school to be able to register immediately so that students who are interested in continuing their education at state universities do not become disadvantaged due to ignoring or delaying registration," he said.

With this socialization, Dr. Edy Ikhsan hopes that school principals can carry out their role optimally in helping to increase the number of students who register in the selection of new students, especially at USU through the SNMPTN and SBMPTN pathways in 2022.

"All information that has not been fully understood can become clearer, especially for school principals and students who are present today," he explained.

On that occasion, Dr. Edy Ikhsan also said that USU currently has 15 faculties and 1 graduate school. Consist of 163 study programs; 11 study programs with excellent accreditation categories, 59 study programs accredited A, 6 study programs accredited very well, 75 study programs accredited B, 5 study programs accredited well, 1 study program accredited C, and 6 study programs in the re-accreditation process.

"We hope that your students can be part of the new students who have seats at USU in 2022," he said.
