"This program is an activity of USU Scouts together with LPPM USU and is expected to be the start of the upcoming community service of USU Scouts," said Achmad Delianur.

SILALAHI-HUMAS USU: The Student Activity Unit of the Medan City Scout Movement Cluster Front 08.137 and 08.138 Based on Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held community service activities in Silalahi II Village, Silahisabungan District, Dairi Regency, North Sumatra on Friday-Saturday (16-17/12/2022). The activity was attended by at least 20 students and coaches who are members of the Student Activity Unit. 

Also participating at the event was the Head of the 08-137 Cluster, Dr. Ar. Achmad Delianur Nasution, ST, MT, IAI, AA, IAP, who is also a Lecturer at USU's Faculty of Engineering, mentioned that this activity synergizes with USU's Society for Community Service. In the future, he hopes this will be the o be the start of the upcoming community service.

"This program is an activity of USU Scouts together with LPPM USU and is expected to be the start of the upcoming community service of USU Scouts," said Achmad Delianur.

He also explained that scouts exist not only from elementary school up to high school. Scouts are present in all age groups all the way through university. This makes Scout training a lifelong character-building activity. 

" Scouts not only exist in elementary to high school but also in universities. Specifically in universities, the focus of scout activities is in line with a point of Tri Dharma, community service. Therefore, we come here to implement lifelong character-building education and contribute to society," he said.

The Chief of Silalahi II Village, Belman, also appreciated USU Scouts' presence in carrying out community service. He mentioned that their village needs more collaboration with many stakeholders. 

"We are very grateful for this program initiated by USU Scouts. We admit that there needs to be more encouragement for the community to be environmentally conscious. In addition, I also hope that this cooperation will pave the way for other collaborations," said Belman.

Raising the title of Environmental Awareness to Improve SDGs of Silalahi II Village, USU Scouts held a series of community service activities. First, the socialization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) 12: Responsible consumption and production, was carried out by the Chairman of the USU Scout Racana Council, Roni Hikmah Ramadhan, S.S., M.A. to provide understanding and awareness to the village community about the importance of protecting the environment. 

Afterwards, the USU Scout service team and the Silalahi II Village community worked together to clean up the village area and build garbage disposal facilities at several designated village points. The activity was lively as elementary school students who had just received their report cards also participated. The activity was then concluded with a friendly gathering with the villagers.
