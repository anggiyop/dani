"Alhamdulillah, thanks to the collaboration in every work unit from the study program level to the university, we managed to meet the requirements set so that we managed to achieve Superior Accreditation," USU Rector Dr Muryanto Amin said.

HUMAS USU – Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has won the Superior Accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Higher Education (BAN-PT) as stated in the BAN-PT certificate no. 1517/SK/BAN-PT/Ak.KP/PT/IX/2022 signed by the Executive Board of Prof. Ari Purbayanto, PhD. This college accreditation certificate is valid from 27 September 2022 to 27 February 2023.

 USU Rector Dr Muryanto Amin, SSos, MSi said, Excellent Accreditation is the highest accreditation rating obtained by universities that meet the BAN-PT criteria. 

"Alhamdulillah, thanks to the collaboration in every work unit, from the study program level to the university, we managed to meet the requirements set so that we succeeded in achieving Superior Accreditation," USU Rector Dr Muryanto Amin said in his statement, Wednesday (09/28/2022). 

The Rector hopes that the achievement of Superior Accreditation from BAN-PT can inspire the entire academic community to continue to provide the best for the Universitas Sumatera Utara. 

"The current accreditation process is monitored regularly every month through the Higher Education Database (PDDikti). So we must keep our spirits up in carrying out the tasks of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education," said Mury.

Superior Accreditation is obtained because of the contribution of all work units at USU, including members of the Board of Trustees (MWA), Academic Senate (SA), Board of Professors (DGB), lecturers, students, alumni, and USU partners. 

"We still need focused and consistent work so that we can all produce our own innovative works to achieve USU's improvement towards 500 QS WUR. Thank you for the cooperation and hopefully continue to work in a comfortable and peaceful atmosphere so that we can continue to be productive," he said. 

For information, universities or study programs that get Excellent Accreditation are universities that are very good about their achievements and get a score of more than 361 and meet the Requirements for Superior Ranking. 

There are several requirements to get the Superior Accreditation predicate, including valid evidence related to good practice of developing research culture in universities, the acquisition of study program accreditation status, the effectiveness of implementation, and the number of publications in journals in the last 3 years. 

Based on data from BAN-PT, currently only 27 universities in Indonesia have achieved Excellent Accreditation. USU, which has just won the title of Superior Accreditation, has then fulfilled it, so that now the number of accredited superior universities is 28 universities. (©ULC)
