The Department of Pediatrics Sp-1, previously accredited A, in the old terminology, of course we hope that this will be superior, so that it can increase the ranking of the Universitas Sumatera Utara," said Prof. Fidel.

Public Relation USUs - LAM-PTKes conducted an offline field assessment of the Sp-1 Study Program in Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine (FK) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). The opening of the assessment activities took place at USU's Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday (11/30/2022).

The presence of two assessor teams from LAM-PTKes Prof. Dr. dr. Max FJ Mantik, Sp. A (K) and dr. Gst Ayu Putu Nilawati, Sp. A (K), MARS was welcomed by USU University Secretary Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked(OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp.F.E.R . According to the USU University Secretary, USU's FK already has 7 study programs that are accredited superior, so it is expected that the Department of Child Health Sciences Sp-1 can add to the ranks of study programs that are accredited superior. Previously, the Study Program of Pediatrics Sp-1 itself was accredited A or Very Good.

"The Department of Pediatrics Sp-1, previously accredited A, in the old terminology, of course we hope this will be superior, so that it can increase the ranking of the Universitas Sumatera Utara," Prof. Fidel stated.

Assessor I Prof. Dr. dr. Max FJ Mantik, Sp. A (K) was of the opinion that USU's Faculty of Medicine had extraordinary achievements. He said in this assessment he would see and directly evaluate reports, work documents, and a comprehensive self-evaluation. Prof. Dr. dr. Max FJ Mantik, Sp.A (K) assessed that the discussion on the assessment process for the Sp-1 Study Program in USU's FK Pediatrics would run smoothly.

"Because this is only the paper that we are seeing, we haven't seen it later in the discussion later. But if I look at this situation the discussion will go well, that's from me," Prof. Max said.

Assessor II dr. Gst Ayu Putu Nilawati, Sp. A (K), MARS explained that the assessment contained in this field assessment had 9 criteria that would be monitored directly in detail to ensure whether the events in the field match reality.

"So in short it's like this, in the era of Facebook and Instagram, we see whether this is using a filter or not? Now, let's see the reality, hopefully yesterday didn't use a filter, we can see the original. So there are several assessments, there are 9 criteria that we assess," he explained.

On the same occasion, the Dean of USU's FK Prof. Dr. dr. Aldy Safruddin Rambe, Sp.S(K) said that his faculty always made good preparations for all study programs including the Sp-1 Study Program in Pediatrics to achieve the best accreditation. (©ULC)
