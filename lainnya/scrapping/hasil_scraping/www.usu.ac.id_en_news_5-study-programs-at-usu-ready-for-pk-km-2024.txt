Five study programs were selected. This is expected to be an example of the implementation of the Independent Campus Competition program. The example mentioned is if, for example, the 5 study programs are successful in the process, proposal, implementation, and evaluation in this PK-KM," said the USU Rector.

USU PR- Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) conducted a socialization program for the Campus Merdeka Competition (PK-KM) 2024. The socialization event took place in the Senate Academic Room on Thursday (2/11/2023).

This program is part of the Ministry of Education and Culture's initiative to support the improvement of the quality and relevance of education at each university. For the Campus Merdeka Competition (PK-KM) 2024, USU is represented by five study programs from five faculties. These study programs include the Bachelor's program in Forestry, the Bachelor's program in Pharmacy, the Bachelor's program in English Literature, the Bachelor's program in Agribusiness, and the Bachelor's program in Chemical Engineering.

Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., the Rector of USU, mentioned that Kampus Merdeka brings a new transformational process in the Tri Dharma activities for students and lecturers to adjust to the standards set by the Ministry of Education and Culture.

“Five study programs were selected. This is expected to be an example of the implementation of the Independent Campus Competition program. The example mentioned is if, for example, the 5 study programs are successful in the process, proposal, implementation, and evaluation in this PK-KM," said the USU Rector.

The Rector also added that this serves as a reference for planning programs, which are then implemented and reviewed for the future.

"So, how is the process in the study program, starting from when a student enrolls until they graduate? It must meet the skills standards that the study program must prepare. That is the change; that is the transformation," he added.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., Vice Rector I for Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, and Alumni at USU, mentioned that the university's future plans include planning activities that can improve the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of the university.

"Because this program has a time-bound aspect of when it should be uploaded, there is a process for mentoring, proposal preparation, then there will be feedback, scot analysis, various processes," explained Vice-Rector I.

Dr. Dra. Mahriyuni, M.Hum., a member of the USU PK-KM Team, conveyed that according to the 2020 Ministry of Education and Culture Regulation on Campus Merdeka, it aims to improve the quality of lecturers, the quality of graduates and the management of learning and the curriculum.

"We really hope that the Universitas Sumatera Utara can participate this year and successfully qualify at the study program level," she said.
