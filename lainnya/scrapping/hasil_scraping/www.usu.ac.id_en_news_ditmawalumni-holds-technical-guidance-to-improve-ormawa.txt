In this technical guidance, we hope to provide changes in the perspective of managing and fostering the Student Units at USU, said Doli.

HUMAS USU - The Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations (Ditmawalumni) of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held Technical Guidance (BIMTEK) for Student Units (UKM) 2023, Saturday (18/02/2023). Located in Mieke Wijaya Hall FEB USU, this activity was attended by each chairman and secretary of UKM listed at USU.

The activity began with remarks delivered by the Director of the Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe S.E., M.Si. He underlined the need for transformation regarding student organisations' governance and work plans.

“In this technical guidance, we hope to provide changes in the perspective of managing and fostering the Student Units at USU,” said Doli.

For this reason, through this technical guidance, Ditmawalumni and the USU Student Achievement Centre (Puspresma) will work together to assist each Student Organisation in building student character and making achievements. This is in accordance with the new tagline "Character, Creativity, Champion", echoed by Ditmawalumni.

In addition, the Director of Ditawalumni revealed that he would guide the members of student organisations so that these activities would be beneficial, especially in building the character of STARS in accordance with USU's vision and mission.

"The process starts from coaching until he wins an achievement if the student unit focuses on achievement. Then, if the student unit does not focus on achievement, we will assist so that the activity is useful to form the character of STARS according to USU's vision and mission," he explained.

Of course, this massive overhaul of student organisation governance is challenging for Ditmawalumni and Puspresma. Dr. Ir. Emmy Harso Kardhinata M.Sc, Chairperson of the USU Student Achievement Centre (Puspresma), hopes that her unit can support and assist Ditmawalumni's duties, especially in terms of fostering student organisations.

"To achieve all of that is very difficult, so Ditmawa opened a new division in Puspresma. Hopefully, this can support all programmes from Ditmawa," said the Chairperson of Puspresma USU.

The Technical Guidance for Student Unit 2023 is the first time this has been done and will be scheduled as a routine activity for student organisations with Ditmalumni. The 2023 Student Activity Unit technical guidance invited Arif Qaedi Hutagalung SE., M.Si and Raju Ritonga, S.P as presenters.
