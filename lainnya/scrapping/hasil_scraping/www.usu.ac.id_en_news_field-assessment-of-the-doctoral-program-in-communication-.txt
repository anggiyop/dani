"Our Doctoral program is still new, established in 2020, but the public's trust in this study program has increased. The first three cohorts had eight students, and now there are 15. USU will continue to support the development of all study programs to achieve even better assessments," said Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

USU PR — Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from the National Accreditation Agency for Higher Education (BAN-PT) Assessment Team for the Field Assessment of the Doctoral Program in Communication Studies at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) USU. The activity took place in the Theater Room of FISIP USU on Thursday (Apr. 25, 2024).

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., Vice Rector I of USU, welcomed the arrival of the two BAN PT assessors, Prof. Dr. Suwandi Sumartias, M.Si., from Universitas Padjadjaran and Dr. Irwansyah, M.A., from Universitas Indonesia.

In his speech, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., mentioned that the newly established Doctoral Program in Communication Studies at FISIP USU has shown improvement since 2020, as seen from the significant increase in the number of participants. He expressed that the university will continue to support the development of all study programs to improve assessments.

"Our Doctoral program is still new, established in 2020, but the public's trust in this study program has increased. The first three cohorts had eight students, and now there are 15. USU will continue to support the development of all study programs to achieve even better assessments," said Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

Furthermore, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., hoped that this visit would provide an opportunity for discussion and to listen to the views of the attending experts. The evaluation from external parties would provide a comprehensive perspective on the study program and the necessary steps to improve accreditation.

"We hope that meaningful input can be provided during this visitation for the development of this study program. There is a platform for discussion and listening to the experts. The external evaluation is more comprehensive and can improve accreditation," expressed Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., M.S.P., Dean of FISIP USU, stated that this assessment aims to achieve the best results. Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., M.S.P., emphasized the importance of reaching good quality standards, which would open opportunities for improving other programs.

"The target is to achieve the best results because, as a new program, the current accreditation is at the minimum level. So, we aim for at least a good level, or even excellence, which will allow us to enhance other programs. This assessment confirms the data and reports we have submitted. If additional data is needed, it will be added," explained Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., M.S.P.
