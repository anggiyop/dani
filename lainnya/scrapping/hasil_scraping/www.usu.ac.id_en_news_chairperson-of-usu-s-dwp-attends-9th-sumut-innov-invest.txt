Also accompanying the Deputy Chairperson of DWP USU, Sri Rahayu Kartini Edy Ikhsan and Deputy Secretary Sriyanti Wahyuni Hasibuan.

North Sumatra Governor Edy Rahmayadi officially opened the 9th North Sumatra Innovation and Investment Week. In his remarks, the Governor of North Sumatra invited all domestic and foreign investors to seize the investment potential that exists in North Sumatra, whether in infrastructure, agriculture, livestock and food. Edy Rahmayadi requested that the North Sumatra Innovation and Investment Week should not only be a ceremonial event but can affect investment in North Sumatra. To the consulates present, Edy Rahmayadi also asked for ideas and cooperation, which can be carried out in the future.

The activity held the theme "Increasing Plantation Downstream and Empowering MSME Partnerships as a Stimulus for North Sumatra's Economy". Also present were the North Sumatra Province Secretary Arief S Trinugroho, Consulates General and Honorary Consuls of Friendly Countries in Medan, the Coordinating Forum for Regional Leaders, Regents/Mayors throughout North Sumatra, Rectors of Universities, North Sumatra Chamber of Commerce and Industry, local governments in North Sumatra, Dharma Wanita and entrepreneurs who participated in the exhibition.

Faisal Arif Nasution, Head of the North Sumatra Investment and One-Stop Integrated Service Office, said that this year's North Sumatra Innovation and Investment Week activities aim to become a forum for information about investment and regional potential, create effective and objective promotional media about regional development, promote strategic and potential products, and showcase the creative and innovative work of the community. He hopes that products downstream will be able to open new jobs, increase value, increase foreign exchange, and keep the trade balance positive. Thus, the commercialization of various potential regional commodities must continue to be encouraged.

After the event, the Chairperson of DWP USU, Novi Susanti Muryanto Amin, took the time to review the stalls of regional innovation and creativity products and buy several products of interest. The wife of the Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara appreciated the successful event. She hoped that similar activities could be held more often to capture the potential of leading MSMEs in North Sumatra to contribute to improving the community's economy and encouraging MSME products to level up to the global market.

The exhibition booths that participated in the 9th North Sumatra Innovation and Investment Week 2023 consisted of representatives of MSMEs from regencies/cities in North Sumatra and various other government partner companies. The activity, which lasted until Friday (5/26/2023), was also attended by various arts and cultural attractions from North Sumatra.
