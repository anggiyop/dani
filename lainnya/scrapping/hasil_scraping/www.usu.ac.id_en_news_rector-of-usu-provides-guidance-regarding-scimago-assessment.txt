"This guidance activity will be conducted across all faculties and study programs at USU, with the aim of fostering the development of high-quality human resources within the institution," stated the USU rector.

USU PR — University rankings play a crucial role in the continuous development of creating high-quality universities. This objective was pursued through the implementation of the Human Resources Quality Improvement Guidance at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), led by the Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., at the Digital Learning Centre Building on Friday (Apr.19, 2024).

 

In the 2024 Scimago Institution Ranking, specifically in the Research Category, USU achieved an impressive 4th national ranking and a global ranking of 1321. The decline in ranking from the previous year served as the impetus for organizing this guidance session led by the USU rector.

 

According to the Rector, this activity serves as a refresher and serves as a reminder for young lecturers about the Tri Dharma of Higher Education, which encompasses its own set of standards. Lecturers are expected to strike a balance between their primary responsibilities, which include innovative teaching, conducting research, and publishing, as these factors can significantly impact university rankings.

 

The Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., emphasized the importance of policy changes that demand Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to fulfill their responsibilities in a well-balanced manner. The governance of HEIs in Indonesia differs from that of other countries in terms of managing lecturer resources. Indonesia is also expected to continue making improvements that will positively affect the overall quality of education.

 

"This guidance activity will be conducted across all faculties and study programs at USU, with the aim of fostering the development of high-quality human resources within the institution," stated the USU rector.

 

During the guidance session, expressions of gratitude were conveyed by Sony Eka Nugraha, S.Farm., M.Si., Apt, and Umaya Ramadhani Putri Nst S.T.I., M.Kom., who are lecturers from USU and attended the event. They expressed their appreciation for the valuable inputs provided by the Rector, particularly regarding Key Performance Indicators, which are of great significance to young lecturers. They expressed their hope that USU can collaborate effectively to achieve the goals of enhancing the Tri Dharma of Higher Education, which will ultimately have a positive impact on USU's international ranking.

 

"Looking ahead, we anticipate further developments in USU's human resources, such as advanced schooling assistance, which will contribute to the continuous enhancement of the quality of lecturers at USU," added Sony.
