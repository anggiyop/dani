“The National Mental Revolution Movement at USU for training and seminar activities has been completed and was attended by 15 faculties. Participants who were originally targeted at 750 students in this activity turned out to be enthusiastically received, where participants for the first and second stages were attended by 1,577 students," the USU Rector said.

USU PR – Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., appreciated the activities of the National Mental Revolution Movement Program in the Clean Indonesia Movement which was carried out by the implementing team by presenting 1,577 USU students virtually.

According to Mury, this activity can provide students and the public with an understanding of the importance of environmental and university hygiene.

“The Clean Indonesia Movement is a movement to realize clean and healthy living behaviors, both physically and spiritually at all nodes of change," he said Sunday (9/26).

Chief Executive Ikhsan Siregar ST, M.Eng said that the program aims to develop students' knowledge and awareness of environmental sustainability and good waste management with Waste Bank management.

In Addition, Ikhsan added that the activity included a test which was carried out twice, namely before and after the training, this was to measure the level of understanding before and after the material presented related to the mental revolution movement and waste management.

“Through this movement, it is hoped that USU students will become agents of change who can provide change and improvement in the community. Students are expected to become agents of change who convey the importance of minimal waste management in their homes and families," he explained.

Ikhsan explained that the National Mental Revolution Movement was an activity initiated by the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Culture together with universities in Indonesia. Where, USU managed to get the trust of the ministry to run this program.

“The National Movement for Mental Revolution Program at USU was carried out in 2 stages of training activities and webinars which were completed on Saturday, September 25, 2021, and 1 more stage is being carried out, namely the Big Idea Competition, where this competition is intended for students to design posters regarding waste management," he explained.(©ULC)
