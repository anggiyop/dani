“Ethics is a protection mechanism for research subjects or researchers. So do not let there be ethical violations due to ignorance,” said Prof. Poppy.

Public Relations USU—The Health Ethics Committee of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Health Research Ethics and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training at Raz Hotel & Convention on Wednesday (19/02/2025). Several researchers from various universities and hospitals attended the training.

 

Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international scientific quality standard implemented by researchers in clinical trial analysis and reporting. It ensures that clinical trials are trusted and guaranteed confidentiality.

 

Prof. Dr. APT, Poppy Anjelisa Z Hasibuan, M.Si., as Vice Rector III, said that USU has a great responsibility to encourage researchers to be innovative and ethical. Every research ensures the rights of every patient. Researchers must improve their capabilities and abilities, especially in the health sector related to ethics.

 

“Ethics is a protection mechanism for research subjects or researchers. So do not let there be ethical violations due to ignorance,” said Prof. Poppy.

 

The Chairman of the Ethics Committee; Prof. Dr. dr. Julianda Harapan, M.A., FISPH, FISCM, Sp. KKLP, in his remarks said that this was the first session in 2025 and was attended by 55 participants from various researchers and academics. He hopes that this research event will be conducted four times this year and not only in the health sector but other disciplines.

 

“The scope is not only in health but has almost expanded even from other departments and faculties,” he said.

 

Prof. dr. Sutomo Kasiman, Sp.PD., Sp. Jp (K), as the resource person who presented the material on the Ethical Principles of Health Research and the Role of the Research Ethics Commission, explained that when researchers conduct research, the first thing to do is the code of ethics. In this case, he also helps researchers to review the research that has been done. “Our role is to review and assist existing researchers either at USU or from other institutions,” he explained.

 

On the same occasion, Prof. Dr. Rosnidar Sembiring, SH, M.Hum., as a resource person presenting Legal and Ethical Aspects in Research, said that every code of ethics carried out is related to applicable legal aspects. Realizing the need for a code of ethics is important in research in the health and non-health sectors. “Indeed, the need for ethical clearance for publication continues to grow not only from the health sector but also from the non-health sector,” he said.
