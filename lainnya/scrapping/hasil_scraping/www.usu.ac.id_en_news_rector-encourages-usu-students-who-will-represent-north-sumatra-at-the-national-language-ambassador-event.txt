“Remember, self-motivation is very crucial. It has to do with mentality. If we are mentally strong, then at least 70 percent of us are ready. We only have 30 percent left to prepare substantive things,” Muryanto said.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., received an audience for the 2021 North Sumatran Main Language Ambassador Ananda Rizqullah and the Head of the North Sumatra Language Center, Dr Maryanto, M Hum, and his entourage, Tuesday (10/12/2021) in the USU Rector's Meeting Room, USU Campus.

On that occasion, the Rector of USU gave an advice to Ananda Rizqullah to keep his spirits up. He advised that self-motivation is crucial to be able to push yourself to give your best.

“Remember, self-motivation is very crucial. It has to do with mentality. If we are mentally strong, then at least 70 percent of us are ready. We only have 30 percent left to prepare substantive things,” Muryanto said.

Ananda himself needs support from all parties to be able to present the best for the campus and the region.

He himself is a student of USU's 2020 Architectural Engineering Department.

"I expect full support from all parties. I hope that the name of the USU campus, and also the North Sumatra area, can be made proud. Although maybe I haven't done face-to-face learning here, being able to make USU proud means a lot to me,” said Ananda.

As is known, Ananda Rizqullah was elected as the North Sumatran Main Language Ambassador in 2021 to represent North Sumatra in the selection of the National Main Language Ambassador. The activity itself will be held on October 14-19 2021 in Jakarta.

The head of the North Sumatra Language Center, Dr. Maryanto said that their arrival was a form of asking for advice and moral support for Ananda who would soon depart to represent North Sumatra.

According to him, this moment is very important to bring back the fading reputation of the language.

"We ask for direction and support from the USU Rector for Ananda Rizqullah. The pressure he carries is huge where we know that North Sumatra itself is the origin of Sanusi Pane who contributed greatly to the formation of the Indonesian language," he said.

Meanwhile, USU's Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, who accompanied the USU Rector, will bridge the North Sumatra Language Center with the USU Language Center.

Communication between the two institutions is important to improve students' ability in Indonesian.

"I will try to communicate later so that the North Sumatra Language Center and the USU Language Center can work together to develop methods to improve students' Indonesian language skills. We know that there are still many students who do not have the ability to speak Indonesian, " Edy said.

In addition, the meeting also discussed the plan to propose the figure of Sanusi Pane who is a national writer and the driving force behind the birth of the Indonesian Unity Language to obtain the title of National Hero. Also discussed was the plan for North Sumatra to host the Indonesian Language Congress in 2023. This congress is held regularly every five years. (©ULC)
