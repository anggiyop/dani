Therefore, in the project that he will carry out, Nixon LP Napitupulu plans to assist USU in formulating a business plan for the development of businesses at USU.

"Therefore, I happen to have a project and maybe one of the projects will help USU to place a business plan and develop businesses at Universitas Sumatera Utara," said Nixon.

Finally, the Director of Bank BTN hopes that this cooperation process will continue in the long term. Currently, the main focus of allocating CSR funds is in the field of education, because education is very important for the progress of the country.
