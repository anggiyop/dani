"The Cooperation Agreement for the Provision of Mandiri Mitrakarya Facilities (House Ownership Program and KPR Mitraguna) for USU employees can be one of the preferred efforts to assist North Sumatra University employees in meeting their daily needs which can be facilitated by Bank Mandiri," the Rector said.

USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin., S.Sos., M.Si collaborated with PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) TBK. This was stated in the cooperation agreement signed by USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin., S.Sos., M.Sc. in the Lobby of the USU CPA Building, Monday (11/21/2022).

In his speech, the USU Rector explained that the form of this collaboration was in the form of Mandiri Mitarakarya services consisting of Mandiri HOP (House Ownership Program) and Mandiri KPR Mitraguna. These two services certainly aim to make it easier for USU employees to meet their needs with the facilitation of Bank Mandiri.

"The Cooperation Agreement for the Provision of Mandiri Mitrakarya Facilities (House Ownership Program and KPR Mitraguna) for USU employees can be one of the preferred efforts to assist North Sumatra University employees in meeting their daily needs which can be facilitated by Bank Mandiri," the Rector said.

Apart from signing the cooperation agreement, PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk provided an ambulance to Chairuddin P. Lubis Hospital, Universitas Sumatera Utara. In this regard, the Rector of USU expressed his gratitude for the assistance of PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk because of course this assistance will support hospital operations so that the medical team can provide maximum service to the people who use Chairuddin P. Lubis Hospital services.

The Rector hopes that the presence of these facilities can increase the enthusiasm of employees and lecturers at USU and have a positive impact on performance and dedication to USU.

On the same occasion, Regional CEO of PT Bank Mandiri REG I Lourentius Aris Budiyanto said the collaboration with USU would bring many conveniences related to providing housing ownership for USU employees. Before working together in the Mandiri Mitrakarya service, USU and PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk itself has been involved in collaboration, one of which is an internship program intended for USU students.

"We give priority to those who excel in the internship, we recruit them to become employees of Bank Mandiri, of course through the existing selection," Lourentius said.

Responding to the provision of an ambulance to Chairuddin P Lubis Hospital, Lourentius Aris Budiyanto said that this was a form of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) which in this case was carried out by PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk to help serve the community by providing facilities to Chairuddin P Lubis Hospital.

"So CSR is a form of Bank Mandiri's concern about how, through our social responsibility, we are helping the USU hospital to serve the existing community. Thus Bank Mandiri participates in supporting service activities to the community," he explained. (©ULC)
