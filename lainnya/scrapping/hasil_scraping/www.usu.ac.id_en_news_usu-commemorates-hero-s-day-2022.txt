"The commemoration of Hero's Day 2022 is expected to continue to provide additional energy to raise awareness of all elements of the nation to continue to unite and help others regardless of barriers. Let's not want to be divided, remember the Seloka Bhinneka Tunggal Ika," said the minister who was read by WR I.

In the mandate, the minister also appealed to the public to be prepared to fight against threats and challenges such as global warming that triggers various natural disasters, food, energy and clean water scarcity.

“Let us move together and move forward together with the determination to win. Once independent, always independent," he added.

In line with that, Dr. Edy Ikhsan said that November 10 Hero's Day was a momentum to continue to build the spirit of heroism and nationalism.

WR I explained that the younger generation has contemporary challenges related to solidarity, nationalism, and diversity.

According to him, the commemoration of Hero's Day should be used as a momentum to foster a sense of nationalism and ground the motto of Bhineka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity).

"We must continue to rekindle that heroic spirit and take the essence and lessons learned from how those who at that time did not have enough weapons, but with extraordinary enthusiasm sacrificed themselves, their families, for an independent Indonesia," he said. (©ULC)
