“The university is committed to being a strategic partner in producing experts and practical solutions to face sustainability challenges,” said Prof. Fidel.

USU PR - The Master Program in Property Management and Valuation (MMPP) of the Postgraduate School of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a national webinar with the theme “Green Building Property Management and Valuation”. This event took place online through the Zoom Meeting platform, on Saturday (11/16/2024).

 

This webinar presented audiences from the Appraisal Professional Association, Provincial, and Regency / City Government Agencies, Directorate General of State Assets (DJKN) Ministry of Finance, Internal Appraisers, Government Appraisers and Public Appraisers, Green Building Council Indonesia, as well as lecturers, students, and alumni from the MMPP Study Program.

 

Through his remarks, USU Secretary, Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked (OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp. F.E.R, expressed his appreciation for this initiative. The USU Secretary highlighted the importance of collaboration between educational institutions, the government, and the private sector to promote the implementation of Green Building in Indonesia.

 

“The University is committed to being a strategic partner in producing experts and practical solutions to face sustainability challenges,” said Prof. Fidel.

 

Prof. Dr. Elisabet Siahaan, SE, M.Ec. as Head of the USU MMPP Study Program, emphasized that Green Building is a strategic solution in facing global challenges such as climate change, energy crisis, and pollution. According to him, the property sector has an important role in supporting the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a reference for global development.

 

“Green Building is not just a trend, but a strategic step to reduce environmental impacts while providing long-term benefits to society,” said Prof. Elisabeth.

 

Meanwhile, Ir. Budi Prasodjo, M.Ec.Dev., MAPPI (Cert.) as Chairman of the National Leadership Council of the Indonesian Professional Appraisal Society (MAPPI), expressed his views on the importance of Green Building certification in Indonesia. To date, only around 60 buildings in Indonesia have Green Building certification, mostly located in Jakarta.

 

“This number is still small compared to thousands of other buildings. However, with a larger investment, Green Building can provide significant operational efficiency in the future,” he emphasized.

 

The webinar was presented by resource person Windu Terkelin Ginting, S.T., M.MPP, an alumnus of MMPP USU, who discussed in depth the concept and assessment of Green Building to provide a healthy and comfortable living space. In his presentation, he highlighted important elements such as energy efficiency, water conservation, and carbon emission reduction.

 

“Green Building is a holistic approach that is not only environmentally friendly but also provides a healthy and comfortable living space,” he explained.
