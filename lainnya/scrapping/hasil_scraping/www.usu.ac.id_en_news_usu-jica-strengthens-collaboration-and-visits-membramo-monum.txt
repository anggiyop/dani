Based on the information from the Chancellor of USU, apart from the purpose of visiting the graves of two JICA staff, there were discussions about several programs that JICA and USU could carry out, especially to help with universities in Japan.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si received a visit from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in the Hearing Room of the Chancellor of the USU Central Administration Building on Monday, (09/26/2022). JICA is an institution that bridges Japan's international cooperation to support the social and economic flows of developing countries.

The Head of Representative of JICA's Indonesia Office, Yasui Takehiro explained that JICA has supported several big projects in Indonesia such as MRT and Sumatra Airline as well as projects with universities.

“JICA is a company that helps the social and economic flow of the country. We also have projects with universities including USU,” explained Yasui.

Yasui Takehiro said that JICA's main visit was to visit the Membramo Monument to visit the graves of two JICA staff who were victims of the 1997 Garuda Indonesia plane tragedy.

"Today we visited to pray and make pilgrimages for 2 JICA staff who died in a plane crash in 1997," he said.

Based on the information from the Chancellor of USU, apart from the purpose of visiting the graves of two JICA staff, there were discussions about several programs that JICA and USU could carry out, especially to help with universities in Japan.

"Programs that can be carried out by JICA with USU and support for connectivity to universities in Japan," the Rector added.

After this visit, there will be a detailed discussion about the ideas that were initiated regarding the collaboration between USU and universities in Japan which will be facilitated by JICA. Therefore, the Rector hopes that these activities can be realized soon.

Visit Membramo Monument

After holding an audience at the Bureau Building, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., accompanied by WR III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation with Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Sc., Apt together with the Head of JICA Representative Yasui Takehiro visited Membramo Polonia.

The visit to Membramo Polonia was aimed at praying for 2 JICA experts who were victims of the Garuda Indonesia flight GA 152 crash in Sibolangit 25 years ago.

Yasui Takehiro said that the visit was not only to pray for the victims but also to commemorate the services of the 2 JICA experts. The last time the pilgrimage was carried out was in 2017.

“25 years ago, because of the Garuda crash, as a JICA expert, there were two people on the plane who became victims. A visit to remember his services," Yasui said.

USU's Person in Charge (PIC) with JICA Prof. Dr. Ir. Bustami Syam MSME remembers one of the victims, Prof. Otake is very instrumental in helping the research culture by providing many projects throughout Indonesia with the facilitation of JICA, so that it becomes USU's capital to become one of the best universities.

“Prof Otake is an expert, so there are two very monumental things that they help us with, namely research culture. He gave many projects throughout Indonesia and both were assisted with equipment by JICA. With this equipment, USU will be able to become what it is today. So I can feel the benefits of JICA,” explained Prof. Bustami while remembering the victim.

WR III for Research, Community Service and Cooperation Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., Apt hopes that JICA's cooperation with USU can continue.
