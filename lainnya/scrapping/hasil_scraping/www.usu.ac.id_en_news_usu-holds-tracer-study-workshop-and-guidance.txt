"I am optimistic that in 2024, we will also be able to repeat last year's achievement by exceeding the set target," said Dr. Edy.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Tracer Study Workshop and Guidance on Thursday (02/22/2024) at the Diamond Ballroom, Cambridge Hotel, to complete the Tracer Study and achieve the target of achieving Main Performance Indicator (IKU) 1.

This activity brought Rizki Amalia, S.H., M.H., the Head of the Alumni Section of Universitas Airlangga, as a guest speaker presenting material related to the Strategy for Achieving Respondent Rate and Golden Standard Tracer Study. This was followed by material on the Ministry's Latest Rules Regarding the Tractor Study, the Tractor Study Report Card Per Faculty, and Tractor Study Technical Guidance.

USU is aiming for an 80% completion rate in its 2024 Tracer Study, and Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, is optimistic about repeating USU's 2023 achievement. The university exceeded the 80% target last year, reaching a 94% completion rate, up from 67% in 2022

"I am optimistic that in 2024, we will also be able to repeat last year's achievement by exceeding the set target," said Dr. Edy.

The Vice Rector I also highlighted that the assessment of the quality of educational services provided by USU is closely related to the Tracer Study target to be achieved. USU is committed to producing superior graduates who can develop science and technology in society, become problem solvers, and be competitive at the national and international levels.

"Universities must be able to create the best formula to produce superior graduates who can survive and become tough survivors," explained Dr. Edy.

Secretary of the USU Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations (DITMAWALUMNI), Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi., M.Psi., explained that achieving the Tracer Study still presents many challenges. Concrete steps must be taken to achieve the Ministry's verification data target.

USU's Manager of Student Welfare, Tracer Study, and Alumni Relations, Ulfi Andayani, S.Kom., M.Kom., explained that the Tracer Study benefits USU's achievements by being an important evaluation tool that ensures the education provided is in accordance with the development needs of society and the world of work.

"Another goal of the Tracer Study is to become a bridge to improve the curriculum to improve the quality of graduates according to the criteria," explained Ulfi.
