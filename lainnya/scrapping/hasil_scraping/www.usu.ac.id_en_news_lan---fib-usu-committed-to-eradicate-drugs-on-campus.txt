According to the Dean of FIB, it is a must for academics to prepare the nation's next generation and improve the quality of student quality so that students excel and stay away from drugs.

USU PR - Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) cooperates with the Anti-Drug Institute of North Sumatra Province (LAN Provsu) to make FIB and USU clean of drugs. This collaboration was manifested in the signing of cooperation between the USU FIB - LAN Provsu and counseling on "The Dangers of Drugs for FIB Students" through a zoom meeting, Tuesday (12/14/2021).

"The LAN will support the USU FIB to jointly eradicate the crime of drug trafficking in FIB and USU," said Dr. Thirhaya.

According to the Dean of FIB, it is a must for academics to prepare the nation's next generation and improve the quality of student quality so that students excel and stay away from drugs.

"It's no secret that Indonesia is in a state of emergency for drugs, a lot of it happens at the productive age. This young generation is the most vulnerable because of the potential for interactions with drug users," she continued.

She added, drugs will easily attack if there is no wise mindset. "If they engage in drug abuse, students can no longer focus on studying," Dr. Thirhaya said. The Dean of FIB hopes that all parties can synergize and are committed to carrying out drug eradication.

Head of LAN Provsu Apt. Razoki Lubis S.Si., M.Kes., M.Biomed explained that LAN is an anti-drug activist organization tasked with providing counseling and prevention. Razoki said that students will also be able to do urine tests at LAN.

"If the FIB wants to provide a urine test, LAN is competent and legal to do a urine test, whether the individual has been exposed to drugs or not," he said.

He hopes that, not only with FIB, in the future other faculties can also cooperate in eradicating drugs with LAN to create a drug-free USU.

"Hopefully we can do this event to other faculties later, so that later North Sumatra and USU are clean of drugs and we can also reach outstanding students as soon as possible," he said.

The event was also attended by Deputy Dean I Prof. Mauly Purba, Deputy Dean II Heristina Dewi, M.Pd. and Deputy Dean III Mhd. Pujiono, Ph.D. with Dr. Zulfan Lubis as the moderator. (©ULC)
