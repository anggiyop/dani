Professor of FH USU Prof. Dr. Ningrum Natasya Sirait, SH, MLi said that the issue of the digital economy is an exciting topic to discuss because it is a problem faced by every country, not only Indonesia.

USU PR - Faculty of Law (FH) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a webinar entitled 'Increasing Knowledge About Legal Protection in the Digital World for E-Commerce Users in Medan'. Inviting resource persons from Kyushu University Japan, the event took place at the Law Postgraduate Building and was broadcast via Zoom Meeting on Friday, (17/06/2022).

Professor of FH USU Prof. Dr. Ningrum Natasya Sirait, SH, MLi said that the issue of the digital economy is an exciting topic to discuss because it is a problem faced by every country, not only Indonesia.

"The issue of the digital economy is not only fussed over by us, the whole world and all countries are discussing it. So I'm delighted that Professor Steven's material shows that Japan itself doesn't have the same problem, but how to respond to it differently, right?” said Prof. Ningrum.

Responding to the sustainability of the E-Commerce system in North Sumatra, Prof. Ningrum said that he was interested in the modes of the Cash on Delivery system problem. The problem of goods sold that did not match the description and the number of counterfeit goods circulating quickly in the market.

“It's a universal question, which everyone has, but I'm more interested in the modes when things go wrong. CoD has a problem, then if the product is not the problem. Yes, of course, this is something funny, yes, in Japan, the branded, recorded, and others. Where we are open, even though there is a disclaimer, we are not allowed to sell fake goods," he said.

He also added that the Indonesian people are more advanced in terms of business compared to the law that regulates business matters. Therefore, he hopes Indonesia will immediately issue a Personal Data Law to respond clearly to all legal rules.

"Maybe we don't feel it directly. But the DPR is currently drafting the Personal Data Constitution on how Indonesia can quickly respond to clear legal rules," he said.

Finally, he hopes that in the future, Kyushu University can sign an MoU with USU to work together, especially with the Faculty of Law, because this can support the Main Performance Index, namely the existence of cooperative relationships with overseas scenes.
