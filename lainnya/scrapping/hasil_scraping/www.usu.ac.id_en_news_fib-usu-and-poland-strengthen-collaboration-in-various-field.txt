"I hope this seminar serves as a productive platform for knowledge and ideas exchange and inspires further collaborations," she said.

USU PR — The Undergraduate Program in History of the Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an Offline and Online Seminar in collaboration with the Embassy of Poland. The seminar focused on "The Relationship Between Poland and Medan - North Sumatra in the 19th and Early 20th Century" on Thursday (Apr. 25, 2024).

 

The seminar discussed the past historical relationship between North Sumatra Province and Poland. Despite their differences, it reflected the interactions between the two countries through various channels such as trade, education, culture, and politics. Research and discussions on this topic aimed not only to understand the historical aspects but also to deepen our understanding of global interactions.

 

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation at USU, stated that this discussion provides an opportunity for exchanging ideas and thoughts between the two countries.

 

"I hope this seminar serves as a productive platform for knowledge and ideas exchange and inspires further collaborations," she said.

 

Furthermore, Prof. Dr. Dra. T. Thyrhaya Zein, M.A., Dean of FIB, mentioned that the cooperation between North Sumatra Province and Poland has been longstanding and further strengthened by rebuilding the existing connections through collaboration.

 

"So, from this history, we want to rebuild and establish connections with the Polish government," she said.

 

The Dean of FIB added that this seminar enhances cooperation and will lead to developing programs supporting internationalization.

 

"So, this starting point has been implemented, and later, we will design many programs that support the University of Sumatera Utara," she added.
