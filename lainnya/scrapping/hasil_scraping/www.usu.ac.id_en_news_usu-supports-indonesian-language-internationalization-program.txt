"Later on, USU foreign students and foreign workers in North Sumatra will study Indonesian at USU, there will be various learning programs and cultural programs prepared," said the Head of USU KUI, Dr. Esther Nababan, M.Sc.

USU PR - The Head of the International Affairs Office (KUI) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received an audience with the North Sumatra Province Language Center with the Language Center Representative, the Head of the Cooperation Bureau, and the Head of the USU Academic Bureau to support the internationalization of the Indonesian language. The hearing was held at the USU KUI Secretariat on Thursday (3/24/2022).

This hearing discussed the design of the BIPA program for USU's foreign students and foreign workers in North Sumatra. The USU Academic Bureau and Language Center which will be the organizers of this program have prepared facilities and various needs.

"Later on, USU foreign students and foreign workers in North Sumatra will study Indonesian at USU, there will be various learning programs and cultural programs prepared," said the Head of USU KUI, Dr. Esther Nababan, M.Sc.

According to Dr. Esther Nababan's BIPA program also supports USU's internationalization achievements because it can attract interest and increase the number of international students at USU, both degree and non-degree programs.

"It is hoped that this program can attract foreign students, it doesn't have to be a degree program, but they can learn Indonesian and know the local culture," he said.

Head of North Sumatra Province Language Center, Dr. Maryanto, M.Hum said that the Kampus Siaga BIPA (BIPA Alert Campus) program was in line with the ministry's mission to advance regional languages ​​and literature, especially North Sumatra, not only at the national level, but also at the international level.

"For this reason, Indonesian will be internationalized through Kampus Siaga BIPA. Campuses are ready to hold various BIPA programs. We also work together on how to make this higher education institution a world-class university,” said Dr. Maryanto.

Kampus Siaga BIPA Program will be held through various activities, such as classroom learning, to learning outside the classroom such as holding a cultural festival or language competition. According to Dr. Maryanto, USU has the potential to develop this program, and is expected to be a trigger for other universities in North Sumatra.

"After this hearing, data collection and program mapping will be carried out, we will immediately launch this service, the USU Language Center will provide the BIPA program," he said.

On this occasion, the Head of the USU Academic Bureau Muhammad Zulham, SE, M.Si appreciated the BIPA program. Improving the Indonesian language is very important for the younger generation to have an understanding of using the language according to the rules. Likewise with foreign workers, they must understand the true identity of the Indonesian language.

"So far it has been there but it has not become our concern, however, through this meeting USU is committed to working with the Language Center for this," he concluded. (©ULC)
