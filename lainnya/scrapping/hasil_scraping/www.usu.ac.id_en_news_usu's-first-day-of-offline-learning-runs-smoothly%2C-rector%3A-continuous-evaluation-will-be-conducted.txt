"We want this PTM to run well, even though it is limited, so that students can immediately experience studying on campus and some are also online," said the Rector.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. visited the Face to Face Learning (PTM) preparation in several faculties, namely the Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry, and the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The activity was carried out on Monday (07/02/2022), and it was observed that on the first day, PTM was running smoothly.

The Chancellor said this visit was to see the learning process and the implementation of health protocols in the classroom. "Health protocols in the faculty have been implemented as desired," he said.

However, according to him, several things must be further matured, such as the learning process by lecturers. Lecturers and students are expected to adapt to technology in the learning process so that PTM will continue to be evaluated.

"We want this PTM to run well, even though it is limited so that students can immediately experience studying on campus, and some are also online," he said.

Dean of FMIPA Dr. Nursahara Pasaribu, M.Sc., also said that the rector's visit had provided an evaluation of things that must be addressed in the implementation of face-to-face learning, including setting up classes and facilities as the use of cameras and applications.

"This is a motivation for us to continue to improve this PTM soon," he said.

On this occasion, one of the FMIPA students, Natasya Umayyah, admitted that she was very enthusiastic about carrying out face-to-face learning. As a 6th semester student, face-to-face learning will make it easier to do research.

“You can go directly to the laboratory for research so that you can gain more knowledge from practice. However, it must be remembered to adhere to the protocol strictly," said Natasya.
