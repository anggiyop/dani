MEDAN-PUBLIC RELATION: The Mayor of Medan, Muhammad Bobby Afif Nasution, admitted that he needed USU academicians to help him carry out their main work programs. He stated that the role of academicians in providing input on policy directions is critical.

"Many sectors in Medan need to be improved. It is critical for academicians to provide studies and concepts on how policies can be implemented," stated Bobby while welcoming the Chancellor of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si, and the deans at the Mayor's Office, Wednesday (5/19).

The son-in-law of President Jokowi emphasized five strategic and priority programs carried out by the Medan City Government (Pemko Medan).

"I convey a few priorities for the Pemko Medan at this time, namely how to overcome Covid-19, repair damaged roads, overcome flood problems, cleanliness, and the development of the Kesawan area. Therefore, I'm seeking feedback from USU "he stated.

Dr. Mury stated that USU and Pemko Medan had agreed to work collaboratively to solve the problems of the people of Medan.

He stated that the university should not be an ivory tower. Academicians must also be able to respond to challenges to solve a variety of existing problems.

"Because the USU Campus is in Medan, the problems that exist in this city are, of course, our responsibility," he explained.

Dr. Mury hopes that the meeting of academicians and government bureaucrats will result in the development of a sophisticated collaboration scheme. They complement one another, allowing the resulting policies to be even more effective.

"The key to success is collaboration. Collaboration and consolidation program of USU and Pemko Medan such as studies, technical matters, and government policy recommendations will undoubtedly support the program of Pemko Medan," he said.

The Chancellor explained that the first step in the collaboration between USU and the Pemko Medan had been conducted, such as a study on waste management in Medan. "We have begun exploring a number of collaborations, such as environmental-based waste management," he said.

Previously, the Chancellor of USU, Dr. Muryanto Amin, also brought the newly inaugurated deans on Monday (5/16) to meet North Sumatra Governor Edy Rahmayadi, Tuesday (5/17). The series of meetings with regional heads are part of USU's efforts to build synergy with the government so that the role of USU academicians can touch on problems that exist in the community.
