“With more specialists, USU contributes to improving access to quality health, supporting the government's vision to realize a healthy and prosperous Indonesian society,” said WR I USU.

USU PR - The Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara (FK USU), held an event to award Brevets or Signs of Expertise for Internal Medicine Specialists as well as Introducing New Specialist Doctor Education Program (PPDS) and Subspecialist Participants. It took place at Le Polonia Hotel, Sudirman Ballroom, on Saturday (14/12/2024).

The event became a momentum for the inauguration of 10 new specialists and the introduction of 13 new PPDS in the field of internal medicine. Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., as Vice Rector I of USU, congratulated the new specialists and their parents who have supported the long struggle during the education period.

“With more specialists, USU contributes to improving access to quality health, supporting the government's vision to create a healthy and prosperous Indonesian society,” said Dr. Edy.

Vice Rector I also expressed his appreciation to the lecturers and mentors who have guided the specialists to this stage. He emphasized that the brevet is not only a symbol of expertise, but also a great mandate in the medical profession.

“Their success is the result of the hard work and dedication of the educators who constantly provide knowledge, time, and attention,” he added.

The Dean of Faculty of Medicine USU, represented by Dr. Zulham, M.Biomed., Ph.D., gave a message to the new PPDS to maintain the good name of the alma mater and continue to develop their abilities, both as medical personnel and leaders in society.

“We hope that these specialists will not only become health care providers (caregivers), but also decision makers, community leaders, and managers who are able to create a sustainable health ecosystem,” said Dr. Zulham.

In line with that, the Head of the Internal Medicine Study Program of Faculty of Medicine USU, Dr. dr. Taufik Sungkar, M.Ked (PD), Sp.PD KGEL, FINASIM, emphasized the importance of Faculty of Medicine USU's role in producing excellent specialists in the field of tropical and infectious diseases. One way to achieve this is through cooperation with overseas institutions such as Taiwan and Korea to send students to study and broaden their horizons.

“We have a vision to become a leading study program in the management of tropical infectious diseases and malignancies, both at the national and international levels,” he said.

Director of RSUP Haji Adam Malik, dr. Zainal Safri, Sp.PD KKV, Sp.JP(K), added that the presence of specialist doctors is very important in supporting equitable distribution of health services in remote areas. He encouraged the graduates to return to their home regions to help fulfill the need for evenly distributed medical personnel throughout Indonesia.

“We also support further development through fellowships at RSUP Haji Adam Malik, so that doctors can continue to improve their competence in deeper specialties,” said Dr. Zainal.
