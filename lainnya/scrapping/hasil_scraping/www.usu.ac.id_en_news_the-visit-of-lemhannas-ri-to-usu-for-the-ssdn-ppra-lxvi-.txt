"USU supports strategic efforts through education and research. We hope to provide an overview of the programs and initiatives we have developed. We are open and very interested in hearing views and presentations," said Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from the Domestic Strategic Studies (SSDN) Program of the National Resilience Institute (LEMHANNAS RI) on Tuesday (May 14, 2024) at the Senate Hall of GBPA USU.

Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., Vice Rector I of USU, welcomed the LEMHANNAS RI team and the 25 Domestic Strategic Studies (SSDN) Program participants. 

SSDN is one of the main activities for participants of the LEMHANNAS RI education program, serving as field practice with a focus on enhancing analysis of regional issues. It is conducted in rotation every year in all provinces of Indonesia. The SSDN PPRA LXVI for the year 2024 is being held in four provinces, including North Sumatra.

In his speech, the USU Rector, represented by Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., expressed that USU always supports education and research. This visit is expected to provide a broad overview of various programs and initiatives developed at USU and serve as a platform for discussion.

"USU supports strategic efforts through education and research. We hope to provide an overview of the programs and initiatives we have developed. We are open and very interested in hearing views and presentations," said Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A.

The Head of the LEMHANNAS RI delegation, Irjen. Pol. Drs. Djoko Poerbohadijojo, M.Si., stated in his speech that this activity, accompanied by LEMHANNAS RI officials, is expected to enhance the leadership qualities of the participants by visiting institutions and strategic objects in the region as part of the SSDN program.

"It is expected to enhance experience, sensitivity, and a high level of concern so that when leading, the quality of leadership can be improved to achieve the posture of a competent and professional leader," said Irjen. Pol. Drs. Djoko Poerbohadijojo, M.Si.

As the speaker, Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., M.S.P., the Dean of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) at USU, mentioned that USU enhances national resilience through the implementation of the three pillars of higher education, including character education, research and studies, community service, and collaboration with partners both domestically and internationally.

"USU enhances national resilience by implementing the three pillars of higher education. Character education, research that produces useful policy briefs, continuous community service, and collaboration with domestic and international partners," said Dr. Hatta Ridho, S.Sos., M.S.P.

Colonel Arhanud Blasius Popylus S.I.P., a participant of the SSDN PPRA LXVI from the Indonesian Army (TNI-AD), expressed that this activity implements the theories learned. The visit to USU provides an academic perspective that can be compared with government practices. USU, with its three pillars, needs to be empowered for the benefit of national development.

"We need to see the implementation in the field firsthand. The visit to USU allows us to see a different perspective from an academic standpoint and then compare it with what practitioners do. USU, with its three pillars, needs to be optimally empowered for the benefit of national development," said Colonel Arhanud Blasius Popylus S.I.P.
