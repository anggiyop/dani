"One of them is the issue of import-export customs, this challenge that needs to be worked together so that we can both give and receive benefits," said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) cooperates with the National Single Window Institute (LNSW) in an effort to restore the national economy as well as the implementation of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education and the Independent Learning Program for the Independent Campus. This collaboration was confirmed in the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MoU) by USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., and Head of LNSW Mochammad Agus Rofiudin, S. Kom., M.M at the Office of the Rector of USU, Thursday (1/20/2022).

The Rector of USU said, in implementing the national economic recovery, LNSW certainly has various challenges that require cooperation with universities.

"One of them is the issue of import-export customs, this challenge that needs to be cooperated so that we can both give and receive benefits," he said.

The Rector added that USU and LNSW can do internships, joint research and independent studies. Students will do internships to learn what kind of work is done by LNSW in order to provide certainty to the public digitally.

"Students, for example, can learn how to collect customs and excise data so that they no longer require lengthy bureaucracies, transparency that can be accessed by the public, and the quality of services that is increasingly providing certainty," he continued.

In addition, according to the Rector, joint seminars can also be held to socialize what the government's digital services framework is like as a based practice to lecturers and students.

"After the signing, we will talk about more technical things. In the first stage, we called the deans of FEB (Faculty of Cultural Sciences), FASILKOM (Faculty of Computer Science), FISIP (Faculty of Social Science and Political Science) and FH (Faculty of Law) to be able to follow up on technical matters," he said.

On the same occasion, the Head of LNSW said, the pandemic had a tremendous impact on global trade. Therefore, the government does not want to be complacent and will take advantage of the pandemic conditions to make a leap by encouraging universities to participate.

"This is surely is not an easy job. It requires synergy from the ministries, institutions and the academic community, because the future of Indonesia lies in the younger generation on campus," Agus said.

According to Agus, his party has seen tremendous potential at USU. Apart from being strategically located and close to the Malacca Strait, USU also has superior human resources (HR). USU's human resources in the North Sumatra region are expected to be active in helping the government boost economic performance.

"Not only from the technical side, this institution will also guide students in terms of soft skills so that in the future this synergy will have an impact on the progress of Indonesia's economic performance," he hoped. (ULC)
