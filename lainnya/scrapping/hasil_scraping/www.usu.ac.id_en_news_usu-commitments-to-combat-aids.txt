"Currently, there are more and more social problems, especially those faced by students. Drugs and AIDS are a scourge that we all face together. We hope that our students will avoid this," he said.

MEDAN-PR USU: As a leading state university, the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) is committed to efforts to eradicate AIDS. This was conveyed directly by the Rector of USU Dr Muryanto Amin, S Sos, M Si, when receiving a visit from the AIDS Eradication Commission (KPA) of North Sumatra Province, Tuesday (15/2/2022) at the Rector's Office.

The Rector of USU said that the development of the times made the development of community diseases more diverse. However, he emphasized that the general ills of society still revolve around drug abuse and the spread of AIDS.

"Currently, there are more and more social problems, especially those faced by students. Drugs and AIDS are a scourge that we all face together. We hope that our students will avoid this," he said.

He added that one of USU's commitments was revitalizing the AIDS prevention agency at USU. He hopes that this institution can contribute more and be effective.

"At USU we have a name called SAHIVA. However, at this time, we are revitalizing this institution so that it focuses not only on AIDS but also on preventing free sex and drugs. So we hope that this institution can contribute to students," he added.

According to him, a new recipe is needed to socialize AIDS prevention. Moreover, the development of increasingly massive information technology must be maximized.

"The current generation is different. They tend not to listen to lectures. Instead, they are more interested in visual socialization such as infographics or videos. I hope KPA can implement this in future socialization," he said.

Muryanto Amin encouraged KPA to cooperate with USU in several ways. This collaboration is expected to increase the effectiveness in AIDS prevention, particularly in North Sumatra.

"I think at least we can work together in this outreach to students and the community. As a higher education institution, we can also use community service as a forum for socialization. In addition, we are ready to encourage the revitalization of socialization content," he explained.

The head of KPA Ikrimah hopes that this cooperation can run quickly. He said that KPA could not run alone in carrying out AIDS prevention efforts.

"KPA cannot run alone because of limitations. We are more of a bridge than inter-institutional efforts to prevent AIDS. One of them is USU, we hope to collaborate for wider dissemination of this message," said Ikrimah.

He added that USU consisted of students with various backgrounds. This potential is considered appropriate for wider socialization, especially when these students return to their hometowns.

In addition to the KPA Team, the Vice-Rector III of USU was also present at the meeting, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Sc., Apt, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Prof.Dr.dr. Aldy Syafruddin Rambe, Sp.S(K), Prof.Drs. Heru Santosa MS., Ph.D, Dr. Lita Sri Andayani SKM., M.Kes., and expert staff in the field of collaboration, drg. Siti Salmiah Sp.KGA. (RR)
