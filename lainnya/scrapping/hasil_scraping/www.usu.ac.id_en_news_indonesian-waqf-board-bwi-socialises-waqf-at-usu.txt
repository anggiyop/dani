The theme of this event is the Socialisation and Contribution of Waqf in National Development, which also aims to support and develop the national movement of 'cash waqf' launched by President Joko Widodo in January 2021, explained Prof. Poppy.

HUMAS USU - Waqf Goes To Campus XIII visited the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) on Tuesday (16/05/2023). The activity, organised by the Indonesian Waqf Board (BWI), took place at the USU Auditorium.

With the theme of Socialisation and Contribution of Waqf in National Development, Waqf Goes to Campus XIII serves as an educational event for millennials about the information on productive waqf and cash waqf programs.

USU's Vice Rector III for Research, Community Service, and Cooperation, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., apt, revealed that this event is in line with the National Movement for Cash Waqf promoted by the president in January 2021.

“The theme of this event is the Socialisation and Contribution of Waqf in National Development, which also aims to support and develop the national movement of 'cash waqf' launched by President Joko Widodo in January 2021,” explained Prof. Poppy.

Through her remarks, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si, M.Si, apt appreciated and hoped this activity could occur continuously.

Vice Rector III revealed that USU welcomes the collaborative synergy offered by the Indonesian Waqf Board with the campus community to strengthen literacy for the campus community and foster awareness and love for waqf.

"This activity is certainly useful to increase literacy in the community, where students act as agents of change to provide a better understanding to the community about waqf," she said.

On this occasion, Prof. Dr. Ir. Mohammad Nuh, DEA, as Chairman of the BWI Executive Board, emphasized the importance of the students having critical thinking with respect. He also said that after learning about waqf, students are expected to have changes in their lives, especially in giving, because life is about giving. If they are accustomed to building a culture of giving, then the social ties in society will be stronger.

“Of course, life is about change. Things can change if critical thinking is present. If there is no critical thinking, then we tend to remain static. But don't forget that giving advice and criticism should not hurt others. The approach is a respectful approach, which is to give respect.”

Furthermore, the Chairman of BWI revealed that universities have great waqf potential. Based on his information from 4 universities, BWI has managed as much as 700 billion waqf.

"It can't be counted because there are so many. Waqf can be in the form of land, with millions of hectares. But there is also cash waqf which, if multiplied, will be tremendous. Currently, only around 700 billion is managed by BWI from four universities, whereas there are thousands of universities," he said.

As information, during the activity, a memorandum of understanding was signed between USU and BWI.
