"Summer courses are not new, we want foreign students to come to USU not only for degree programs, but also for short programs like this," said Dr. Esther.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) implements a Summer Course Program for international students, as a form of campus internationalization. Participants in this program are students from Africa, Malaysia and Thailand.

The series of programs, international students toured the city of Medan to get to know local culture in North Sumatra, especially the city of Medan. Tour activities started from the Saka Hotel Medan, followed by a visit to USU, Maimun Palace, and Tjong A Fie's House, Tuesday (07/12/2021).

Head of USU's Office of International Affairs (KUI), Dr. Esther Sorta Mauli Nababan, M.Sc. said, this Summer Course Program is one of the indicators for USU's internationalization.

"Summer courses are not new, we want foreign students to come to USU not only for degree programs, but also for short programs like this," explained Dr. Esther.

This year's Summer Course program has the theme "Cultural and Traditional Dance". This program is held with a different theme every year.

"The themes are different every year. We have discussed mangroves with Agriculture lecturers, and about tropical diseases with FK lecturers," said Dr. Esther.

He said, this program runs for two to three weeks. "International students also do lectures, they will make presentations and get scores that are equivalent to 2 credits of certain courses from their university," he said.

According to him, the Summer Course program will increase the network of foreign students and USU students.

"The foreign students will become ambassadors for USU, especially regarding the culture of North Sumatra," he continued.

A student from Mali, West Africa, Tata Drama said, he had received a lot of information about Indonesian culture through this program.

“I was able to know more about the culture in this city. I visited Maimun Palace, it's really cool place. At Tjong A Fie's house, I also saw many beautiful rooms. I am proud and happy to participate in this event,” said Tata.

Tata Drama hopes that the next program can present more cultural activities. "Now I know, Indonesia has many cultures," he continued.

One of the students from Thailand Atammisi Waedoyee also conveyed the same thing. He said he was happy and enthusiastic about participating in this program.

"This activity is very good, from Tjong A Fie's house we get a lot of knowledge from the history of him, his wife and children," said Atammisi.
