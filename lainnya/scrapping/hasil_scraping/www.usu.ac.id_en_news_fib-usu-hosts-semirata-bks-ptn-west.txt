"Because this student exchange can mobilize and overcome the gaps that exist in state universities in the Western region,” explained Prof. Mury in his remarks.

USU PR -Faculty of Cultural Sciences (FIB) of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted the 1st ISoLLEAC & 5th ISLCH Semirata 2023 (Annual Meeting Seminar).

The activity, which collaborates with all deans of language, literature, arts, and culture in the Western PTN BKS region, was opened by USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, Friday (25/08/2023) at Hotel Le Polonia Medan.

On this occasion, the USU Rector said that the output of this seminar could produce writings that could be published in Scopus-indexed journals. In addition, the Rector also mentioned the establishment of standardization in the Student Exchange program between BKS PTN Western Region universities.“Because this student exchange is what can mobilize and overcome the gaps that exist in PTN-PTN in the Western region,” said Prof. Mury in his remarks.

Previously, it was known that in this Semirata forum, the deans discussed cooperation related to MBKM as well as collaboration in teaching, research, and community service that could contribute to boosting the university's KPI 1 and KPI 2.

Meanwhile, according to the Dean of FIB USU, Prof. Dr. Tyrhaya Zein, M.A, one of the activities that will be implemented after this Semirata is the exchange of FIB students between Western PTN BKS universities.

“As mentioned earlier, our students can exchange in one semester to study at UNP, then also study at UNJ, and vice versa, especially in FIB because the fields are the same: language, literature, culture, art, and library science. The focus is not only students, of course, collaboration in research, “explained the Dean of FIB USU.

In addition, the output of this international seminar is in the form of scientific publications that will be published in Atlantis Press indexed by Web of Science (WOS).

“So this publication is published in Atlantis Press, indexed by WOS. Thus, increasing citations will also increase future collaborative research,” he added.

The international seminar with the theme “Strengthening Science and Technology Innovations in Language, Literature, Education, Arts, and Culture for Sustainable Development” invited a number of speakers from six countries.
