USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: The University of North Sumatra (USU) continues to make improvements in public services in its environment. Improving public services is one of USU's main focuses as part of bureaucratic reform.

In the Workshop on Public Information Disclosure of Information Management and Documentation Officials (PPID) which was held online on Wednesday (7/14/2021), the Secretary of the University of North Sumatra, Prof. Dr. dr Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M.Ked. (OG), Sp.OG (K), conveying information disclosure is the main key in public services.

“There are various forms of public services, one of which is Information and Documentation Management. PPID is a manifestation of USU's commitment to provide maximum service to the wider community," Prof. Fidel said.

He also said that PPID would show the integrity of an institution. USU as a public institution must open the widest possible opportunities for the public to access information and documentation.

“We have to show USU's integrity as a competent public institution. With the presence of the PPID system, we are trying to gain public trust through information disclosure," he said.

Siti Ajijah, SH., MH., Expert Assistant to the Central Information Commission of the Republic of Indonesia, said that information disclosure in an institution is the responsibility of the head of an institution. The Chancellor and Secretary of USU are the main leaders in PPID.

“Leaders must directly monitor and be responsible for the continuity of information disclosure in an institution. In this case, USU, the Chancellor and the University Secretary are directly the main leaders of PPID," Siti Ajijah said.

In addition, he emphasized that his party through the Monitoring and Evaluation Team would carry out periodic supervision of the institutions that run PPID. Siti Ajijah mentioned that the presence of the Chancellor and Secretary of the University became an assessment in the evaluation concerned.

Prof Fidel responded to this by inviting all parties to contribute in improving PPID at USU. He appealed to work units within USU, especially the USU Public Relations, Promotion and Protocol Work Unit to continue to strive to encourage the sustainability of information disclosure.

"I urge the work units at USU, especially USU's Public Relations, Promotion and Protocol to always be committed to providing information disclosure services. As a leader, I will supervise and guide so that this service can take place effectively,” Prof. Fidel said.

Amalia Meutia, M.Psi., Psychologist, as the Head of Public Relations, Promotion and Protocol at USU and her staff attended the event. The activity itself lasted for two days on July 14-15, 2021. (RR/YH-©ULC)
