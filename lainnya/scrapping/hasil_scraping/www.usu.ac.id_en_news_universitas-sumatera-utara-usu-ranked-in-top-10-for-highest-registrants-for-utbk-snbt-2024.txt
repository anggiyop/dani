MEDAN-USU PR: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has again entered the top 10 state universities with the highest number of registrants for the National Selection Based on Test Scores (SNBT) in 2024. USU ranked 8th below UI, USM, UGM, Undip, UB, Unpad, and Unair.

This year, USU received 3,029 prospective students through the SNBT pathway and 762 Indonesian Smart Card (KIPK) recipients from 61,366 applicants. The university's capacity for the academic year 2024/2025 for SNBT applicants is 3,114 seats.

"We congratulate the students who have successfully passed the UTBK SNBT 2024. This achievement opens the door for you to pursue your desired aspirations. Stay motivated and conquer every challenge you face in your education journey," expressed the Head of Public Relations, Protocol, and Promotion Office of USU, Amalia Meutia, M.Psi, Psychologist, to the media following the announcement on Thursday (Jun. 13, 2024)

Amalia explained that the highest UTBK scores at USU were achieved by the Medicine, Dentistry, and Industrial Engineering programs in the science department. Meanwhile, participants from the Accounting, Communication Science, and Law programs attained the highest scores in the social sciences department.

Furthermore, USU also ranked in the category of strictest program evaluations, with the Pharmacy and Food Analyst Program (D3) ranked 7th with a strictness percentage of 0.69%, and the Tax Administration Program (D3) ranked 20th. USU stood 14th among 20 academic state universities for the highest average UTBK scores. Meanwhile, North Sumatra Province ranked 2nd among provinces with the most KIP scholarship recipients.

USU's Public Relations Office conveyed that for all participants who did not pass the UTBK SNBT 2024, there is no need to feel disheartened or discouraged, as there are still opportunities to enter USU through two other available pathways. These include the Independent Selection Program for State Universities Consortium of Western Indonesia, better known as SMM PTN Barat, and USU's Independent Student Selection Pathway 2024. Both programs provide opportunities for high school graduates to fill the quotas provided by USU.

Registration for the Independent Selection Program for the State Universities Consortium of Western Indonesia has been open from May 4 to June 20, 2024. Information regarding registration procedures and selection execution can be accessed at https://pendaftaran.smmptnbarat.id. Meanwhile, registration for USU's Independent Student Selection Pathway will commence from June 24 to July 14, 2024; details can be found at https://seleksi.usu.ac.id.

"For new prospective students of Universitas Sumatera Utara who have been accepted through the National Selection Based on Test Scores (SNBT) in 2024, it is mandatory to register and complete the Single Tuition Fee (UKT) data online. Basic data entry and document uploads must be done online at https://registrasi.usu.ac.id from June 15 to June 22, 2024. We urge all prospective students to carefully observe every detail of the dates and stages that must be completed. Missing these deadlines may result in the cancellation of your acceptance, and all efforts and hard work so far could be in vain," concluded Amalia.
