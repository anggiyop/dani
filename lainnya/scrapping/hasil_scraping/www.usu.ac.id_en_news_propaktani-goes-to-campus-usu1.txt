USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos M.Si said that this Memorandum of Understanding is very important for USU, especially in the success of the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program and creating a superior generation that is committed to restoring Indonesia's sovereignty as an agricultural country.

PR USU - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) officially cooperates with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia. It was stated in the Memorandum of Understanding signed by both parties.

A public lecture also followed this activity, ProPakTani Goes to Campus, which was packaged under the title "Food Security as the Foundation of Regional Development" at the USU Student Center on Tuesday (31/05/2022).

In his remarks, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos M.Si said that this Memorandum of Understanding is very important for USU, especially in the success of the Merdeka Learning Campus Merdeka (MBKM) program. It creates a superior generation committed to restoring Indonesia's sovereignty as an agricultural country.

"The signing of this Memorandum of Understanding is significant for USU, where it is a form of support from the Government for the USU in the success of the MBKM program," said the Rector.

The Rector hopes that the signing of this memorandum of understanding, it can be an entry point for USU to establish a broader synergy with the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture and create new opportunities to increase the capacity and skills of USU graduates.

According to the Rector, there are several things that universities can do to improve food security in Indonesia, including conducting research and community service, especially to farmers. He also added that food security could only be realized if farming is strengthened and lands can be protected.

"This food security can only be done if farming is strengthened and the land is maintained to continue sustainable agricultural development," he said.

This collaboration can bridge opportunities and opportunities for USU to be able to progress significantly so that it can achieve the targeted campus internationalization goals, this is as stated by the USU Rector.

"We believe that this collaboration is a bridge that will expand USU's opportunities and opportunities to progress significantly and achieve the targeted campus internationalization goals," said the Rector.

For information, the ProPakTani Goes To Campus public lecture at USU is the first time the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia has held outside Java.
