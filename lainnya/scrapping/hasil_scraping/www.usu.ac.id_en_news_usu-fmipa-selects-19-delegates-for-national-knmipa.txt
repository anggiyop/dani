PR USU - The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) of the Unversitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a regional selection for the National Competition for Mathematics and Natural Sciences for Higher Education (KNMIPA-PT) on Thursday (7/28/2022).

At the regional level KNMIPA, USU has 19 delegates with 5 participants in each field.

Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations Doli Muhammad Jafar Dalimunthe SE., M.Sc. said that the participants will be screened so that the 2 participants with the top rank will advance to the national level.

“The USU delegation at that level has 19 students, 5 each from a field that will be screened. Later, to enter the national competition, the top 2 rankings for each category plus the best scores will meet the national quota," he said.

Doli Dalimunthe added that KNMIPA is USU's priority program, especially for the student directorate whose task is to provide assistance in order to achieve optimal results in the national KNMIPA.

"Certainly KNMIPA is a priority program at USU, especially at the student affairs directorate, as this assistance so that we can achieve optimal results at KNMIPA later," added Doli.

Doli Dalimunthe hopes that after such a briefing, the target on the national performance contract, which is to penetrate the top 9 rankings, can be achieved.

"We have a target in our national performance contract to rank in the top 9, I am sure that with what is prepared now, the target can be achieved," said Doli.

On the same occasion, USU's Deputy Dean I FMIPA and Chair of KNMIPA Dr. Cut Fatimah Zuhra, M.Si explained, the KNMIPA selection was divided into 2 sessions, namely the afternoon session for Physics and Mathematics and the morning session for Chemistry and Biology.

Dr. Cut said the participants had undergone a kind of quarantine during the debriefing by setting up two sessions to discuss the questions that would be tested at the regional level KNMIPA under the guidance of expert speakers in each field.
