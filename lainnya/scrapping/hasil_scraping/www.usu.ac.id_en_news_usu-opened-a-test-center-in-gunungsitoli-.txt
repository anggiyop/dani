"This year, the number of study programs offered by USU in the UTBK-SNBT 2024 consists of 49 undergraduate programs (S1), seven diploma programs (D3), and five professional programs (D4). The D4 programs are newly opened in this year's UTBK," said Edy Ikhsan.

USU PR—The Computer-Based Written Test (UTBK) for the National Selection for Higher Education (SNBT) 2024 at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) began on the first day according to the guidelines set by the central committee of the National Selection for New Students (SNPMB) 2024 on Monday (Apr. 3). The UTBK will take place in two waves, with Wave I from April 30 to May 7, 2024, and Wave II from May 14 to May 20, 2024.

The activity is conducted in two sessions per day, with the exam materials consisting of the Scholastic Potential Test (TPS), literacy in Indonesian and English, and mathematical reasoning. The number of UTBK-SNBT 2024 registrants of USU is 37,169 participants, consisting of 36,007 registrants at USU, 857 at the Gunungsitoli Sub Test Center, and 305 at Nias Selatan. The number of participants with disabilities taking the UTBK-SNBT at USU in 2024 is three visually impaired individuals, with their exams scheduled for Session 3 on May 2, 2024.

This was conveyed by Dr. Edy Ikhsan, S.H., M.A., Vice Rector I of USU, in an interview session with several print and electronic media journalists after observing the first day of the UTBK.

"This year, the number of study programs offered by USU in the UTBK-SNBT 2024 consists of 49 undergraduate programs (S1), seven diploma programs (D3), and five professional programs (D4). The D4 programs are newly opened in this year's UTBK," said Edy Ikhsan.

Edy Ikhsan added that this year, the exams are not only held at USU but also at new test centers in Nias, located in two locations: SMA Negeri 1 Gunungsitoli and SMK Negeri 1 Teluk Dalam. The opening of the Nias sub-test centers aims to facilitate UTBK participants in the area so they do not have to travel far to Medan.

The total capacity for UTBK-SNBT at USU in 2024 is 2,801 seats, consisting of 2,405 seats for Undergraduate programs, 214 seats for D3 programs, and 182 seats for D4 programs. The announcement of SNBT results will be held on June 13, 2024, and the period to download SNBT certificates will be from June 17 to July 31, 2024," explained Edy Ikhsan.

Meanwhile, according to Ikhsan Siregar, S.T., M.Eng., the Head of the UTBK-SNBT Implementation at USU, measures have been taken to enhance exam security and anticipate the possibility of cheating in this year's UTBK. He hopes that incidents such as exam impersonation will no longer occur.

Participants this year are only allowed to take the UTBK once, and the results of the UTBK 2024 are only valid for participating in the SNBT and admissions to state universities. The SNBT 2024 selection is based on the results of the UTBK 2024 and portfolios for students choosing art and/or sports programs.

Students who have been declared eligible through the SNBP 2024, SNBP 2023, and National Selection for State Universities (SNMPTN) 2022 are not allowed to register for the SNBT 2024. Students declared eligible through the SNBP 2024 are not eligible to apply for the Independent Selection at any state university. Participants who have been declared eligible through the SNBT 2024 and have completed registration 4at the intended state university will not be accepted in the Independent Selection 2024 at any state university.
