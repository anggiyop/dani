USU Expert Staff for Academic Affairs, Reni Asmara Ariga, S.Kp, MARS said that USU would prepare the MBKM program in the even semester earlier. It aims to maximize every available time for more mature preparation.

USU PR - The University of North Sumatra (USU) has made improvements in preparing the Independent Learning-Independent Campus (MBKM) program which will enter the Even Semester of the 2021/2022 Academic Year. PT Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) and PT Bank Mandiri as partners in a meeting held in the Academic Senate Meeting Room of the USU Central Administration, Tuesday (10/19/2021).

USU Expert Staff for Academic Affairs, Reni Asmara Ariga, S.Kp, MARS said that USU would prepare the MBKM program in the even semester earlier. It aims to maximize every available time for more mature preparation. We have prepared the MBKM program in advance so that the preparation is more mature.

"Of course we know that the MBKM program is only maximized in early 2021, so we want the MBKM program to be able to run optimally in 2022," Reni said.

She also explained that the MBKM program series process has started since the end of 2021. According to her, early preparation also provides an opportunity for students to be able to prepare themselves individually.

"We will start this from October until December, there will be an announcement. There are several stages of preparation that we have to go through to get to the announcement, both internally and together with partners," she added.

The series begins with the determination of partners through an MOU/MOA agreement, partner programs, student requirements, and socialization to study programs. After that, it is continued with the conversion of courses with the study program identifying and announcing the courses that will be recognized, socializing partners to student academic supervisors, then registering courses to SIA.

The series is continued with student registration which will also be socialized through social media, USU and faculty websites, registration links, and activation of academic supervisors or DPL. The next stage is the selection carried out by the Academic Bureau and the Bureau of Research, Community Service, and USU Cooperation with MBKM partners. Until finally it was announced through an official letter from USU Vice Rector I.

PT Bank Mandiri representative Ika Sri Hartini, said that her party supports the MBKM program through two channels, namely in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology, and also in collaboration with USU.

"Specifically in collaboration with USU, we have prepared a program called Bank Mandiri's Special Regional Leadership Candidate (CPDK). This program aims to attract students to become permanent employees of Bank Mandiri. Starting with MBKM internships, craft internships, contract employees, until those who are competent become permanent employees," Ika said.

The same thing was conveyed by a representative of PT BNI Muhammad Bukit who said that PT BNI in principle supports the MBKM program with USU. PT BNI will also adapt to the goals expected by USU through this program.

In addition to Reni, USU's Expert Staff for Cooperation Siti Salmiah drg, Sp KGA, Head of the Research, Community Service, and Cooperation Bureau of USU Surya Darma S Sos, Head of the USU Academic Bureau Muhammad Zulham, SE, M Si, lecturers, and education staff of USU were also present. (©ULC)
