"Hopefully this assistance can be put to good use according to its designation by the USU Hospital medical team in supporting the medical services provided by USU Hospital to its patients," said the Rector.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara Hospital (USU) received assistance in the form of 3 units of Oxygen Concentrator from PT Sari Indofood. This assistance is a form of support for USU Hospital as a referral hospital for Covid-19 patients in North Sumatra Province. The handover was held at USU Hospital, Monday (12/13/2021).

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., expressed his gratitude for the assistance given to the USU Hospital Medical Team and the attention given to PT Sari Incofood Corporation.

"Hopefully this assistance can be put to good use according to its designation by the USU Hospital medical team in supporting the medical services provided by USU Hospital to its patients," he said.

The Rector said that the delivery of Oxygen Concentrator assistance would be continued into cooperation in various other forms, which could provide benefits and support for the progress of both parties.

"USU always opens the door as wide as possible for various parties, including the industrial world to work together and synergize with each other in making USU an educational institution that is trusted by the people of Indonesia and the world," he said.

In developing good services for the provision of education for universities and health services to the community, USU Hospital will continue to collaborate with various parties.

President Director of USU Hospital, Dr. dr. Henry Salim Siregar, MKed(OG), SpOG(K) said that the use of Oxygen Concentrator will be maximized for patients.

"Everything for patients can be used, it produces its own oxygen, it can be used in an emergency," Dr. dr. Henry said.

Dr. dr. Henry added, this Oxygen Concentrator can be used when the number of patients is large and there is a lack of available oxygen. (©ULC)
