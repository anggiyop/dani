About Kendo USU Student Activity Unit

The Kendo Student Activity Unit (UKM Kendo) at USU is a platform for students who have an interest and talent in the martial art of Kendo. This organization was established to develop skills in traditional Japanese sword techniques, enhance self-discipline, and foster a spirit of sportsmanship among students. Regular activities conducted by members include scheduled training, rank promotion exams (grading), and participation in competitions at both national and international levels. The existence of the USU Kendo UKM reflects Universitas Sumatera Utara’s commitment to supporting student achievements while promoting and preserving Japanese culture through the sport of Kendo.
