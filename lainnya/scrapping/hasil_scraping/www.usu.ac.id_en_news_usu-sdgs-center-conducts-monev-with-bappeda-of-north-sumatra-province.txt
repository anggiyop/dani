"In achieving the SDGs we definitely need to document program activities in the Regional Action Plan (RAD). Then in its implementation, we have to measure its achievements," said the Head of the SDGs Center.

USU PR - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Center of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Forum Group Discussion for the Preparation of Monitoring and Evaluation (Monev) of SDGs with the Provincial Regional Development and Planning Agency (Bappeda) and 33 Regencies/Cities Bappeda in North Sumatra. The event was held at the Grandhika Hotel Medan, Monday (12/6/2021).

Head of USU SDGs Center Wahyu Ario Pratomo, S.E, M.Ec said the SDGs were held as an effort to accelerate the achievement of SDGs in Indonesia, especially North Sumatra.

"In achieving the SDGs we definitely need to document program activities in the Regional Action Plan (RAD). Then in its implementation, we have to measure its achievements," said the Head of the SDGs Center.

Wahyu said that through this SDGs activity, regions could understand how far they had reached the targets set in the RAD. Then, the regions can follow up on their achievements.

"Of course this can provide input in the preparation of a higher quality program to achieve the SDGs," he continued.

Wahyu added, through this FGD activity, regions will increase their knowledge and understanding in compiling monitoring and evaluation documents, so that regions can understand and see where their current position is.

“Are the regions already achieving the targets that have been set, or are they still far behind the targets that have been set. If they are left behind, the regions can accelerate, so there is a priority to achieve the targets that have been set," he said.

One of the keynote speaker, Tapi Sari Rumondang Bulan Siregar, S.S, S.E, Ak. conveyed that the monitoring and evaluation of the RAD SDGs in North Sumatra was very important.

"Guidance is being carried out for Bappeda who will carry out a similar arrangement following the instructions from the Indonesian National Development Planning Agency in accordance with the preparation of the 2nd edition of the SDGs RAD," said the representative for SDGs of Bappeda of North Sumatra Province.

Sari hoped that the Regency/City Bappeda can compile a document related to monitoring, evaluating achievements, and realizing the indicators and program activities contained in the Regencies/Cities SDGs document.

"I also hope there will be synchronization and synergy not only between the city and provincial Bappeda, but with all cross-sectors, from community organizations, academics represented by USU's SDGs and various related stakeholders," she said. (©ULC)
