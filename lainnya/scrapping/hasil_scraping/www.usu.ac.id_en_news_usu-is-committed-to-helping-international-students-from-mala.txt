"Students must focus on studying and should not be disturbed just because of problems with visas and residence permits," said the Rector.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., received a visit from the Malaysian Consulate General to discuss international students. The visit took place in the Audience Room of the USU Central Administration Building on Tuesday (4/12/2022).

During the visit, the USU Rector and the Malaysian Consulate General discussed the logistical needs of Malaysian students, namely visas and residence permits.

USU will assist students with administrative problems by setting up a special team to strengthen and reinforce the procedures carried out by the Office of International Affairs regarding visa processing.

"Students must focus on studying and should not be disturbed just because of visa problems and residence permits," he said.

USU will meet all the needs of Malaysian students at USU. USU will also create separate communication media such as WhatsApp Group (WAG) so that problems that occur can be resolved quickly in a family manner.

In line with what the Rector said, Malaysian Consulate General Aiyub Bin Omar said that Malaysia has the most international students at USU. For that, there must be a further meeting to discuss further about visas and residence permits for Malaysian students.

"We are both solving existing problems to make it easier for students," said the Malaysian Consulate General.

The Malaysian Consulate General also hopes that his party will always establish and enhance cooperation with USU. (©ULC)
