Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a technical briefing on the World Class University research program in 2023. This activity occurred on Monday (30/01/2023) in the LP USU Seminar room.

Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, Rector of USU, stated that collaborative research is one of the initiatives that can be improved to assist internationalization. This form of international collaboration with foreign scholars is predicted to be implemented shortly to realize the benefits.

"Regarding international collaborative research, hopefully, this can provide many benefits, especially academic pursuits. In 2023 at the beginning, after we evaluated for two years from 2021-2022 for the strategic plan implementation, we are serious about carrying out the mandate on the map to implement a world-class university or what is referred to as internationalization," said the USU Chancellor.

Director of the USU's Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships, Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., MT, explained that the international research collaboration launched to improve academic reputation certainly affects USU, which will lead to a world-class university.

"So the most important thing to achieve World Class University is actually through research. Well, that's why a research scheme was designed to support, one of which is academic reputation. Through the number of research collaborations with foreign countries, the second is quality," said the Director of the USU Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships.

Head of the USU Research Institute, Prof. Dr. Robert Sibarani MS, also explained that the university had supported research in terms of funding. In contrast, last year, there were 500 titles funded by the university. And it is expected to trigger an increase in university rankings.

"Universitas Sumatera Utara has provided several research funding schemes for 1,550 lecturers. There, Universitas Sumatera Utara funds fund a research scheme program and are also funds obtained from the Ministry. And specifically, for the funds provided by Universitas Sumatera Utara last year, there were 500 titles. This year we hope there will also be like that, "said the Head of the USU Research Institute.
