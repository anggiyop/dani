“In carrying out this Ramadan worship, we need sincerity. Our relationship with humans must also be clean,” he said.

USU PR—The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the work unit directly held a recitation and gathering to welcome the Holy Month of Ramadan 1445 H. This event was held at the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB) on Tuesday (02/27/2024).

This recitation and gathering event is a place to stay in touch with fellow work units at USU and as a form of gratitude for being able to meet again during Ramadan this year. Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., said that this gathering event could strengthen communication, extend life, and increase sustenance. Also, when fasting, we must forgive each other.

“In carrying out this Ramadan worship, we need sincerity. Our relationship with humans must also be clean,” he said.

On this occasion, she also presented a speaker, Dr. HM. Nazrul Fahri Hamyar, who smoothly conveyed tips and messages for fasting. In this case, Dr. Nazrul advised that if the friendship is good, then the performance is also good.

“We have made friends to strengthen our cooperation between institutions and units so that the friendship goes well. God willing, it will produce good results,” he said.

Dr. Nazrul added that this event is also a form of appreciation to each other for the performance that has been done in the past year. It aims to improve relationships not only with God but also between fellow humans.

“Giving appreciation for the cooperation between the units present here,” he added.
