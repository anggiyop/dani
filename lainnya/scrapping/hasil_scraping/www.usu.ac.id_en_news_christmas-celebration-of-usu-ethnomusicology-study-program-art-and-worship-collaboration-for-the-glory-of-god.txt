“We are very grateful to see students able to work and innovate. In the midst of the busy end-of-semester exams, you show your commitment to glorify God,” Hubari said.

USU PR - The Ethnomusicology Study Program of the Faculty of Cultural Sciences, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Christmas Celebration themed “Gift For The Lord” with the subtheme “Let Everything That Breathes Praise the Lord, Hallelujah (Psalm 150:6)”. The event, which combined worship with cultural arts, took place at the USU Student Center on Tuesday (10/12/2024).

 

The Secretary of the Ethnomusicology Study Program, Hubari Gulo, S.Sn., M.Sn., in his speech appreciated the initiative of students who independently organized this event. He also advised students to continue to prioritize academic responsibilities while serving God.

 

“We are very grateful to see students able to work and innovate. In the midst of the busy semester final exams, you show your commitment to glorify God,” Hubari said.

 

Committee Chair, Dede Naibaho, explained that the Christmas celebration was filled with a series of events, including worship and traditional art performances. Performances from groups such as Black Canal Community, Komunal Primitif, Benny Tambak, Kristina Samosir, Roni Sihite, and CBD. He also added that the event was open to the public and was attended by hundreds of people.

 

“Different from the previous year, this year's theme presents a more festive feel with the dominant red color, symbolizing the spirit and joy of Christmas,” said Dede.

 

Chairman of the Ethnomusicology Department Student Association, Johan Sitanggang, revealed that the theme “Gift For The Lord” represents praise, dance, and love offered as a gift to God. He hopes that similar events can continue to be a tradition that strengthens cultural and spiritual values among the academic community.

 

“The true gift to God is the love we manifest through praise and service. Everything we do in this event is for His glory,” said Johan.

 

This Christmas celebration is not only a moment of worship, but also a place to strengthen relationships between students, lecturers, alumni, and the community. Meanwhile, Ethnomusicology alumni, Bakhtiar Sinaga, reminded the participants of the meaning of the birth of Jesus Christ as the greatest gift for mankind.

 

“Every praise and dance that we offer is a form of thanksgiving for His incomparable love,” said Bakhtiar.
