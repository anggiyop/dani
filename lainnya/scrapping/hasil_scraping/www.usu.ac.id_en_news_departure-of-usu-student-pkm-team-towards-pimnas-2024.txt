“I would like to congratulate the students who made it through as finalists for the 37th PIMNAS. This is a proud achievement, and we hope to achieve better results than the previous year,” said Vice Rector I USU.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) officially released a team of students who will compete in the 37th National Student Science Week (PIMNAS). The event was also a preparation for PIMNAS which will take place at Universitas Airlangga from October 14 to 19, 2024. It took place at Pancur Gading Hotel and Resort Deli Serdang, on Saturday-Sunday (21-22/09/2024).

USU Vice Rector I, Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA, in his speech expressed his appreciation and hopes to the students. USU itself has a proud history of achievement at PIMNAS, with last year winning several awards, including the 2nd place winner of the PKM Video Poster for Constructive Ideas and the 2nd place winner of the PKM Poster for Entrepreneurship.

“I would like to congratulate the students who made it through as finalists for the 37th PIMNAS. This is a proud achievement, and we hope to achieve better results than the previous year,” he said.

The Vice Rector I also motivated the participants to make this event an opportunity to learn and network with students from all over Indonesia. He also advised the students to remain humble, compete with sportsmanship, and focus on the process and experience gained.

“Make this moment an opportunity to exchange ideas and foster useful networks,” he said.

The Head of the USU PKM Center, Ir. Erni Misran ST., MT., Ph.D., said that the PKM Center had made a new breakthrough in preparation for this year's PIMNAS by holding a Bootcamp three times. In addition, they also provide assistance for every scientific article and poster made by students.

According to the Head of PKM Center USU, for the preparation of students in the following year, PKM Center has scheduled lecturer training and socialization earlier, which is expected to begin in November after the team returns from PIMNAS in October, so that the acceptance of proposals in 2025 can be announced sooner.

“We scheduled lecturer training (TOT) and socialization earlier. God willing, after the team returns from PIMNAS in October, in November, we will start again so that the acceptance of proposals for 2025 can be announced sooner,” said Ir. Erni.

Meanwhile, the Director of USU's Directorate of Student Achievement and Alumni Relations, Rahma Yurliani, S.Psi, M.Psi, expressed her hope that students would be more confident when performing at PIMNAS. She also emphasized the importance of maintaining stamina given the tight schedule of students, which includes lectures, research, and PIMNAS preparation.

“For next year, the PKM Center will hold socialization earlier so that preparations can be maximized, with the hope that there will be more and better quality proposals,” said Rahma.
