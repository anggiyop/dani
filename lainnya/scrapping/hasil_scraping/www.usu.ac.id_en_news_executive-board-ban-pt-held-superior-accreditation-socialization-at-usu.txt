In the socialization of leading to superior accreditation, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that the USU Internal Team together with BAN-PT will immediately follow up on the points that have been submitted.

PR USU - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Socialization of USU's Strategy Towards Excellent Accreditation by inviting two presenters from the Executive Board Member of the National Accreditation Board for Higher Education (BAN-PT), Prof. H. Johni Najwan, S.H., M. H., Ph.D and Dr. Slamet Wahyudi, S.T., M.T.. The event took place at the USU Auditorium, Thursday (14/07/2022).

In the socialization of leading to superior accreditation, USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si said that the USU Internal Team together with BAN-PT will immediately follow up on the points that have been submitted.

"Earlier we had a lot of enlightenment. We will immediately follow up on the points that have been conveyed,” said the Rector.

In the process of increasing this accreditation, the Rector of USU admitted that the only obstacle at this time was the time timeline that had to be consistent. The USU's strategy this time is to add to the things that already exist and fulfill those that are lacking carefully.

"Observing which ones are not fulfilled, which ones are already added," he said.

Member of the Executive Board of BAN-PT Prof. H. Johni Najwan, S.H., M. H., Ph.D said that the first stage in the standard towards superior accreditation is through UTI or re-accreditation.

According to Prof. Johni, there is already a fundamental problem in preparing excellent accreditation for USU, which requires time acceleration.

"Actually, I think specifically for USU, there are already fundamental problems in preparing for superior accreditation because in my opinion only time acceleration is needed," said Prof. Johnny.

The next speaker, Dr. Slamet Wahyudi, S.T., M.T. convey that USU is in a safe position. This is assessed from the things that affect the assessment related to monitoring in universities.

"When it comes to monitoring the PT, if the PT is not serious about improving the PT, it can experience a decline, but at USU, our calculations will be safe, God willing," said Dr. Slamet. He said that USU Rector and all academia have a target that by end of July they have already uploaded ISK (©ULC)
