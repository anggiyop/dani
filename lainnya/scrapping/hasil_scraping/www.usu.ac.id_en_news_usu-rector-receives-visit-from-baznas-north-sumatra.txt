Later we will try to make a literacy schedule for students and lecturers through recitation, if for example for public lectures it will be less concentrated, but if in the mosque it can be more effective," said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held an audience with Baznas North Sumatra on Tuesday, (15/08/2023) in the Rector's Audience Room.

Baznas North Sumatra visited Universitas Sumatera Utara to coordinate its duties as a zakat manager. Baznas is a non-structural government institution that has a major economic impact in the midst of society. One of them is the empowerment of students through their rights to receive scholarships and other educational assistance.

USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si. welcomed the audience. In his remarks, the USU Rector expressed his hope that Baznas would make zakat literacy through recitations. Later, these recitations will be routinely attended by students and lecturers in their respective faculty mosques.

"Later we will try to make a literacy schedule for students and lecturers through recitation, if for example for public lectures it will be less concentrated, but if in the mosque it can be more effective," said the USU Rector.

Chairman of Baznas North Sumatra Prof. Dr. H. Mohammad Hatta said that the potential for zakat in North Sumatra based on the results of the study of the zakat infaq and sadaqah center reached 8.1 trillion. He also said that if this potential is maximized, it can give great meaning, especially to students in universities.

"We have made various efforts in this regard, including the scholarship which is also related to USU students, some of whom are currently in progress to get it," explained the Chairman of Baznas.
