"I am delighted with this movement to reduce carbon emissions," he said.

USU PR - Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si received an audience from the Forest Area Consolidation Center (BPKH) related to the Indonesia Forestry and Other Land Uses (FOLU) Net Sink activity agenda. It took place in the Rector's Meeting Room of the USU Central Administrative Bureau Building on Thursday (16/16). 06/2022).

The Rector said he fully supports the FOLU Net Sink activity by inviting students to maintain the environment, increase air capacity and reduce carbon emissions. Later there will also be a greening movement from students.

"I am delighted with this movement to reduce carbon emissions," he said.

On the same occasion, Head of the Medan Forest Area Consolidation Center Pernando L Tobing said that this activity came from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry program to promote carbon emission reductions of 60%.

"The socialization of reducing carbon emissions will start from the previous academic field and then to the community," he said.

This socialization will be held on June 23, 2022 at the USU student arena, which all forestry faculties will attend throughout Sumatra with 200 hybrid participants and 1000 online participants.

"This outreach will be attended by students, governments and companies as resource persons," he said.

He also hopes that in this activity, students can play an active role in making socialization successful to positively impact the environment. The community is also expected to be able to participate in carbon emission reduction activities so that the environment can return to being beautiful and air health will improve.

"Let's work together to keep the environment beautiful again," he said.
