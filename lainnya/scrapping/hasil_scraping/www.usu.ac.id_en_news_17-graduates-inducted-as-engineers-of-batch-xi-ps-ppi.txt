“In line with the spirit of the engineering law, we hope that the graduates of the Professional Engineer Program can make a meaningful contribution to the progress of the nation and state,” said Prof. Muryanto.

USU PR - The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held the Inauguration of Engineers Batch XI of the USU Professional Engineer Education Study Program (PS PPI) for the academic year 2023/2024. It took place at the USU Faculty of Engineering Hall, on Thursday (01/02/2024).

PS PPI is a tangible manifestation of USU's commitment to supporting the development of engineering in Indonesia. As mandated by Government Regulation Number 25 of 2019 concerning Implementation Regulations of Law Number 11 of 2014 concerning Engineering, the purpose of this program is to ensure the acceleration of the fulfillment of professional and high-quality engineers.

Therefore, in his remarks, USU Rector Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, highlighted that today's inaugural event is not just a formality ceremony but also a concrete step in carrying out legal mandates and upholding professional integrity. This was marked by the signing of the Indonesian Engineers Code of Ethics or the Oath of Professional Engineers.

“In line with the spirit of the engineering law, we hope that the graduates of this Professional Engineer Program can make a meaningful contribution to the progress of the nation and state,” said Prof. Muryanto.

The next step after this inauguration is to process the Engineer Registration Certificate through the Indonesian Engineers Association (PII), which will provide official recognition of professional status. For this reason, the USU Rector hopes that FT USU Professional Engineer Program graduates will not only operate at the national level but also be competitive at the regional and even global levels.

“We live in an era of cross-border collaboration, and our graduates must be ready to face these dynamics. The quality of our graduates will be a reflection of the quality of education we provide,” explained Prof. Muryanto.

Prof. Dr. Ir. Fahmi S.T., M.Sc., IPM, as Dean of FT USU, emphasized that professional engineers must have basic competencies that have been given in the professional engineering program, namely ethics, work safety, environment, communication, team managerial, and networking. Not only that, the ability of a long-life learner is also the main point that professional engineers must have.

“Professional engineers must continue to improve their abilities because the field of engineering is developing significantly. What we learned 10 years ago may not be used anymore,” said Prof. Fahmi.

Head of PII North Sumatra Region, Dr. Ir. Ahmad Perwira Mulia Tarigan, M.Sc., stated that professional engineers who deserve to join PII are those who have high integrity and have a commitment not to be material-oriented.

For information, there are 17 graduates of Class XI of PS PPI USU out of 21 people who have successfully graduated and completed the entire educational process at PS PPI Regular Path and Recognition of Past Learning, where those inaugurated at this time are 3 Regular Pathway students and 14 RPL Pathway students.
