We all hope that this socialization can provide more detailed guidelines for meeting the indicators in the PKKM," said Vice Rector III.

USU PR - Socialization of the Independent Campus Competition Program (PK-KM) was held again by inviting Prof. Dr. Junaedi Muhidong, M.Sc. as a resource person. The socialization was held in the Academic Senate Meeting Room, on Friday (01/12/2023).

This socialization was held to welcome the 2024 Independent Campus Competition Program (PKKM) and the preparation of output-based activities. This socialization also helped in preparing important agendas and strategies that USU would carry out, as well as achieving internationalization.

Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., serves as USU's Deputy Rector III for Research, Community Service and Cooperation, explained that this activity is not only socialization but technical guidance on how to prepare a good proposal and is included in the PK-KM indicators

"We all hope that this socialization can provide more detailed guidelines for meeting the indicators in the PKKM," said Vice Rector III.

Furthermore, Vice Rector III also said that this could encourage the internationalization of every Study Program at USU, and it was also hoped that they would receive funding from this PK-KM.

"It will contribute to a leap of action in transforming higher education at an international level based on the advantages we have," he added.

Prof. Dr. Ir. Junaedi Muhidong, M.Sc, as a resource person at this socialization, explained that PK-KM is very important for universities because it can increase existing capacity on campus, such as increasing the competency of teaching staff and increasingly adequate facilities.

"So with this program, among other things, lecturer capacity can be improved. Laboratory capacity can be improved through these programs. Then also if there are improvements to laboratory facilities, equipment repairs, laboratory equipment is also covered by this," explained Prof. Junaedi.

Prof. Junaedi added that whenever preparing a proposal, the Study Program must pay attention to the terms and conditions in the guidelines so that the proposal is successfully passed.

"But because this is called a competition, of course, we want more than the minimum requirements so that the innovations in our proposals must be visible. "So that the national competition can be better so that we can win," he said.
