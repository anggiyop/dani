The visit of the NCI Regional Manager is his first visit to Indonesia, and immediately chose Medan as the first city and USU as the first university to explore the possibility of collaboration that can be done between NCI and USU.

USU PR - Vice Rector 3 of the University of North Sumatra (USU), Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan S.Si., M.Si., Apt, received the visit of the Regional Manager of the National College of Ireland (NCI), Harriet Le Good in the TTU Meeting Room, USU Central Bureau of Administration Building, on October 17, 2022.

The visit of the NCI Regional Manager was his first visit to Indonesia, and immediately chose Medan as the first city, and USU as the first university to explore the possibility of collaboration that could be done between NCI and USU. NCI itself is a university with two main academic programs, namely Economics and Computer Science. NCI hopes to collaborate with USU in both fields.

Collaboration plans discussed included joint publication, student exchange, double degree, and staff mobility. The possibility of collaboration is expected to begin with the making of an MoU as a basis for starting the realization of the desired collaboration by NCI and USU. Furthermore, the MoU is expected to open up great opportunities for faculties and study programs to make MoAs with more detailed collaborations in the future. (RJ)
