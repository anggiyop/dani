VALENCIA-USU PR: The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) continues to collaborate with various international higher education institutions. Currently, USU is part of the SPIRIT Project (Sport and physical education as a vehicle for Inclusion and Recognition in India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka), part of the Erasmus+ program series. The activity occurred at the Universitat Politécnica de Valéncia, Valencia City, Spain, 8-15 May 2022.

The USU team were consisted of the Faculty of Medicine and was chaired by Prof. Dr. dr. Dina Keumala Sari SpGK(K) with a group such as Prof. Dr. dr. Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked(OG) SpOG(K) who also served as Secretary of USU, Dr. Dr. Yetty Machrina, Dr. dr Dewi Masyithah Darlan SpPark, and Dr dr Fitriyani Nasution SpGK (K). They try to produce a syllabus/curriculum related to sports education which is included in the topics of Wellness Integrated Medicine, Physiology and Biochemistry, and Psychology and Exercise.

The agenda of activities also consists of training in preparing a syllabus on sports and nutrition education. This activity aims to produce a syllabus or curriculum on sports and nutrition education for undergraduate and master's degree students at USU. The curriculum that will be produced will later be compiled in the form of courses/educational blocks to be implemented.

The syllabus product that will be produced is also planned to be carried out online so that it can be applied at several universities abroad including Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, India, Sri Lanka. The event itself was attended by three universities in Asia, namely Indonesia, India, and Sri Lanka, with three universities in Europe cooperating with Cyprus, Spain, and Portugal. The Indonesian team came from USU, Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), and Syah Kuala University (USK).

In addition, on the occasion of this meeting, USU plans to establish cooperation in education, research, and community service with several foreign universities. It can be seen that several special meetings have been held between the Rectorate of the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia with USU and several representatives of other countries. The next meeting will be held at USU planned for June. After that, it will be held in Sri Lanka, but due to the current unstable situation in the country, it will be transferred to India. So far, all state universities involved in the SPIRIT project have shown great commitment to cooperating.
