USU PR- Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., the Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), has been honored for his attention to the development of digital talents in Indonesia, initiated by Huawei Indonesia in collaboration with the Office of the President of the Republic of Indonesia.

Rector Prof. Muryanto received the Indonesia Digital Talent Day 2023 award at Tarumanagara University, Jakarta. This event, in collaboration with the Office of the President and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, marks the culmination of a series of activities aimed at developing the digital talent ecosystem under the auspices of Huawei ASEAN Academy.

Under the leadership of Rector Prof. Muryanto Amin, the Universitas Sumatera Utara is currently constructing the Digital Learning Center Building (DLCB). This seven-story building, directly connected to the USU Rector's Office, will serve as a center for inclusive and environmentally friendly learning, equipped with advanced digital technology.

The Rector emphasized that the construction of DLCB is intended to support young talents, especially students, in developing their abilities in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and deepening research based on digitalization. The DLCB building is currently in the finishing stages and is expected to be operational in early 2024.

During the award presentation at Tarumanagara University, Chief of Presidential Staff Moeldoko expressed appreciation to Huawei for supporting the government's commitment to addressing the digital human resource disparity issue in Indonesia. "Huawei's contribution as a technology partner to the government is significant and meaningful for developing digital talent in Indonesia. The collaboration between the government and Huawei can prepare the younger generation as the determinants of Indonesia's future," said Moeldoko.

CEO of Huawei Indonesia, Mr. Long, emphasized that the contribution to developing capable digital talents in Indonesia, which has been ongoing since Huawei's presence in Indonesia over 23 years ago, will continue to be one of the sustainable agendas.
