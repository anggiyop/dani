"Academic friendships between UIN and USU are going better, warmer in the future. We pray that UIN Sunan Kalijaga can become a PTN-BH," Prof. Siswanto said.

USU Public Relations - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) received a visit from Sunan Kalijaga State Islamic University (UIN Suka) to discuss PTN-BH. UIN Suka visit was greeted directly by Deputy Rector II for Human Resources and Finance at USU, Muhammad Arifin Nasution S.Sos., M.Sp., in the Academic Senate Room of USU's Central Bureau of Administration Building on Tuesday, (11/08/2022).

USU is one of 21 universities with the status of PTN-BH (State University Legal Entity) in Indonesia. USU was officially designated as a BH PTN through Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 16 of 2014. In September 2022, USU was entrusted with hosting the Indonesian PTN-BH academic senate session.

Based on this, several universities in Indonesia visited USU with the intention of consulting on the transformation into a PTN-BH, one of which was UIN Sunan Kalijaga.

Vice Rector I for Academic Affairs and Institutional Development at UIN Suka Prof. Dr. Iswandi Syahputra, M.Si said that UIN Suka was preparing to transform from PTN BLU (Public Service Agency) to PTN BH, so that UIN Suka chose USU as a place for benchmarking in the process towards PTN-BH.

"We see USU as a Legal Entity College, which has a reputation and success. It was not in vain that we came here to get a lot of things, a lot of information as well as a lot of help," WR I UIN Sunan Kalijaga said.

After receiving information from USU on this visit, UIN Suka will follow up on a number of things such as formulating academic concepts and documents for the transition process from PTN-BLU to PTN-BH.

WR I UIN Sunan Kalijaga really wants USU's willingness to become a mentor to help UIN Suka when experiencing problems in the process of transforming into PTN BH.

"If you wish, we invite you as a mentor for us in the transformation process," he said.

Meanwhile, the Head of the Academic Senate Prof. Dr. Siswanto Masruri, M.A. hopes that UIN Suka will soon become PTN BH, and that academic relations between the two universities namely USU and UIN Suka can become warmer and run well in the future.
