Let's improve the implementation system. Until now, the supplementary RKA has been recorded separately, creating the impression of having two RKA systems at USU. We need to integrate them, so that the supplementary RKA system still exists but within the same RKA system, with only slight differences in management," Prof. Opim explained.

HUMAS USU - Prof. Dr. Opim Salim Sitompul, M.Sc., the Vice Rector IV for Information, Planning, and Development of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), led the regular morning briefing session in the yard of GBPA USU.

The session was attended by all the units under the leadership of Prof. Opim, including the Directorate of Digitalization and System Integration, the Bureau of Information Systems, Planning, and Development, the Priority Program Evaluation Section, and the Information Systems Center (PSI).

During the session, Prof. Opim addressed several important points that each unit needs to focus on. Among them, he directed the Sirenbanh Bureau to implement activities in accordance with the RKA (Annual Work Plan and Budget), evaluate the initial budget requests submitted by the units, raise awareness about DBA (Budget Execution Documents), ensure detailed budget activities, and conduct RKA socialization.

Prof. Opim expressed his hope that all work units can enhance the implementation procedures in the RKA system, ensuring that all activities are carried out as planned and achieve the target, specifically the Main Performance Index.

"Let's strive to execute all planned activities, ensuring that each unit, whether it is a bureau, an agency, or a directorate, can carry out their activities. The most important thing is to achieve the target. Our key target is the IKU (Main Performance Index)," he concluded.
