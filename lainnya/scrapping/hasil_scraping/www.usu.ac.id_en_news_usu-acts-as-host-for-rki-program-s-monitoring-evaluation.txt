I believe the benefits will be significant, as we will have the opportunity to present our programs and offer even stronger collaborations for the future achievements of the university," said USU Vice Rector III.

USU PR - Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) hosted the Monitoring and Evaluation (MONEV) of the Final Report/Seminar on the Results of the Indonesian Collaboration Research Program (RKI). The event took place at the USU Student Center on Thursday (12/14/2023).

The MONEV was attended by the Chairperson of the RKI Forum, Prof. Dr. Mirwan Ushada, S.T.P., M.App.Life.Sc., and the Head of the Research and Community Service Institute (LPPM) at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Dr. Ir. Yuli Setyo Indartono, S.T., M.T.

USU Vice Rector III, Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Zaitun Hasibuan, S.Si., M.Si., Apt., stated that the MONEV held at USU would open opportunities to present various collaboration programs with USU, aiming to enhance the university's achievements.

"I believe the benefits will be significant, as we will have the opportunity to present our programs and offer even stronger collaborations for the future achievements of the university," said VR III USU.

Vice Rector III USU hoped that research at USU would increase in quantity and quality, providing positive impacts that can be cited globally.

"The hope is that research at Universitas Sumatera Utara will get closer. Then, the publications will also improve. Not only in quantity but also in quality, and all the research results from lecturers can have an impact and be cited worldwide," added Prof. Poppy.

Head of the USU Research Institute, Prof. Dr. Robert Sibarani, M.S., explained that the increase in the number of State Universities (PTN BH) from the previous year, from 16 to 21 PTN BH, had a positive impact on the number of participants and research titles. There were 162 research titles, 21 of which were part of the research conducted by the LPPM of each PTN BH in Indonesia.

"The first is the MONEV, monitoring and evaluating 162 research titles of 21 Research and Community Service Institutes from PTN BH throughout Indonesia. Last year there were still 16 PTN BH, now 21," explained Prof. Robert.

Prof. Dr. Robert Sibarani, M.S., added that the research mentioned is multidisciplinary to open up more opportunities for collaboration, and issues in society can be solved with multidisciplinary knowledge.

"All fields of science, but it is indeed focused on a multidisciplinary approach. Therefore, I think this is an opportunity to collaborate. Not only the researchers collaborate but also the fields of science so that we can solve the problems faced by this nation in a multidisciplinary way," added Prof. Robert.

Director of the USU Directorate of Internationalization and Global Partnerships, Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., M.T., explained that the equity program is intended for all PTN BH in Indonesia, providing financial assistance to improve the quality of universities to be known internationally. Almost 1/3 of the total equity funds must be allocated for research.

"So, if it can be made in simpler terms, it is about improving the quality of our education so that we are known internationally. Well, it can be said that almost 1/3 of this equity funding must support research," explained Prof. Himsar.

Prof. Dr. Eng. Himsar Ambarita, S.T., M.T., emphasized that the MONEV activity offers several collaboration opportunities to researchers and serves as a reference to improve the quality of research conducted by USU.

"Well, with the entry of this equity, we expect diversification or strengthening of what already exists. Added with new programs that we can do together. That's about it. Because, coincidentally, all the researchers collaborating are gathered here, we use that opportunity to offer several collaboration opportunities, approximately like that," affirmed Prof. Himsar.
