USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: The Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) supports the efforts of the North Sumatra Regional Police (Polda) in implementing wider vaccination in their working areas. USU also attended the additional Vaccinators Readiness Meeting in North Sumatra, on Wednesday (7/7/2021), at the Prasetya Catur Hall, North Sumatra Police Office.

During the meeting, the Deputy Chief of the Regional Police (Wakapolda) of North Sumatra, Brigadier General Dadang Hartanto, stated that his party had prepared personnel and strategies for the implementation of additional vaccinations.

"We are preparing vaccinator personnels in collaboration with the North Sumatra Health Office. The North Sumatra Police itself has 453 vaccinators, collaborating with 4934 vaccinators from the Health Service," Mardiaz said.

He said, his staff had made a series of efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19. These efforts are made to help the government suppress the increase in the increasing number of positive confirmed cases.

"We have made various efforts to suppress the spread of Covid-19. We are trying to minimize community mobilization, especially in North Sumatra. In addition, we have also given advice and outreach to the community," he added.

Mardiaz said there was an increase in daily confirmed cases in North Sumatra to 256 cases as of July 6, 2021. According to him, the increase was related to the movement of people during the 2021 Eid al-Fitr celebration.

USU's Vice Rector V, Ir Luhut Sihombing, M.P., said USU was ready to support the North Sumatra Regional Police program. He said, USU had vaccinated most of the academic community within USU.

“USU has administered vaccines to all education staff and lecturers within USU. Only some of them have not been vaccinated because there are criteria that are not met for vaccination. We hope that this vaccination program can touch USU students who have not been vaccinated," Luhut said.

Mardiaz Kusin said, the role of all parties in helping and making the vaccine activity a success was the key. He believed that the North Sumatra Police could not run alone to carry out the program.

“We need the support and contribution of all parties, both from the community elements and from agencies and institutions. We should have the same perception to encourage the implementation of vaccines in North Sumatra,” Mardiaz said.

The USU Secretary, Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked. (OG)., Sp.OG (K), USU's Deputy Head of the Covid Task Force, Dr. Inke Nadia Diniyanti Lubis, M.Ked. (Ped.), Sp.A., PhD, also attended the event., the Executives of the State University of Medan, the Executives of Community Organizations in the North Sumatra region, and invited guests. (RR/YH-©ULC)
