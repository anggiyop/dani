The Dean of USU's FISIP Drs. Hendra Harahap, M.Si, Ph.D said, this collaboration is a manifestation of the implementation of MBKM to achieve USU's Key Performance Indicators (IKU).

USU PR - Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with FISIP Bengkulu University (UNIB) as an implementation of MBKM cooperation, as well as holding a national seminar. The event was held at USU's FISIP Hall, Thursday (12/09/2021).

The Dean of USU's FISIP Drs. Hendra Harahap, M.Si., Ph.D. said, this collaboration is a manifestation of the implementation of MBKM to achieve USU's Key Performance Indicators (IKU).

"This collaboration will start in 2022. The assessment of the cooperation will be of high value if it is also carried out by the faculty, especially the study program," he said.

Hendra, PhD added, many things can be learned outside the university. There are programs that will be collaborated with UNIB.

"It is possible to complement each other's programs or activities, for example in the field of student affairs," said the Dean of FISIP.

According to him, not only cooperation in the framework of education, it is possible to form cooperation in other fields. For example holding seminars or sharing knowledge between USU and UNIB FISIP.

"If it can be initiated between USU's FISIP and UNIB's FISIP, work together to hold joint championships or festivals in various fields for students from various study programs," he said.

Hendra, Ph.D. hopes that the collaboration can strengthen the enthusiasm and willingness of students to achieve.

On this occasion, the Dean of FISIP UNIB, Dr. Yunilisiah, M.Si. introduced the profile of FISIP UNIB to see what potential collaborations can be done with USU's FISIP.

"We will discuss what cooperation can be established. Not only related to the Tridarma of higher education, we will also hold competitions or festivals together," said the Dean of FISIP UNIB.

Dr. Yunilisiah, M.Si. hopes that USU's FISIP and UNIB's FISIP can collaborate to improve the KPI of each university.

"With this collaboration, USU's FISIP and UNIB's FISIP can also further develop and improve student achievement," he said.
