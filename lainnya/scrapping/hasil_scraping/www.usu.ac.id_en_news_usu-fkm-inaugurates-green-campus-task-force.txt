"Actually, this cannot be separated from how we make these students more responsible before we release them into the alumni category in the field. This means that from here we have equipped them with how to truly implement a clean, healthy, neat, and energy-efficient culture," said WD I FKM USU

Public Relations USU—The Faculty of Public Health, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), inaugurated the Green Campus Task Force (Satgas) on Wednesday (12/21/2022) at the Academic Studio of the Faculty of Public Health. The Green Campus Task Force aims to increase student environmental and energy sustainability awareness.

Vice Dean I of the Faculty of Public Health, Universitas Sumatera Utara Dr. Umi Salmah, S.K.M., M.Kes explained that students will gradually increase their responsibility towards the environment as they assume their roles.

"Actually, this cannot be separated from how we make these students more responsible before we release them into the alumni category in the field. This means that from here we have equipped them with how to truly implement a clean, healthy, neat, and energy-efficient culture," said WD I FKM USU

On the other hand, the Head of the Public Health Science Undergraduate Study Program, Faculty of Public Health, USU, Dr. Ir. Evi Naria, M.Kes, said that to create a more organized campus, all academics and students are encouraged to be involved in the Green Campus program. Not only valid for 1 period but it is hoped that this Green Campus can continue indefinitely.

"Of course, because we have given responsibility, we will also be together. Of course, they can carry out their duties as well as possible. Yes, they must maintain the sustainability of the campus and also be able to provide an example to their younger siblings. Well, besides that, we also hope that what they will do later can be sustainable," said the Head of the Public Health Science Study Program FKM USU

To reflect the brand of Universitas Sumatera Utara, the FKM Green Campus Task Force Abiyu Ghaly Siddiq will start the work program from the smallest things such as warnings given to those who smoke or litter.

"For the work program plan, as previously stated, there is responsibility. So what we will do is reprimand students who litter, smoke and do not reflect the campus brand itself," said a 2020 FKM student

With great enthusiasm, the Green Campus Task Force Raja Barani Lubis, also a 2020 FKM student, hopes that this Green Campus program can motivate other faculty members at USU to move forward together.

"And maybe I would add to motivate other faculties at USU to move forward together to bring Green Campus to life," said the Green Campus Task Force.
