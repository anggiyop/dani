The USU PKM-RE team presented a presentation entitled "Utilization of Carbon Nanofiber Film Chemosensors from Batang Kecombrang (Etlingera Elatior) as a Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Sensitive Material". Team Leader Wardhani Septina Sembiring explained that their research has the potential to provide information to the public regarding the use of kecombrang stems as chemosensory material. "Meanwhile, in the medical field, their research has the potential to create a prostate cancer diagnosis tool," she said.

USU PR - The 34th National Student Scientific Week (PIMNAS) Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) entered the presentation and judging stage, Wednesday (10/27/2021). In this first session, the USU Team presented about the benefits of kecombrang and smart wheelchairs with ultrasonic sensors.

The USU PKM-RE team presented a presentation entitled "Utilization of Carbon Nanofiber Film Chemosensors from Kecombrang (Etlingera elatior) stems as a Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Sensitive Material".

Team Leader Wardhani Septina Sembiring explained that their research has the potential to provide information to the public regarding the use of kecombrang stems as chemosensory material.

"Meanwhile, in the medical field, their research has the potential to create a prostate cancer diagnosis tool," she said.

The PKM-Karsa Cipta (KC) Team from USU presented the title "Smart Wheel Chair to Improve Mobility for the Blind with Ultrasonic Sensors and Thermometers as Application of Health Protocols during a Pandemic".

Chairman of the USU PKM-KC Team, Muhammad Atqa Adzkia Zaldy, explained that this innovation was made to increase the mobility of the blind as an implementation of health protocols in the midst of a pandemic.

"The use of sticks is less effective for carrying out health protocols," he said in a presentation.

For information, each participant is given 10 minutes of presentation time, after which the judges will ask questions for 15 minutes.

The judging and presentation of the USU PIMNAS finalists was held for two days, Wednesday and Thursday (October 27-28, 2021). The contested fields include 9 programs, namely PKM-Constructive Futuristic Ideas, PKM-Written Ideas, PKM-Entrepreneurship, PKM-Karsa Cipta, PKM-Innovative Works, PKM-Iptek Application, PKM-Community Service, PKM-Science Research and PKM- Social Research.

There were 3,126 students who were members of 735 PKM groups who made presentations online and offline through the live streaming room on USU's youtube channel. A total of 35 judging classes were prepared spread over 17 judging classes at the USU Faculty of Dentistry and 18 judging classes at the USU Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology. Each judging class accommodates 21 participating teams.

In each room, three judges conduct a review and assessment of the participant's Student Creativity Proposal (PKM). Each team will present their best proposal in front of the judges.

USU Rector Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos, M.Si., gave motivation to the participants to keep up the spirit and never give up. The Rector hopes that the participants will continue to improve their competence and capacity so that they can become agents of change and lead to a better Indonesia.

“One thing we must remember in the implementation of the 34th PIMNAS is that winning or losing is common. What is extraordinary is the struggle, ideas and inspiration of all of you, which are poured with the spirit of renewal and fiery creativity,” Muryanto said. (©ULC)
