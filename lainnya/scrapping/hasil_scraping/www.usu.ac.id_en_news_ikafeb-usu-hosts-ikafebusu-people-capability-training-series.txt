USU PR - The Alumni Association of Economics & Business Faculty at Universitas Sumatera Utara (IKAFEB USU) proudly organized another high-quality event, the "Ikafebusu People Capability Training Series (IPCTS)," on Saturday, May 4, 2024. The event occurred at the Lake Toba Hall, Mandiri Tower, on Jalan Pulau Pinang and was attended by 203 participants from various colleges and universities in Medan.

 

The IPCTS is a flagship program designed to enhance the personal capacities of students and 'fresh graduate' alumni through training in life skills and soft skills. This initiative has been successfully conducted twice: the first batch, "Basic Life Skill," in September 2023, and the second batch, "Ethic and Knowledge," in March 2024.

 

Chairperson Emi Wakhyuni stated that the theme for the third batch of IPCTS is "Precise Strategy for Job Applicant," which is deemed highly relevant to the "2024 State-Owned Enterprises Joint Recruitment." She noted, "The material presented is expected to be immediately applicable by the participants during the joint recruitment stages."

 

Notably, the training was attended not only by students from the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) at USU but also by students from public and private higher education institutions in Medan. Emi emphasized the training's goal to broadly impact students and 'fresh graduate' alumni in the city. She extended her gratitude to all stakeholders involved in the event's organization, including the IKAFEB USU chairperson, the Regional Head of Bank Mandiri, lecturers, deans of public and private universities, and all enthusiastic participants.

 

The event was inaugurated by the Dean of FEB USU, Dr. Fadli, S.E, M.Si., who expressed appreciation for the participants' eagerness and commitment to preparing for the workforce. He also thanked the IKAFEB USU for organizing the event aimed at boosting the capacities of students and alumni through the IPCTS.

 

The third batch of IPCTS included two sessions led by three proficient speakers. The first session, presented by Ade Marina Dwitasari, Assistant Vice President of Talent Acquisition at Bank Mandiri, covered "Crafting Your Perfect CV & Unlocking Your Interview Success," featuring an interview simulation practice.

 

The second session was delivered by Liston Simanjuntak, S.E. Ak, MBA, Finance Director at PT Askrindo and Head of Career Development at Ikafebusu, focusing on "From Here to There," emphasizing the importance of a 'Player' and 'Learner' mentality for career success. The final session by Agus Dwi Handaya, S.E., Ak, MBA, Director of Compliance & Human Capital at Bank Mandiri and Chair of IKAFEB USU, discussed "Elevate Your Early Through Excellent Preparation," exploring six essential skills and attitudes for career success.
