“With this institution, we hope to issue a nationally recognized certificate of competence, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health,” said Dr. Zulfendri.

USU PR - The Rector of the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si., received an audience from the Health Training Institute team to discuss the establishment of the Health Training Institute. The meeting took place in the USU Rector's Audience Room, on Wednesday (14/08/2024).

The plan to establish a new Health Training Institute under USU is an initiative to strengthen the university's role in improving the quality of education and training in the health sector. Although this idea has received initial approval from the USU Rector, the process of developing the institution still requires long and comprehensive steps before it can be realized.

Dr. Drs. Zulfendri, M.Kes., who represented the Health Training Institute team, said that this initiative is an effort to establish an institution capable of providing accredited and standardized health training. The training institute will have an important role in improving the quality of human resources in the health sector, including USU alumni who need further training.

“With this institution, we hope to issue a nationally recognized certificate of competence, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health,” said Dr. Zulfendri.

Dr. Drs. Zulfendri, M.Kes., also highlighted that this training institute will be one of USU's efforts in following in the footsteps of other universities that already have similar institutions. He hopes that the institute can meet the training needs within USU, with full support from the resources and facilities that the university already has.

“We hope this institution can be accredited soon and start running various trainings needed by USU alumni and students,” he added.

In addition, Muhammad Sukri Tanjung, S.Kep., Ns., added that the establishment of this institution is part of an effort to expand the role of lecturers in the Tridharma of Higher Education, which includes teaching, research, and community service. She hopes the institute can expand opportunities for lecturers to contribute to training, apart from other academic tasks.

“The institute is expected to support the increased creativity of lecturers in training, in addition to teaching and research tasks,” Sukri hoped.
