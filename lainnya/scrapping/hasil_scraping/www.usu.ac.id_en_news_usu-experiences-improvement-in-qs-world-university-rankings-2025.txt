The most significant improvement was seen in the Employer Reputation indicator, where USU dramatically improved its position from 932 to 824, indicating that USU graduates are increasingly recognized in the job market.

 

USU PR—Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) has achieved a notable accomplishment by climbing in the QS World University Rankings 2025. From its previous position of 1233, USU has risen to 1207 this year, marking a strong commitment to enhancing educational standards and global reputation.

The most significant improvement was seen in the Employer Reputation indicator, where USU dramatically improved its position from 932 to 824, indicating that USU graduates are increasingly recognized in the job market. Additionally, Academic Reputation also saw a significant rise, moving from 967 to 901, reinforcing USU's image as an excellent academic institution.

Despite facing challenges, such as a decline in the Citations per Faculty indicator from 1406 to 1430 and a drop in Employment Outcomes from 997 to 1017, USU demonstrated meaningful progress in other areas. The increase in the International Faculty Ratio from 775 to 716 reflects USU’s commitment to expanding its international teaching presence on its campus.

On the other hand, while the International Student ratio saw a slight improvement from 1155 to 1146, and USU's Sustainability ranking dropped from 769 to 809, the improvement in the Faculty Student Ratio from 646 to 595 shows that USU continues to strive to provide quality learning experiences for its students.

Overall, USU's performance in the QS World University Rankings 2025 demonstrates a firm commitment to improving the quality of education and its international reputation. With a focus on innovation and continuous improvement, USU is ready to face global challenges in the future and maintain its position at the forefront of global higher education.
