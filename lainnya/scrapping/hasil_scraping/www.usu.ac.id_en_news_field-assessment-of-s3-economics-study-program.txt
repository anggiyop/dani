This assessment will serve as an indicator of the successful implementation of the work programs carried out and an evaluation of any existing shortcomings, both in the academic and administrative service sectors, both internally and externally," he explained

HUMAS USU - The Institute for Self-Accreditation of Business Management Economics and Accounting (LAMEMBA) conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the Economics Doctoral Study Program at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). This assessment took place at the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto Hall of FEB USU from Monday to Wednesday, May 29th to 31st, 2023.

Representing the USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si, the USU Vice Rector II for Human Resources and Finance, Muhammad Arifin Nasution, S.Sos., M.SP, warmly welcomed the two LAMEMBA assessment teams, consisting of Prof. Dr. Taufiq Marwa, SE. M.Si from Sriwijaya University, and Prof. Dr. Ambya, S.E., M.Si from Lampung University.

"We express our gratitude and extend a warm welcome to the Assessors Team from the Institute for Self-Accreditation of Business Management Economics and Accounting (LAMEMBA), who have graciously joined us for this Assessment activity, which is an integral part of the accreditation process," stated M. Arifin.

Field assessment is a crucial step in the accreditation process of study programs or universities. Therefore, in his address, the USU Vice Rector II emphasized that the successful implementation of work programs in both the academic and administrative service sectors, both internally and externally, would serve as the foundation for accreditation assessment.

"This assessment will serve as an indicator of the successful implementation of the work programs carried out and an evaluation of any existing shortcomings, both in the academic and administrative service sectors, both internally and externally," he explained.

In alignment with these objectives, Dr. Fadli, SE, MSi, the Dean of FEB USU, has compiled a national accreditation document that supports the internationalization of a world-class university. This endeavor aims to uphold USU's position as an institution that exceeds national standards of higher education.

"We have already surpassed the national standards of higher education. Furthermore, we have supported the university's efforts, which stem from the ministry's performance contract, towards the internationalization of a world-class university through the preparation of national accreditation documents," stated Dr. Fadli.

The Dean of FEB USU expressed hope that the Doctor of Economics program would embody the vision, mission, and the realization of the Tri Dharma principles, along with other educational services provided by USU. This would enable the Doctor of Economics program to achieve excellence and become a distinguished S3 study program.

"Our aspiration is to excel in our endeavors, which entails realizing the vision and mission of the university, which is passed down to the faculty and, specifically, the Doctor of Economics program. We hope that this will manifest through our commitment to the Tri Dharma principles of higher education and our dedication to creating globally competitive graduates," concluded Dr. Fadli.

Prof. Dr. Taufiq Marwa, SE. M.Si, one of the assessors, highlighted that the assessment is a regular activity conducted to evaluate the implementation and accomplishments in carrying out the Tri Dharma of higher education. The assessment process focuses on nine specific aspects to ensure their effective implementation.

"We will be examining the nine key areas in the implementation of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education in the study program. This is a routine activity that must be conducted to guarantee the proper execution of the Tri Dharma process within universities, study programs, and faculties," explained Prof. Taufiq.
