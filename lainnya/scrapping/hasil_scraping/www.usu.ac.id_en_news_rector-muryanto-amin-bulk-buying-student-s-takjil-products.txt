USU PR - The Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, SSos, MSi, supports the entrepreneurship of students who sell “Takji”l (Iftar snacks) around the campus, Thursday (6/4).

Prof. Mury carried out the form of support by visiting the USU students' merchandise location around Jalan Dr. Mansyur and buying the Takjil being sold.

In the video shared on Instagram @muryantoamin, this political science professor is seen familiarly dialoguing with students and taking selfies together.

"I asked them what they thought was good and bad about selling. They said it was fun to learn to make money, and they said the proceeds from the sales would be donated to other places," said Prof. Mury, who rode around on an electric scooter.

The Rector also appreciated the spirit and enthusiasm of those who developed the entrepreneurial spirit and hoped that the entrepreneurial spirit would continue to be instilled.

"So they want to learn entrepreneurship is a positive value that should be appreciated. The profits donated also inspire us that the importance of sharing. Share is care," he said.
