I greet and thank you for completing numerous learning support facilities and public facilities that have been programmed at FISIP USU, notably the Digital Library and FISIP Cafe named Kafe Temu Tengah, as well as Green Open Space/parks and Pedestrians," he stated in a speech

Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, Rector of Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), opened the Digital Library, Temu Tengah Café, Green Open Space, and Pedestrian of FISIP USU. The inauguration was commemorated by writing an inscription and cutting a ribbon at the FISIP USU Central Meeting Café on Friday, October 2, 2023.

The USU Rector praised the completion of this facility's construction. This freshly opened public facility is supposed to facilitate academic and non-academic activities at FISIP USU.

"I greet and thank you for completing numerous learning support facilities and public facilities that have been programmed at FISIP USU, notably the Digital Library and FISIP Cafe named Kafe Temu Tengah, as well as Green Open Space/parks and Pedestrians," he stated in a speech.

According to the Rector, the building of the Digital Library is a solution for accessing the FISIP USU Library. This facility is intended to improve the effectiveness of Tri Dharma implementation. Nevertheless, Kafe Temu Tengah is a culinary innovation in the USU atmosphere. This cafe is accessible to the general public. Furthermore, Pedestrian and Green Open Spaces are present as facilities analogous to oases. Both areas can be used for meetings or simply relaxing in the fresh air.

With the establishment of this new building, the Rector anticipates a new spirit in the activities of the entire academic community of FISIP USU.

"With the establishment of this facility, I expect that the entire FISIP USU academic community will be more tenacious and enthusiastic in carrying out their roles and obligations. Furthermore, FISIP USU is one of the most popular faculties at USU, and it is projected to make a significant contribution to society, nation, and state, "Muryanto Amin said.

PT Bank Tabungan Negara Tbk provided money to build Green Open Space and Pedestrian FISIP USU. PT Bank Tabungan Negara (Persero) Tbk Medan Branch Manager Carly Tambunan stated that the funding was BTN's contribution to the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative by providing or renovating campus facilities.

"Therefore, as part of our CSR to campuses, we at Bank BTN donate to USU in terms of provision or repair. Now, USU is already a part of Bank BTN because Bank BTN clients have been with us for a long time, and we contribute a form of CSR fund to USU Campus, "Carly Tambunan elaborated.

According to Carly Tambunan, introducing these facilities can shift the flow of learning that was previously rigorous and contained indoors to be more relaxed in open settings.
