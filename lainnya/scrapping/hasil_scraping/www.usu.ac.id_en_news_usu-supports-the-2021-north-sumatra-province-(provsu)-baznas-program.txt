USU PUBLIC RELATIONS – MEDAN: Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) fully supports the program of the National Amil Zakat Agency (Baznas) of North Sumatra Province. This form of support was marked by the presence of the Secretary of the University, Prof. Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked (OG) in the Rijal Nurdin T Hall, the Governor's Office House.

Prof. Fidel said that USU's other support for the Baznas program is that every year USU collects zakat from USU employees and lecturers.The zakat collected by USU was thenhanded over to the Provincial Baznas.

"But by Baznas it was returned to USU to be distributed to those who are entitled to receive it, especially in our own environment at the Universitas Sumatera Utara," he said.

Prof. Fidel explained that currently there is no zakat charity at USU.In the future, through coordination with the USU Rector, his party will form a zakat charity so that zakat management within USU can be more coordinated and the distribution is right ontarget.

Head of USU's Zakat Collection Unit, Nazaruddin, S.Sos., emphasized that the zakat collection program at USU is to give advice to employees or lecturers to givezakat which is managed by USU.

"We have collected it for two years. We give forms to faculties that have earned income to issue 2.5 percent zakat or 80 grams of gold every year, if the income is that much we urge them to pay zakat," he said.

Nazaruddin asserted that because it is only an appeal, the collection is still not optimal.Nevertheless, the team continues to try to remind the academic community through the forms that are distributed.If there is a zakat charity within USU, it will certainly be moremassive in collecting zakat at USU.

The 2021 Zakat Rakorda activity itself, apart from being filled with guidance and direction from the Governor of North Sumatra Edy Rahmayadi and the Chairman of the Indonesian National Baznas Prof. Dr. KH Noor Achmad, MA, was also filled with symbolic handing over of aid in the form of agriculture, fisheries, animal husbandry, taking care of clerics, taking care of orphanages, scholarships and religious venues (mosques) in Madina.
