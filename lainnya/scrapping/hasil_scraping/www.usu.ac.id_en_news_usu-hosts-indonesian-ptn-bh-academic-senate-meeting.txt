The session was entitled Identification of Problems and Solutions for Implementing Community Service in Supporting the Success of Independent Learning, Independent Campus (MBKM). As is known, the implementation of MBKM is one of the scopes of the duties and functions of the Academic Senate in each university. Coordination and collaboration between universities, especially those with PTN-BH status, are considered important to maximize the implementation of the MBKM program.

The activity also featured a discussion session with three speakers, namely Plt. Director of Learning and Student Affairs of the Ministry of Education and Culture and Research and Technology Dr. Ir. Sri Gunani Partiwi, MT presented the topic of Community Service Policy in Supporting the Success of MBKM, and Vice Chancellor III of USU Prof. Dr. Poppy Anjelisa Hasibuan with the topic of Identification of Problems and Solutions for the Implementation of Community Service in Supporting the Success of MBKM (Case Study at the University of North Sumatra).

This moment is also an opportunity to present ideas from 16 PTN-BH regarding the determination of the success of their MBKM with an emphasis on the Community Outreach Program. The implementation of MBKM is directed at Community Service, which lecturers routinely carry out. Through this meeting, recommendations were made so that lecturers also involve students in carrying out Community Service as a form of responsibility for implementing the Tri Dharma.

This is expected to create students who experience an increase in their employee ability reputation in the eyes of industry and society. When students graduate, the world of work can directly employ them, or their creativity can open up employment opportunities. Thus, the improvement of this Community Service program is expected to create highly adaptive intellectual resources in the journey of community life. Through this meeting, we can contribute to perfecting the Community Service program of each PTN-BH.
