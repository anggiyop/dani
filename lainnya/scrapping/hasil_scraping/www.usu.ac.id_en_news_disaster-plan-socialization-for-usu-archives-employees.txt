As a Higher Education Archives Institution, Universitas Sumatera Utara, through the University Archives Office, supports the mandate of the Regulation of the Head of the National Archives of the Republic of Indonesia Number 23 of 2011 concerning Guidelines for the Preservation of Static Archives, so it is hoped that participants will be able to understand all of the explanations given by the speakers who will provide socialization", said the University Archives Office.

USU PR - The Archives Office at Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Disaster Plan Socialization titled "Ready to Face Disasters and Fires to Save Vital University Archives." Gema Halelu Is, ST, MT., Head of the Safety Division of the Medan City Fire and Rescue Service, delivered the socialization in the GBPA USU Senate Room on Tuesday (09/10/2023).

Prof. Dr. dr. Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar, M. Ked (OG), Sp. OG (K)-Fer, the Secretary of the University, stated on this occasion that this activity was carried out to increase the skills and knowledge of archive office staff in disaster management.

"As a Higher Education Archives Institution, Universitas Sumatera Utara, through the University Archives Office, supports the mandate of the Regulation of the Head of the National Archives of the Republic of Indonesia Number 23 of 2011 concerning Guidelines for the Preservation of Static Archives, so it is hoped that participants will be able to understand all of the explanations given by the speakers who will provide socialization."

This Disaster Plan is a disaster-prevention strategy. Aisyah, S.E., M.Si., Head of the USU Archives Office, described three steps in a disaster plan: prevention, emergency response, and recovery.

"The first step is preventive action, the second is an emergency response when it happens, and the third is recovery, so recovery after the disaster or fire," she stated.

The archive office staff were not only theoretically prepared, but they were also given practical training when socialization was presented.

"Later, we will not only listen to Mr. Gema's material from today, but we also have practice, so we will practice directly down to use the APAR Light Fire Extinguisher," explained the Head of the USU Archives Office.

According to Gema Halelu Is, ST, MT., the material covered in this exercise included fire causes, ways to prevent fires, and procedures to limit losses caused by fire disasters.

"First, there's the fire itself and how to keep it from becoming a fire." So, how do you keep fire and heat from igniting? The third is how to prevent what preparations need to be made because if there is a fire, we are prepared to deal with it so that the fire does not create a significant loss," Gema said on the sidelines of the meeting.
