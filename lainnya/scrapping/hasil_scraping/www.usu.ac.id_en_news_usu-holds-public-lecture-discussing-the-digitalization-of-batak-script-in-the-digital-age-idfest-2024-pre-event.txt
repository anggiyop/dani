USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos. M.Si., who was represented by the Director of the USU Education Development Directorate, Dr. Muhammad Anggia Muchtar. S.T.

He invited all parties to be actively involved in cultural preservation through technology. He also said that USU strongly supports efforts to preserve culture through a digital approach.

“We see technology as a powerful tool to bridge the past and the future,” Anggia said.

Meanwhile, Muhammad Rangga Danusa as PANDI's Business Strategic Manager revealed PANDI's commitment to improving digital literacy in Indonesia, working with various universities to create passion among the younger generation in website development and information access.
