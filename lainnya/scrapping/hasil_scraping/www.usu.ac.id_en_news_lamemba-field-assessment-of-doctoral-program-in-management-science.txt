"This visitation has two messages that we need to see. The first is from the assessors about information sharing. Secondly, sharing this experience, in my opinion, the study program must also have strong management knowledge,” said the USU Rector.

USU PR - The Institute for Self-Accreditation of Business Management Economics and Accounting (LAMEMBA) immediately held an accreditation field assessment for the Management Science Study Program of the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU). The field assessment brought in two teams of assessors, namely Prof. Dr. Mohamad Rizan, SE., M.M from Universitas Negeri Jakarta (UNJ), and Prof. Dr. Vanessa Gaffar, S.E, Ak. MBA from Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). This activity was carried out in the Prof. Dr. Suhadji Hadibroto FEB USU Hall on Tuesday (06/02/2024).

USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin, S.Sos., M.Si, said that the field assessment activity was a driving force in improving the quality of each study program at USU. This field assessment conveys two messages, namely to share information about knowledge and experience between the assessor team and the Doctoral Program in Management Science.

“This visitation has two messages that we need to see. The first is from the assessors about information sharing. Secondly, sharing this experience, in my opinion, the study program must also have strong management knowledge,” said the USU Rector.

The Dean of FEB USU, Dr. Fadli, S.E., M.Si, said that accreditation is not just a symbol but a motivation to continue to maintain and improve quality and encourage the acceleration of internationalization in FEB, especially in the Doctoral Program in Management Science.

“Accreditation is not only a symbol of Higher Education but also a motivation and promise for organizers to always maintain and improve and provide the best spirit in the future,” he explained.

The assessor team I, Prof. Dr. Mohamad Rizan, SE, M.M, explained that the assessment criteria focused on 3 (three) criteria, namely Three Pillars of Higher Education, Cooperation, and Outputs of the Doctoral Program in Management Science. The assessment also evaluates every document and data that has been provided.

“There are 3 criteria, the first is Three Pillars of Dharma, then Cooperation, then Outputs,” he said.
