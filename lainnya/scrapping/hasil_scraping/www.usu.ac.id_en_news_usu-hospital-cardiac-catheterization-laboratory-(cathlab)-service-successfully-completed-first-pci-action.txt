USU PUBLIC RELATION-MEDAN: Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (Cathlab) service at the University of North Sumatra Hospital which has been started since June 9th, 2021, has successfully completed the first Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) for patients, Wednesday (4/8/2021). The Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (Cath Lab) is a superior facility owned by the University of North Sumatra Hospital for the field of diagnostic and therapeutic services for heart and blood vessel disease, which has been around since early 2018.

Director of Medical and Nursing Services at USU Hospital, Dr. Muhammad Rizki Yaznil, M.Ked (OG), Sp.OG (K), revealed this to the USU website team, Thursday (8/5/2021), by telephone. Previously, the USU Hospital Cathlab had worked on several other diagnostic procedures. Had stopped for some time, Cathlab services have resumed in early June 2021.

Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is known in layman's language as the installation of a coronary artery ring (known to the layman as constriction heart disease). PCI is one of the modern treatment options in the management of coronary heart disease. 

Dr. Muhammad Rizki Yaznil on behalf of the Directors of USU Hospital hopes that the steps taken by USU Hospital can pave the way for sustainable USU Hospital Cathlab services, provide benefits for patients, and to achieve further goals. The team involved in the PCI Action was Dr. Yolandi Sumadio, SpJP, Dr. Cut Aryfa Andra, SpJP, Dr. Andi Khairul, SpJP and Dr. Yasmin Fitria, SpJP.

Furthermore, Dr. Rizki explained that the cardiac catheterization procedure is a minimally invasive procedure by inserting a small tube (catheter) into an artery and/or vein and tracing it to the heart and or other targeted organs with the help of X-rays and contrast. Services that can be done are diagnostic procedures (coronary angiography, peripheral vascular angiography, carotid artery angiography, left and right heart catheterization, pericardiocentesis, etc.) and interventional procedures (treatment). 

"With the PCI (ring installation) procedure being able to be carried out at USU Hospital, it is hoped that it can help in better service for heart patients and according to national and even international standards," concluded Dr Rizky optimistically. (©ULC)
