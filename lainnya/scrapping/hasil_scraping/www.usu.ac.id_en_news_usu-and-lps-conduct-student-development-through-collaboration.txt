“In addition to expanding existing programs, I think it is very important to develop more comprehensive innovations that can produce quality student development programs,” added the USU Rector.

USU PR - In order to extend the form of cooperation between the Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) and the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS), an audience was held to discuss various joint follow-up activities agreed on Friday (1/11/2024) in the USU Rector's Audience Room.

As an institution that guarantees security in storing money in banks, LPS continues to carry out socialization in order to increase public confidence in using one of these types of banking. USU is the best option to be at the forefront and voice this socialization.

In addition to expanding cooperation with programs that have been carried out, it is very important to develop innovations that can support the activities of LPS, according to the USU Rector, Prof. Dr. Muryanto Amin S.Sos., M.Si. This collaboration is considered to be very in line with the essence of USU's 72nd Anniversary, namely in strengthening the higher education ecosystem, inclusive collaboration efforts are needed.

The USU Rector also mentioned that LPS is not a foreign partner for USU in developing activities for the academic community. Digital financial literacy is often carried out at USU which is expected to continue in the future.

“In addition to expanding existing programs, I think it is very important to develop more comprehensive innovations that can produce quality student development programs,” added the USU Rector.

Public lectures on socialization to students and the academic community are important pillars that LPS currently wants to execute. M. Yusron as the Head of LPS Representative Office I Medan explained that the socialization activities would later bring in leading speakers in their fields with a target implementation in December this year for all students in North Sumatra.

In addition, research or survey activities regarding LPS to the community will be carried out in North Sumatra with USU as the bridge. M. Yusron hopes that LPS can be known more closely to the entire community and academic community through the activities that have been carried out.

“USU and LPS have been working together for a long time, and this time, we are focusing on student development. One of the forms will be the socialization or national seminar,” said M.Yusron.
