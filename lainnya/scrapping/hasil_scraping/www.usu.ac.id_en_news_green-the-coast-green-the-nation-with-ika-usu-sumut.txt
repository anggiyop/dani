Muhammad Fidel Ganis Siregar M.Ked (OG), Sp.O.G, Subsp.F.E.R., gave a very high appreciation to IKA-USU SUMUT, who initiated the planting of 20,000 mangrove seedlings as a form of commitment to protect the earth and the environment so that it remains in balance.

"On behalf of the leadership of the Universitas Sumatera Utara, I would like to thank you. Yes, we appreciate the activities carried out by IKA-USU North Sumatra, which initiated the activities and is a form of commitment to protect the earth and the environment so that it remains in balance," said Prof. Dr. dr.
