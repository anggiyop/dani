"USU has launched a vocational faculty and we support the development of vocational education at USU such as preparing students to enter the world of work," explained Vice Rector I.

HUMAS - The Faculty of Vocational Studies, Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) held a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with the theme "Improving the Competitiveness of Vocational Education" which was held in the IMTGT room of USU on Monday (09/19/2022).

In the FGD aimed at increasing vocational competitiveness, the Universitas Sumatera Utara invited the Director General of Vocational Education, Dr. Ir. Kiki Yuliati, M.Sc as resource person. Not only that, this activity was also attended by Industry and the World of Work (IDUKA) and Vocational Schools, the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN), and several other stakeholders who also have an important role in improving and producing graduates that are in line with the needs of the industrial world.

USU Vice Rector I Dr. Edy Ikhsan, SH, MA said that he would fully support any educational development at USU Vocational Schools. It is hoped that the USU Vocational Faculty, which consists of 14 diploma majors, will be able to prepare students to be ready to enter the world of work.

"USU has launched a vocational faculty and we support the development of vocational education at USU such as preparing students to enter the world of work," explained Vice Rector I.

Acting Deputy Dean II of the USU Vocational Faculty Yasmin Chairunisa Muchtar SP., MBA hopes that later on we can invite back specifically IDUKA and SMK and establish cooperation up to the Implementation Agreement (IA) stage in order to achieve alignment of needs between industry and the world of education, such as by attending practitioner lecturers and carry out curriculum transformation.

"The Vocational Faculty will carry out the same as we specifically invite Vocational Schools and IDUKA to be able to establish cooperation, be it the MOU MOA and even for the Implementation Agreement," he said.

Yasmin Chairunisa Muchtar SP., MBA added that IDUKA and SMK will be the faculties of the Vocational Faculty.

Ricky, B.Bus., MM as the Standing Committee for the Training of the North Sumatra Chamber of Commerce and Industry also emphasized that the Vocational Faculty should pay more attention to future industrial demands. For this reason, the Vocational Faculty together with the North Sumatra KADIN will create a curriculum and go directly to the field to meet the industrial world.

"We very well welcome the existence of the Vocational Faculty but we ask the Vocational Faculty to pay more attention to how the industry's demand in the future will be," he said. (©ULC)
